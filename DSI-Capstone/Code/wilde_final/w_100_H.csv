0|LE JARDIN.      The lily's withered chalice falls       Around its rod of dusty gold,       And from the beech trees on the wold     The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.      The gaudy leonine sunflower       Hangs black and barren on its stalk,       And down the windy garden walk     The dead leaves scatter,--hour by hour.      Pale privet-petals white as milk       Are blown into a snowy mass;       The roses lie upon the grass,     Like little shreds of crimson silk.  LA MER.      A white mist drifts across the shrouds,       A wild moon in this wintry sky       Gleams like an angry lion's eye     Out of a mane of tawny clouds.      The muffled steersman at the wheel       Is but a shadow in the gloom;--       And in the throbbing engine room     Leap the long rods of polished steel.      The shattered storm has left its trace       Upon this huge and heaving dome,       For the thin threads of yellow foam     Float on the waves like ravelled lace.  I fear I cannot picture America as altogether an Elysium--perhaps, from the ordinary standpoint I know but little about the country. I cannot give its latitude or longitude; I cannot compute the value of its dry goods, and I have no very close acquaintance with its politics. These are matters which may not interest you, and they certainly are not interesting to me.  The first thing that struck me on landing in America was that if the Americans are not the most well-dressed people in the world, they are the most comfortably dressed. Men are seen there with the dreadful chimney-pot hat, but there are very few hatless men; men wear the shocking swallow-tail coat, but few are to be seen with no coat at all. There is an air of comfort in the appearance of the people which is a marked contrast to that seen in this country, where, too often, people are seen in close contact with rags.  The next thing particularly noticeable is that everybody seems in a hurry to catch a train. This is a state of things which is not favourable to poetry or romance. Had Romeo or Juliet been in a constant state of anxiety about trains, or had their minds been agitated by the question of return-tickets, Shakespeare could not have given us those lovely balcony scenes which are so full of poetry and pathos.  America is the noisiest country that ever existed. One is waked up in the morning, not by the singing of the nightingale, but by the steam whistle. It is surprising that the sound practical sense of the Americans does not reduce this intolerable noise. All Art depends upon exquisite and delicate sensibility, and such continual turmoil must ultimately be destructive of the musical faculty.  There is not so much beauty to be found in American cities as in Oxford, Cambridge, Salisbury or Winchester, where are lovely relics of a beautiful age; but still there is a good deal of beauty to be seen in them now and then, but only where the American has not attempted to create it. Where the Americans have attempted to produce beauty they have signally failed. A remarkable characteristic of the Americans is the manner in which they have applied science to modern life.  This is apparent in the most cursory stroll through New York. In England an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances invention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America an inventor is honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to wealth. There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as in America.  I have always wished to believe that the line of strength and the line of beauty are one. That wish was realised when I contemplated American machinery. It was not until I had seen the water-works at Chicago that I realised the wonders of machinery; the rise and fall of the steel rods, the symmetrical motion of the great wheels is the most beautifully rhythmic thing I have ever seen.[3] One is impressed in America, but not favourably impressed, by the inordinate size of everything. The country seems to try to bully one into a belief in its power by its impressive bigness.  I was disappointed with Niagara--most people must be disappointed with Niagara. Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of the stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest, disappointments in American married life. One sees it under bad conditions, very far away, the point of view not showing the splendour of the water. To appreciate it really one has to see it from underneath the fall, and to do that it is necessary to be dressed in a yellow oil-skin, which is as ugly as a mackintosh--and I hope none of you ever wears one. It is a consolation to know, however, that such an artist as Madame Bernhardt has not only worn that yellow, ugly dress, but has been photographed in it.  Perhaps the most beautiful part of America is the West, to reach which, however, involves a journey by rail of six days, racing along tied to an ugly tin-kettle of a steam engine. I found but poor consolation for this journey in the fact that the boys who infest the cars and sell everything that one can eat--or should not eat--were selling editions of my poems vilely printed on a kind of grey blotting paper, for the low price of ten cents.[4] Calling these boys on one side I told them that though poets like to be popular they desire to be paid, and selling editions of my poems without giving me a profit is dealing a blow at literature which must have a disastrous effect on poetical aspirants. The invariable reply that they made was that they themselves made a profit out of the transaction and that was all they cared about.  It is a popular superstition that in America a visitor is invariably addressed as ?Stranger.? I was never once addressed as ?Stranger.? When I went to Texas I was called ?Captain?; when I got to the centre of the country I was addressed as ?Colonel,? and, on arriving at the borders of Mexico, as ?General.? On the whole, however, ?Sir,? the old English method of addressing people is the most common.  It is, perhaps, worth while to note that what many people call Americanisms are really old English expressions which have lingered in our colonies while they have been lost in our own country. Many people imagine that the term ?I guess,? which is so common in America, is purely an American expression, but it was used by John Locke in his work on ?The Understanding,? just as we now use ?I think.?[5]  It is in the colonies, and not in the mother country, that the old life of the country really exists. If one wants to realise what English Puritanism is--not at its worst (when it is very bad), but at its best, and then it is not very good--I do not think one can find much of it in England, but much can be found about Boston and Massachusetts. We have got rid of it. America still preserves it, to be, I hope, a short-lived curiosity.  San Francisco is a really beautiful city. China Town, peopled by Chinese labourers, is the most artistic town I have ever come across. The people--strange, melancholy Orientals, whom many people would call common, and they are certainly very poor--have determined that they will have nothing about them that is not beautiful. In the Chinese restaurant, where these navvies meet to have supper in the evening, I found them drinking tea out of china cups as delicate as the petals of a rose-leaf, whereas at the gaudy hotels I was supplied with a delf cup an inch and a half thick. When the Chinese bill was presented it was made out on rice paper, the account being done in Indian ink as fantastically as if an artist had been etching little birds on a fan.  Salt Lake City contains only two buildings of note, the chief being the Tabernacle, which is in the shape of a soup-kettle. It is decorated by the only native artist, and he has treated religious subjects in the naive spirit of the early Florentine painters, representing people of our own day in the dress of the period side by side with people of Biblical history who are clothed in some romantic costume.  The building next in importance is called the Amelia Palace, in honour of one of Brigham Young's wives. When he died the present president of the Mormons stood up in the Tabernacle and said that it had been revealed to him that he was to have the Amelia Palace, and that on this subject there were to be no more revelations of any kind!  From Salt Lake City one travels over the great plains of Colorado and up the Rocky Mountains, on the top of which is Leadville, the richest city in the world. It has also got the reputation of being the roughest, and every man carries a revolver. I was told that if I went there they would be sure to shoot me or my travelling manager. I wrote and told them that nothing that they could do to my travelling manager would intimidate me. They are miners--men working in metals, so I lectured to them on the Ethics of Art. I read them passages from the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini and they seemed much delighted. I was reproved by my hearers for not having brought him with me. I explained that he had been dead for some little time which elicited the enquiry ?Who shot him?? They afterwards took me to a dancing saloon where I saw the only rational method of art criticism I have ever come across. Over the piano was printed a notice:--  The mortality among pianists in that place is marvellous. Then they asked me to supper, and having accepted, I had to descend a mine in a rickety bucket in which it was impossible to be graceful. Having got into the heart of the mountain I had supper, the first course being whisky, the second whisky and the third whisky.  I went to the Theatre to lecture and I was informed that just before I went there two men had been seized for committing a murder, and in that theatre they had been brought on to the stage at eight o?clock in the evening, and then and there tried and executed before a crowded audience. But I found these miners very charming and not at all rough.  Among the more elderly inhabitants of the South I found a melancholy tendency to date every event of importance by the late war. ?How beautiful the moon is to-night,? I once remarked to a gentleman who was standing next to me. ?Yes,? was his reply, ?but you should have seen it before the war.?  So infinitesimal did I find the knowledge of Art, west of the Rocky Mountains, that an art patron--one who in his day had been a miner--actually sued the railroad company for damages because the plaster cast of Venus of Milo, which he had imported from Paris, had been delivered minus the arms. And, what is more surprising still, he gained his case and the damages.  Pennsylvania, with its rocky gorges and woodland scenery, reminded me of Switzerland. The prairie reminded me of a piece of blotting-paper.  The Spanish and French have left behind them memorials in the beauty of their names. All the cities that have beautiful names derive them from the Spanish or the French. The English people give intensely ugly names to places. One place had such an ugly name that I refused to lecture there. It was called Grigsville. Supposing I had founded a school of Art there--fancy ?Early Grigsville.? Imagine a School of Art teaching ?Grigsville Renaissance.?  As for slang I did not hear much of it, though a young lady who had changed her clothes after an afternoon dance did say that ?after the heel kick she shifted her day goods.?  American youths are pale and precocious, or sallow and supercilious, but American girls are pretty and charming--little oases of pretty unreasonableness in a vast desert of practical common-sense.  Every American girl is entitled to have twelve young men devoted to her. They remain her slaves and she rules them with charming nonchalance.  The men are entirely given to business; they have, as they say, their brains in front of their heads. They are also exceedingly acceptive of new ideas. Their education is practical. We base the education of children entirely on books, but we must give a child a mind before we can instruct the mind. Children have a natural antipathy to books--handicraft should be the basis of education. Boys and girls should be taught to use their hands to make something, and they would be less apt to destroy and be mischievous.  In going to America one learns that poverty is not a necessary accompaniment to civilisation. There at any rate is a country that has no trappings, no pageants and no gorgeous ceremonies. I saw only two processions--one was the Fire Brigade preceded by the Police, the other was the Police preceded by the Fire Brigade.  Every man when he gets to the age of twenty-one is allowed a vote, and thereby immediately acquires his political education. The Americans are the best politically educated people in the world. It is well worth one's while to go to a country which can teach us the beauty of the word FREEDOM and the value of the thing LIBERTY.  The mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death.  Women are made to be loved, not to be understood.  It is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't. Moren than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.  Women, as someone says, love with their ears, just as men love with their eyes, if they ever love at all.  It is better to be beautiful than to be good, but it is better to be good than to be ugly.  Nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.  Misfortunes one can endure, they come from outside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's faults--ah! there is the sting of life.  Beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm. Philosophies fall away like sand, creeds follow one another, but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons, a possession for all eternity.  Questions are never indiscreet; answers sometimes are.  Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building.  The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes.  Anyone can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend's success.  Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live: and unselfishness is letting other people's lives alone, not interfering with them.  A man who does not think for himself does not think at all.  Nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation. It is not a speculation. It is a sacrament. Its ideal is love. Its purification is sacrifice.  In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbour. In fact, to be a bit better than one's neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle class. Nowadays, with our modern mania for morality, everyone has to pose as a paragon of purity, incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues. And what is the result? You all go over like ninepins--one after the other.  All sympathy is fine, but sympathy with suffering is the least fine mode.  If you pretend to be good the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to be bad it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.  It is most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public. It always makes people think that he beats her when they're alone. The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life.  Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.  Men know life too early; women know life too late-that is the difference between men and women.  He who stands most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best.  There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.  Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves and fibres and slowly built-up cells, in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  Man is a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex, multiform creature that bears within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh is tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.  As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter she is perfectly satisfied.  There is always something infinitely mean about other people's tragedies.  Public and private life are different things. They have different laws and move on different lines.  When one is placed in the position of guardian one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. It's one's duty to do so.  I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself.  If the lower classes don't set us a good example what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.  If a woman cannot make her mistakes charming she is only a female.  The world was made for men and not for women.  It is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done.  If you wish to understand others you must intensify your own individualism.  Why do you talk so trivially about life? Because I think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.  What a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us.  It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.  Relations are simply a tedious pack of people who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die.  Charity creates a multitude of sins.  My experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better they don't know anything at all.  Truth is a very complex thing and politics is a very complex business. There are wheels within wheels. One may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay. Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise. Everyone does.  Men can love what is beneath them--things unworthy, stained, dishonoured. We women worship when we love; and when we lose our worship we lose everything.  The proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding.  The one advantage of playing with fire is that one never gets even singed. It is the people who don't know how to play with it who get burned up.  There are moments when one has to choose between living one's own life fully, entirely, completely, or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.  When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.  Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic.  An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship. It starts in the right manner.  The truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks.  Science can never grapple with the irrational. That is why it has no future before it in this world.  The happy people of the world have their value, but only the negative value of foils. They throw up and emphasise the beauty and the fascination of the unhappy.  In this world there are only two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it. The last is much the worst--the last is a real tragedy.  Disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made--through disobedience and rebellion.  It is not wise to find symbols in everything that one sees. It makes life too full of terrors.  Comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us.  Politics are my only pleasure. You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy. And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures. I prefer politics. I think they are more ... becoming.  One's past is what one is. It is the only way by which people should be judged.  In a very ugly and sensible age the arts borrow, not from life, but from each other.  It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good advice is fatal.  Secrets from other people's wives are a necessary luxury in modern life. So, at least, I am told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better. But no man should have a secret from his own wife. She invariably finds it out. Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They discover everything except the obvious.  Life holds the mirror up to art, and either reproduces some strange type imagined by painter or sculptor or realises in fact what has been dreamed in fiction.  I feel sure that if I lived in the country for six months I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me.  To recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting. It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.  A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.  I am always saying what I shouldn't say; in fact, I usually say what I really think--a great mistake nowadays. It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.  The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is.  The basis of every scandal is an absolute immoral certainty.  People talk so much about the beauty of confidence. They seem to entirely ignore the much more subtle beauty of doubt. To believe is very dull. To doubt is intensely engrossing. To be on the alert is to live, to be lulled into security is to die.  Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.  It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions, my one quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It is the only thing he is fit for.  A high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness.  There are terrible temptations that it requires strength--strength and courage--to yield to. To stake all one's life on one throw--whether the stake be power or pleasure I care not--there is no weakness in that. There is a horrible, a terrible, courage.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs.  All charming people are spoiled. It is the secret of their attraction.  There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine. Personally, I have a great admiration for stupidity. It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose.  All men are monsters. The only thing to do is to feed the wretches well. A good cook does wonders.  There is no such thing as an omen.  Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.  Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.  Love art for its own sake and then all things that you need will be added to you. This devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is the test of all great civilisations; it is what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation.  It is always worth while asking a question, though it is not always answering one.  It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing.  With a proper background women can do anything.  Chiromancy is a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to be encouraged, except in a 't?te-?-t?te.'  One should never take sides in anything. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  The work of art is beautiful by being what art never has been; and to measure it by the standard of the past is to measure it by a standard on the reflection of which its real perfection depends.  There are three kinds of despots. There is the despot who tyrannises over the body. There is the despot who tyrannises over the soul. There is the despot who tyrannises over soul and body alike. The first is called the prince. The second is called the pope. The third is called the people.  Costume is a growth, an evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign of the manners, customs, and mode of life of each century.  I really don't see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to be in love, but there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty.  What consoles one nowadays is not repentance but pleasure. Repentance is quite out of date.  Ideals are dangerous things. Realities are better. They wound, but they are better.  Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow.  Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.  An eternal smile is much more wearisome than a perpetual frown. The one sweeps away all possibilities, the other suggests a thousand.  To disagree with three-fourths of England on all points is one of the first elements of vanity, which is a deep source of consolation in all moments of spiritual doubt.  Women live by their emotions and for them, they have no philosophy of life.  As long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have a fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular.  There is only one thing worse than injustice, and that is justice without her sword in her hand. When right is not might it is evil.  We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of life. Well, the secret of life is in art.  The truth isn't quite the sort of thing that one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  If one plays good music people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk.  How fond women are of doing dangerous things. It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.  Englishwomen conceal their feelings till after they are married. They show them then.  Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second. Words are perhaps the worst. Words are merciless.  Life is terrible. It rules us, we do not rule it.  In art there is no such thing as a universal truth. A truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true.  One's days are too brief to take the burden of another's sorrows on one's shoulders. Each man lives his own life, and pays his own price for living it. The only pity is that one has to pay so often for a single fault. One has to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man Destiny never closes her accounts.  Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval. When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy.  The people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty and their fidelity I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.  Better to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under a microscope.  Of Shakespeare it may be said that he was the first to see the dramatic value of doublets and that a climax may depend on a crinoline.  Plain women are always jealous of their husbands; beautiful women never are! They never have time. They are always so occupied in being jealous of other people's husbands.  What between the duties expected of one during one's lifetime and the duties exacted from one after one's death land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position and prevents one from keeping it up.  A man who moralises is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralises is invariably plain. There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a nonconformist conscience. And mo|2
1|st women know it, I am glad to say.  It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone and can be made as offensive as a brickbat.  A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing. And when Humanity lands there it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail. Progress is the realisation of Utopias.  What is the difference between scandal and gossip? Oh! gossip is charming! History is merely gossip, but scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.  All beautiful things belong to the same age.  It is personalities, not principles, that move the age.  Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at. At least, some of them are. But they are quite impossible to live with; they are too clever, too assertive, too intellectual. Their meaning is too obvious and their method too clearly defined. One exhausts what they have to say in a very short time, and then they become as tedious as one's relations.  To know nothing about our great men is one of the necessary elements of English education.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either and modern literature a complete impossibility.  You may laugh, but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one.  The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism.  The number of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.  The chief thing that makes life a failure from the artistic point of view is the thing that lends to life its sordid security--the fact that one can never repeat exactly the same emotion.  We teach people how to remember, we never teach them how to grow.  Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has given them an idea, whether one is serious or not. Nothing is serious except passion. The intellect is not a serious thing and never has been. It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all. The only serious form of intellect I know is the British intellect, and on the British intellect the illiterate always plays the drum.  It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.  It is only the modern that ever become old-fashioned.  It is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production.  Musical people are so absurdly unreasonable. They always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  The fact of a man being a poisoner is nothing against his prose. The domestic virtues are not the true basis of art.  To the philosopher women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.  The only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life.  The only horrible thing in the world is 'ennui.' That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.  French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  It has often been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature. As a rule this must necessarily be so. That very concentration of vision and inversity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation. To those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of so much importance.  The work of art is to dominate the spectator. The spectator is not to dominate the work of art.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life. The less said about life's sores the better.  You can't make people good by act of Parliament--that is something.  Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and having done so passes on to other things. Nature, on the other hand, forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating the effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.  A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public. The public are to him non-existent.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything.  Nothing is so aggravating as calmness. There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men. I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.  The truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible. Bad habit, by the way, makes one very unpopular at the club ... with the older members. They call it being conceited. Perhaps it is.  My own business always bores me to death. I prefer other people's.  Don't be led astray into the paths of virtue--that is the worst of women. They always want one to be good. And if we are good, when they meet us they don't love us at all. They like to find us quite irretrievably bad and to leave us quite unattractively good.  Men are such cowards. They outrage every law in the world and are afraid of the world's tongue.  Wicked women bother one. Good women bore one. That is the only difference between them.  To know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of all the arts.  I don't believe in the existence of Puritan women. I don't think there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made love to her. It is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable.  When I am in trouble eating is the only thing that consoles me. Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as anyone who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  When one is going to lead an entirely new life one requires regular and wholesome meals.  The soul is born old, but grows young. That is the comedy of life. The body is born young, and grows old. That is life's tragedy.  One can survive everything nowadays except death, and live down anything except a good reputation.  The past is of no importance. The present is of no importance. It is with the future that we have to deal. For the past is what men should not have been. The present is what men ought not to be. The future is what artists are.  Men become old, but they never become good.  By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.  I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is scrupulous always.  Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The god of this century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one must have wealth.  I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me. They have not got the charm of novelty.  Moderation is a fatal thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a feast.  The English can't stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, but they are very fond of a man who admits he has been in the wrong. It is one of the best things in them.  Life is simply a 'mauvais quart d'heure' made up of exquisite moments.  There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in hand. To shut one's eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice.  Married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they are not.  Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.  Everybody is clever nowadays. You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people. This has become an absolute public nuisance.  I don't think man has much capacity for development. He has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  I am not quite sure that I quite know what pessimism really means. All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity. It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  I do not approve of anything that that tampers with natural arrogance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit: touch it, and the blossom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately, in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  No woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating.  Emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of life and of that practical organisation of life that we call society.  Men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others. Modern, no less than ancient, history supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to. If it were not so, indeed, history would be quite unreadable.  I am not in favour of long engagements. They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.  It is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.  Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women who have of their own free choice remained thirty-five for years.  Never speak disrespectfully of society. Only people who can't get into it do that.  It is always painful to part with people whom one has known for a very brief space of time. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.  To be natural is to be obvious, and to be obvious is to be inartistic.  One is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.  The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth.  What people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities.  In a temple everyone should be serious except the thing that is worshipped.  We are never more true to ourselves than when we are inconsistent.  There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.  Intellectual generalities are always interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  To be in society is merely a bore, but to be out of it simply a tragedy.  We live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities.  One should never make one's d?but with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age.  What man has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply life. Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly. When he can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself. Pleasure is nature's test, her sign of approval. When man is happy he is in harmony with himself and his environment.  Society often forgives the criminal, it never forgives the dreamer.  It is so easy for people to have sympathy with suffering. It is so difficult for them to have sympathy with thought.  Conversation should touch on everything, but should concentrate itself on nothing.  There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.  There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating--people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing.  The public is wonderfully tolerant; it forgives everything except genius.  Life makes us pay too high a price for its wares, and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite.  This horrid House of Commons quite ruins our husbands for us. I think the Lower House by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing they called the Higher Education of Women was invented.  Once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not? And I don't like that. It makes men so very attractive.  Experience is a question of instinct about life.  What is true about art is true about life.  One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.  I like men who have a future and women who have a past.  Women, as some witty Frenchman put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.  In matters of grave importance style, not sincerity, is the vital thing.  The only way to behave to a woman, is to make love to her if she is pretty and to someone else if she is plain.  Women give to men the very gold of their lives. Possibly; but they invariably want it back in such very small change.  Define women as a sex? Sphinxes without secrets.  What do you call a bad man? The sort of man who admires innocence.  What do you call a bad woman? Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.  One can resist everything except temptation.  Don't let us go to life for our fulfilment or our experience. It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent in its utterance, and without that fine correspondence or form and spirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament.  It is a dangerous thing to reform anyone.  One can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon his life or not. I have noticed a very, very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men.  A mother who doesn't part with a daughter every season has no real affection.  To be good is to be in harmony with oneself. Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.  A really grand passion is comparatively rare nowadays. It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes in a country.  There is no secret of life. Life's aim, if it has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations. There are not nearly enough of them; I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one. It is quite dreadful. It makes one so nervous about the future.  All thought is immoral. Its very essence is destruction. If you think of anything you kill it; nothing survives being thought of.  What is truth? In matters of religion it is simply the opinion that has survived. In matters of science it is the ultimate sensation. In matters of art it is one's last mood.  It is so easy to convert others. It is so difficult to convert oneself.  A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.  Life cheats us with shadows, like a puppet-master. We ask it for pleasure. It gives it to us, with bitterness and disappointment in its train. We come across some noble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedy to our days, but it passes away from us, and things less noble take its place, and on some grey, windy dawn, or odorous eve of silence and of silver, we find ourselves looking with callous wonder, or dull heart of stone, at the tress of gold-flecked hair that we had once so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed.  There are two ways of disliking art One is to dislike it and the other to like it rationally.  There is nothing sane about the worship of beauty. It is too splendid to be sane. Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always seem to the world to be mere visionaries.  I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world. Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance.  A sentimentalist is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and doesn't know the marked price of any single thing.  Punctuality is the thief of time.  Self-culture is the true ideal for man.  There's nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman. It's a thing no married man knows anything about.  No woman should have a memory. Memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness. One can always tell from a woman's bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.  There are things that are right to say but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.  The meaning of any beautiful created thing is, at least, as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it. Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and sets it in some new relation to the age, so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of what, having prayed for, we fear that we may receive.  The Renaissance was great because it sought to solve no social problem, and busied itself not about such things, but suffered the individual to develop freely, beautifully, and naturally, and so had great and individual artists and great and individual men.  In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast. That is so dreadful of them! Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself, and one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.  No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything.  The development of the race depends on the development of the individual, and where self-culture has ceased to be the ideal the intellectual standard is instantly lowered and often ultimately lost.  An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.  To elope is cowardly; it is running away from danger, and danger has become so rare in modern life.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also.  The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden. It ends with Revelations.  In married life three is company and two is none.  Out of ourselves we can never pass, nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not.  Don't tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him.  When a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.  The highest criticism really is the record of one's own soul. It is more fascinating than history, as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and not abstract, real and not vague. It is the only civilised form of autobiography, as it deals, not with the events, but with the thoughts of one's life, not with life's physical accidents of deed or circumstance, but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind.  To know anything about oneself one must know all about others.  Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.  After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one's own relations.  Talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.  Man--poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man--belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years. He can't help himself; it is in his race. The history of women is very different. They have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common-sense; they saw its dangers from the first.  More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common-sense of the husband than by anything else. How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being.  It is very vulgar to talk about one's business. Only people like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner-parties.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don't mind hard work when there is no definite object of any kind.  To do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world, the most difficult and the most intellectual. To Plato, with his passion for wisdom, this was the noblest form of energy.  To Aristotle, with his passion for knowledge, this was the noblest form of energy also. It was to this that the passion for holiness led the saint and the mystic of medi?val days.  Youth! There is nothing like it. It is absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are persons much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder.  Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.  I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.  There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to life. The old are in life's lumber-room. But youth is the lord of life. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. Everyone is born a king, and most people die in exile--like most kings.  All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.  Society, civilised society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating. It instinctively feels that manners are of more importance than morals, and in its opinion the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner or poor wine is irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold entrees.  While, in the opinion of society, contemplation is the gravest thing of which any citizen can be guilty, in the opinion of the highest culture it is the proper occupation of man.  Life is terribly deficient in form. Its catastrophes happen in the wrong way and to the wrong people. There is a grotesque horror about its comedies, and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce. One is always wounded when one approaches it. Things last either too long or not long enough.  If a woman wants to hold a man she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him.  We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.  Beauty has as many meanings as man has moods. It is the symbol of symbols. It reveals everything, because it expresses nothing. When it shows us itself it shows us the whole fiery-coloured world.  Men always want to be a woman's first love. That is their clumsy vanity. Women have a more subtle instinct about things. What they like is to be a man's last romance.  Anything approaching to the free play of the mind is practically unknown amongst us. People cry out against the sinner, yet it is not the sinful but the stupid who are our shame. There is no sin except stupidity.  One regrets the loss even of one's worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an essential part of one's personality.  It is through art, and through art only, that we can realise our perfection; through art and through art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.  A man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world. The future belongs to the dandy. It is the exquisites who are going to rule.  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthrals us.  When a woman finds out that her husband is absolutely indifferent to her, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for.  It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.  It is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour-that is all.  It is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artist's life is that he cannot realise his ideal. But the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely. For when the ideal is realised it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, and becomes simply a new starting-point for an ideal that is other than itself.  People who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference is that their moods are rather meaningless.  It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.  Good women have such a limited view of life, their horizon is so small, their interests so petty. The fact is they are not modern, and to be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays.  Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.  Men marry because they are tired, women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.  All men are married women's property. That is the only true definition of what married women's property really is.  I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment's notice. As a man sows so let him reap.  Nothing refines but the intellect.  It is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth. It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  The man who regards his past is a man who deserves to have no future to look forward to.  Just as it is only by contact with the art of foreign nations that the art of a country gains that individual and separate life that we call nationality, so, by curious inversion, it is only by intensifying his own personality that the critic can interpret the personality of others; and the more strongly this personality enters into the interpretation the more real the interpretation becomes, the more satisfying, the more convincing, and the more true.  Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.  All women become like their mothers: that is their tragedy. No man does: that is his.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex. Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.  One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.  No man came across two ideal things. Few come across one.  To become the spectator of one's own life is to escape the suffering of life.  The state is to make what is useful. The individual is to make what is beautiful.  A community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime.  The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature and not on its growth and development.  Jealousy, which is an extraordinary source of crime in modern life, is an emotion closely bound up with our conceptions of property, and under socialism and individualism will die out. It is remarkable that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown.  All art is i|2
2|mmoral.  He to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives. To realise the nineteenth century one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.  The history of woman is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known; the tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.  The happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married.  There is no one type for man. There are as many perfections as there are imperfect men. And while to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all.  A practical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence or a scheme that could be carried out under existing conditions.  All imitation in morals and in life is wrong.  The world has been made by fools that wise men may live in it.  Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.  Society is a necessary thing. No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him--and women rule society. If you have not got women on your side you are quite over. You might just as well be a barrister or a stockbroker or a journalist at once.  The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried; men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organised forms of existence. But it is probable the true nature of the senses has never been understood, and that they have remained savage and animal merely because the world has sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty will be the dominant characteristic.  Women appreciate cruelty more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves, looking for their master all the same. They love being dominated.  Those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob. It is through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the way of the gods must be prepared.  Circumstances are the lashes laid on to us by life. Some of us have to receive them with bared ivory backs, and others are permitted to keep on a coat--that is the only difference.  Criticism is itself an art.... It is no more to be judged by any low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work of poet or sculptor. The critic occupies the same relation to the work of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visible world of form and colour or the unseen world of passion and thought. He does not even require for the perfection of his art the finest materials. Anything will serve his purpose.  It is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it. In the sphere of actual life that is, of course, obvious. Anybody can make history, only a great man can write it.  If we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be filled with a wild remorse and those whom the world calls evil stirred with a noble joy. Each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life, which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before.  Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them, sometimes they forgive them.  We live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too much to be beautiful.  One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.  It will be a marvellous thing--the true personality of man--when we see it. It will grow naturally and simply flowerlike, or as a tree grows. It will not be at discord. It will never argue or dispute. It will not prove things. It will know everything, and yet it will not busy itself about knowledge. It will have wisdom. Its value will not be measured by material things. It will have nothing, and yet it will have everything, and whatever one takes from it it will still have, so rich it will be. It will not be always meddling with others or asking them to be like itself. It will love them because they will be different. And yet, while it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing helps us, by being what it is. The personality of man will be very wonderful. It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child.  Cynicism is merely the art of seeing things as they are instead of as they ought to be.  Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  If one doesn't talk about a thing it has never happened. It is simply expression that gives reality to things.  No man is able who is unable to get on, just as no woman is clever who can't succeed in obtaining that worst and most necessary of evils, a husband.  The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it. If they were allowed their way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art.  Each time that one loves is the only time that one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it.  The real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.  Human life is the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there is nothing else of any value. It is true that as one watches life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure one cannot wear over one's face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There are poisons so subtle that to know their properties one has to sicken of them. There are maladies so strange that one has to pass through them if one seeks to understand their nature. And yet what a great reward one receives! How wonderful the whole world becomes to one! To note the curious, hard logic of passion and the emotional, coloured life of the intellect--to observe where they meet, and where they separate, at what point they are in unison and at what point they are in discord--there is a delight in that! What matter what the cost is? One can never pay too high a price for any sensation.  There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else. That is the misery of being poor.  To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist--that is all.  Personality is a very mysterious thing. A man cannot always be estimated by what he does. He may keep the law, and yet be worthless. He may break the law, and yet be fine. He may be bad without ever doing anything bad. He may commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin his true perfection.  Medi?val art is charming, but medi?val emotions are out of date. One can use them in fiction, of course; but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the only things that one has ceased to use in fact.  Man is complete in himself.  What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.  It's the old, old story. Love--well, not at first sight--but love at the end of the season, which is so much more satisfactory.  No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons! It looks so fast!  Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us now and then some of those luxurious, sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.  What is the difference between literature and journalism? Journalism is unreadable and literature is unread.  I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That would be hypocrisy.  My husband is a sort of promissory note; I am tired of meeting him.  Conscience makes egotists of us all.  Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history.  There is a fatality about good resolutions-they are always made too late.  We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.  Anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilised. Civilisation is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.  What nonsense people talk about happy marriages! A man can be happy with any woman so long as he does not love her.  The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romance.  In the common world of fact the wicked are not punished nor the good rewarded. Success is given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak.  Nothing should be able to harm a man except himself. Nothing should be able to rob a man at all. What a man really has is what is in him. What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance.  Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.  Perplexity and mistrust fan affection into passion, and so bring about those beautiful tragedies that alone make life worth living. Women once felt this, while men did not, and so women once ruled the world.  Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's, face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things.  If a wretched man has a vice it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the drop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.  There are sins whose fascination is more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratify the pride more than the passions and give to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than they bring or can ever bring to the senses.  No civilised man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilised man ever knows what a pleasure is.  As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature you have merely to reform it.  Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism.  Some years ago people went about the country saying that property has duties. It is perfectly true. Property not merely has duties, but has so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore. If property had simply pleasures we could stand it, but its duties make it unbearable.  It is through joy that the individualism of the future will develop itself. Christ made no attempt to reconstruct society, and consequently the individualism that He preached to man could be realised only through pain or in solitude.  Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. To have ruined oneself over poetry is an honour.  The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply on what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are.  What are the virtues? Nature, Renan tells us, cares little about chastity, and it may be that it is to the shame of the Magdalen, and not to their own purity, that the Lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain. Charity, as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge, creates a multitude of evils. The mere existence of conscience, that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays, and are so ignorantly proud, is a sign of our imperfect development. It must be merged in instinct before we become fine. Self-denial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress, and self-sacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage, part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world, and which even now makes its victims day by day and has its altars in the land. Virtues! Who knows what the virtues are? Not you. Not I. Not anyone. It is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime. It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest.  Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married men.  The higher education of men is what I should like to see. Men need it so sadly.  The world is perfectly packed with good women. To know them is a middle-class education.  Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.  Our husbands never appreciate anything in us. We have to go to others for that.  Most women in London nowadays seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids, foreigners and French novels.  The canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is sincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.  The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young.  A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realise.  Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them.  If a man treats life artistically his brain is his heart.  The 'Peerage' is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done.  The world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them. Consequently whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.  What is termed sin is an essential element of progress. Without it the world would stagnate or grow old or becomes colourless. By its curiosity it increases the experience of the race. Through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from the commonplace. In its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics.  Formerly we used to canonise our heroes. The modern method is to vulgarise them. Cheap editions of great books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable.  Individualism does not come to man with any claims upon him at all. It comes naturally and inevitably out of man. It is the point to which all development tends. It is the differentiation to which all organisms grow. It is the perfection that is inherent in every mode of life and toward which every mode of life quickens. Individualism exercises no compulsion over man. On the contrary, it says to man that he should suffer no compulsion to be exercised over him. It does not try to force people to be good. It knows that people are good when they are let alone. Man will develop individualism out of himself. Man is now so developing individualism. To ask whether individualism is practical is like asking whether evolution is practical. Evolution is the law of life, and there is no evolution except towards individualism.  The longer I live the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, 'les grand p?res ont toujours tort.'  No woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say but they say it charmingly.  Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the cave men had known how to laugh history would have been different.  I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational.  Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.  To get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people--that is all.  You should never try to understand women. Women are pictures, men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really means--which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do--look at her, don't listen to her.  Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable mauve.  Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary charm in them--sometimes.  To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays. It shuts one out from so much.  The people who have adored me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have always insisted on living on long after I had ceased to care for them or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of women! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals!  Examinations are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him.  Credit is the capital of a younger son, and he can live charmingly on it.  The object of art is not simply truth but complex beauty. Art itself is really a form of exaggeration, and selection, which is the very spirit of art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis.  The popular cry of our time is: 'Let us return to Life and Nature, they will recreate Art for us and send the red blood coursing through her veins; they will shoe her feet with swiftness and make her hand strong.' But, alas! we are mistaken in our amiable and well-meant efforts. Nature is always behind the age. And as for life, she is the solvent that breaks up Art, the enemy that lays waste her house.  There are only two kinds of women--the plain and the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a reputation for respectability you have merely to take them down to supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake, however--they paint in order to try and look young.  The way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality we must see it on the tight-rope. When the verities become acrobats we can judge them.  Life imitates art far more than art imitates life.... The Greeks with their quick, artistic instinct understood this, and set in the bride's chamber the statue of Hermes or of Apollo, that she might bear children as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain. They knew that life gains from art not merely spirituality, depth of thought and feeling, soul-turmoil or soul-peace, but that she can form herself on the very lines and colours of art, and can reproduce the dignity of Pheidias as well as the grace of Praxiteles. Hence came this objection to realism. They disliked it on purely social grounds. They felt that it inevitably makes people ugly, and they were perfectly right.  Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect--simply a confession of failure.  There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.  What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful and are not; old men want to be faithless and cannot--that is all one can say.  Modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter are entirely and absolutely wrong. We have mistaken the common livery of the age for the vesture of the muses, and spent our days in the sordid streets and hideous suburbs of our vile cities when we should be out on the hillside with Apollo. Certainly we are a degraded race, and have sold our birthright for a mess of facts.  Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.  I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.  Those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a single exquisite instant, eternal, indeed, in its beauty but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm. Those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror, of courage and despair, of pleasure and of suffering. The seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant, and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them. They have their youth and their manhood, they are children, and they grow old. It is always dawn for St Helena as Veronese saw her at the window. Through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of God's pain. The cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow. On that little hill by the city of Florence, where the lovers of Giorgione are lying, it is always the solstice of noon--of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim, naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass, and the long fingers of the lute player rest idly upon the chords. It is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom Corot set free among the silver poplars of France. In eternal twilight they move, those frail, diaphanous figures, whose tremulous, white feet seem not to touch the dew-drenched grass they tread on. But those who walk in epos, drama, or romance see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane, and watch the night from evening into morning star, and from sunrise into sun-setting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow. For them, as for us, the flowers bloom and wither, and the earth, that green-tressed goddess, as Coleridge calls her, alters her raiment for their pleasure. The statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection. The image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change. If they know nothing of death it is because they know little of life, for the secrets of life and death belong to those, and to those only, whom the sequence of time affects, and who possess not merely the present but the future, and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame. Movement, that problem of the visible arts, can be truly realised by literature alone. It is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest.  Behind every exquisite thing that exists there is something tragic. Worlds have to be in travail that the merest flower may blow.  Beauty is a form of genius--is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is one of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned, it has its divine right of sovereignty.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself.  Women spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever.  He's sure to be a wonderful success. He thinks like a Tory and talks like a Radical, and that's so important nowadays.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  We make gods of men and they leave us. Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes.  To me beauty is the Wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.  The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.  The thoroughly well-informed man is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.  Women have no appreciation of good looks in men--at least good women have none.  To influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of someone else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.  Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.  An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.  A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me.  The value of an idea has nothing whatever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.  He who would lead a Christ-like life is he who is perfectly and absolutely himself. He may be a great poet, or a great man of science; or a young student at the university, or one who watches sheep upon a moor; or a maker of dramas, like Shakespeare, or a thinker about God, like Spinoza; or a child who plays in a garden, or a fisherman who throws his nets into the sea. It does not matter what he is as long as he realises the perfection of the soul that is within him.  The aim of life is self-development. To realise one's nature perfectly--that is what each of us is here for.  There is no such thing as a good influence. All influence is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view.  Words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute, colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the Venetian or the Spaniard, and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze, but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs also--are theirs, indeed, alone.  There is nothing so absolutely pathetic as a really fine paradox. The pun is the clown among jokes, the well-turned paradox is the polished comedian, and the highest comedy verges upon tragedy, just as the keenest edge of tragedy is often tempered by a subtle humour. Our minds are shot with moods as a fabric is shot with colours, and our moods often seem inappropriate. Everything that is true is inappropriate.  The longer one studies life and literature the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual, and that it is not the moment that makes the man but the man who creates the age.  To know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accoun|2
3|ts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  To have a capacity for a passion, and not to realise it is to make oneself incomplete and limited.  Even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions. When people talk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely.  Every great man nowadays has his disciples and it is invariably Judas who writes the biography.  Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself. She is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance. She is a veil rather than a mirror. She has flowers that no forest knows of, birds that no woodland possesses. She makes and unmakes many worlds, and can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread. Hers are the 'forms more real than living man,' and hers the great archetypes, of which things that have existence are but unfinished copies. Nature has, in her eyes, no laws, no uniformity. She can work miracles at her will, and when she calls monsters from the deep they come. She can bid the almond-tree blossom in winter and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield. At her word the frost lays its silver finger on the burning mouth of June, and the winged lions creep out from the hollows of the Lydian hills. The dryads peer from the thicket as she passes by, and the brown fauns smile strangely at her when she comes near them. She has hawk-faced gods that worship her, and the centaurs gallop at her side.  In literature mere egotism is delightful.  If we live for aims we blunt our emotions. If we live for aims we live for one minute, for one day, for one year, instead of for every minute, every day, every year. The moods of one's life are life's beauties. To yield to all one's moods is to really live.  Many a young man starts in life with a natural gift for exaggeration which, if nurtured in congenial and sympathetic surroundings, or by the imitations of the best models, might grow into something really great and wonderful. But, as a rule, he comes to nothing. He either falls into careless habits of accuracy or takes to frequenting the society of the aged and the well-informed. Both things are equally fatal to his imagination.  The spirit of an age may be best expressed in the abstract ideal arts, for the spirit itself is abstract and ideal.  As for believing things, I can believe anything provided that it is quite incredible.  'Know thyself' was written over the portal of the antique world. Over the portal of the new world 'Be thyself' shall be written. And the message of Christ to man was simply: 'Be thyself.' That is the secret of Christ.  London is full of women who trust their husbands. One can always recognise them, they look so thoroughly unhappy.  For those who are not artists, and to whom there is no mode of life but the actual life of fact, pain is the only door to perfection.  The English public always feels perfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it.  Men always fall into the absurdity of endeavouring to develop the mind, to push it violently forward in this direction or in that. The mind should be receptive, a harp waiting to catch the winds, a pool ready to be ruffled, not a bustling busybody for ever trotting about on the pavement looking for a new bun shop.  There is nothing more beautiful than to forget, except, perhaps, to be forgotten.  All bad art comes from returning to life and nature, and elevating them into ideals. Life and nature may sometimes be used as part of art's rough material, but before they are of any real service to art they must be translated into artistic conventions. The moment art surrenders its imaginative medium it surrenders everything. As a method realism is a complete failure, and the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter.  Men may have women's minds just as women may have the minds of men.  London is too full of fogs and serious people. Whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs I don't know.  How marriage ruins a man! It's as demoralising as cigarettes, and far more expensive.  He must be quite respectable. One has never heard his name before in the whole course of one's life, which speaks volumes for a man nowadays.  Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it, but moulds it to its purpose.  As long as a thing is useful or necessary to us or affects us in any way, either for pain or pleasure, or appeals strongly to our sympathies or is a vital part of the environment in which we live, it is outside the proper sphere of art.  I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet: it is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it.  Music creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one's tears.  Nothing is so fatal to personality as deliberation.  I adore London dinner parties. The clever people never listen and the stupid people never talk.  Learned conversation is either the affection of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures--which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people--which was worse.  All art is quite useless.  Beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid.  The one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.  Secrecy seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.  Conceit is one of the greatest of the virtues, yet how few people recognise it as a thing to aim at and to strive after. In conceit many a man and woman has found salvation, yet the average person goes on all-fours grovelling after modesty.  It is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves.  Humanity will always love Rousseau for having confessed his sins not to a friend but to the world.  Just as those who do not love Plato more than truth cannot pass beyond the threshold of the Academe, so those who do not love beauty more than truth never know the inmost shrine of art.  There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction: the sort of fatality that seems to dog, through history, the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows.  To be born, or at any rate bred, in a handbag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.  There must be a new Hedonism that shall recreate life and save it from that harsh, uncomely Puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It must have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it must never accept any theory or system that will involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, is to be experience itself and not the fruits of experience, bitter or sweet as they may be. Of the 'stheticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it is to know nothing. But it is to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.  Art never expresses anything but itself. It has an independent life, just as thought has, and develops purely on its own lines. It is not necessarily realistic in an age of realism nor spiritual in an age of faith. So far from being the creation of its time it is usually in direct opposition to it, and the only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress.  People who mean well always do badly. They are like the ladies who wear clothes that don't fit them in order to show their piety. Good intentions are invariably ungrammatical.  Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the improbable.  When art is more varied nature will, no doubt, be more varied also.  If a man is sufficiently imaginative to produce evidence in support of a lie he might just as well speak the truth at once.  The ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact; the modern novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of fiction.  Nature is no great mother who has home us. She is our own creation. It is in our brain that she quickens to life. Things are because we see them, and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us. To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing. One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.  The proper school to learn art in is not life but art.  I won't tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice, or the voice of society. They matter a good deal. They matter far too much.  I wouldn't marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun.  I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly, but I don't see any chance of it just at present.  Modern memoirs are generally written by people who have entirely lost their memories and have never done anything worth recording.  Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.  Women are like minors, they live upon their expectations.  Twisted minds are as natural to some people as twisted bodies.  It is the very passions about whose origin we deceive ourselves that tyrannise most strongly over us. Our weakest motives are those of whose nature we are conscious. It often happens that when we think we are experimenting on others we are really experimenting on ourselves.  Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing it is always from the noblest motives.  I thought I had no heart. I find I have, and a heart doesn't suit me. Somehow it doesn't go with modern dress. It makes one look old, and it spoils one's career at critical moments.  I don't play accurately--anyone can play accurately--but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the piano is concerned sentiment is my forte. I keep science for life.  I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime.  Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching--that is really what our enthusiasm for education has come to.  Nature hates mind.  From the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling the actor's craft is the type.  Where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals--in dress, manner, tone of voice, religious opinions, personal appearance, tricks of habit, and the like.  The more we study art the less we care for Nature. What art really reveals to us is Nature's lack of design, her curious crudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition.... It is fortunate for us, however, that nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we should have had no art at all. Art is our spirited protest, our gallant attempt to teach Nature her proper place. As for the infinite variety of nature, that is a pure myth. It is not to be found in Nature herself. It resides in the imagination or fancy or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her.  Facts are not merely finding a footing-place in history but they are usurping the domain of fancy and have invaded the kingdom of romance. Their chilling touch is over everything. They are vulgarising mankind.  Ordinary people wait till life discloses to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life are revealed before the veil is drawn away. Sometimes this is the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature which deals immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex personality takes the place and assumes the office of art, is, indeed, in its way a real work of art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.  Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it just as they die of any other disease.  A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied.  The aim of the liar is simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure. He is the very basis of civilised society.  It is quite a mistake to believe, as many people do, that the mind shows itself in the face. Vice may sometimes write itself in lines and changes of contour, but that is all. Our faces are really masks given to us to conceal our minds with.  What on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence? A carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more effective.  The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.  People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.  It is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors.  Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  Conscience and cowardice are really the same things. Conscience is the trade name of the firm--that is all.  In every sphere of life form is the beginning of things. The rhythmic, harmonious gestures of dancing convey, Plato tells us, both rhythm and harmony into the mind. Forms are the food of faith, cried Newman, in one of those great moments of sincerity that make us admire and know the man. He was right, though he may not have known how terribly right he was. The creeds are believed not because they are rational but because they are repeated. Yes; form is everything. It is the secret of life. Find expression for a sorrow and it will become dear to you. Find expression for a joy and you intensify its ecstasy. Do you wish to love? Use love's litany and the words will create the yearning from which the world fancies that they spring. Have you a grief that corrodes your heart? Learn its utterance from Prince Hamlet and Queen Constance and you will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation and that form, which is the birth of passion, is also the death of pain. And so, to return to the sphere of art, it is form that creates not merely the critical temperament but also the 'sthetic instinct that reveals to one all things under the condition of beauty. Start with the worship of form and there is no secret in art that will not be revealed to you.  It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common-sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.  Lady Henry Wotton was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look picturesque but only succeeded in being untidy.  Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  With an evening coat and a white tie anybody, even a stockbroker, can gain a reputation for being civilised.  There is nothing so interesting as telling a good man or woman how bad one has been. It is intellectually fascinating. One of the greatest pleasures of having been wicked is that one has so much to say to the good.  Laws are made in order that people in authority may not remember them, just as marriages are made in order that the divorce court may not play about idly.  To get back one's youth one has merely to repeat one's follies.  Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair. They are so sentimental.  The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbours with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the high-wayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets. I have the greatest contempt for optimism.  Art begins with abstract decoration, with purely imaginative and pleasureable work dealing with what is unreal and non-existent. This is the first stage. Then life becomes fascinated with this new wonder, and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle. Art takes life as part of her rough material, recreates it and refashions it in fresh form; is absolutely indifferent to facts; invents, imagines, dreams, and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style, of decorative or ideal treatment. The third stage is when Life gets the upper hand and drives Art out into the wilderness. This is the true decadence, and it is from this that we are now suffering.  Good intentions have been the ruin of the world. The only people who have achieved anything have been those who have had no intentions at all.  I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.  You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish, and unselfish people are colourless--they lack individuality. Still there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organised, and to be highly organised is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage it is certainly an experience.  Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.  I never talk during music--at least not during good music. If anyone hears bad music it is one's duty to drown it in conversation.  When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself.  Faith is the most plural thing I know. We are all supposed to believe in the same thing in different ways. It is like eating out of the same dish with different coloured spoons.  Experience is of no ethical value. It is merely the name men give to their mistakes. Moralists have, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, have claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, have praised it as something that teaches us what to follow and shows us what to avoid. But there is no motive power in experience. It is as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrates is that our future will be the same as our past and that the sin we have done once, and with loathing, we shall do many times, and with joy.  Sensations are the details that build up the stories of our lives.  No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.  She looks like an 'edition de luxe' of a wicked French novel meant specially for the English market.  I never knew what terror was before; I know it now. It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one's heart. It is as if one's heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow.  We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.  No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved.  One knows so well the popular idea of health. The English country gentleman galloping along after a fox--the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable.  People seldom tell the truths that are worth telling. We ought to choose our truths as carefully as we choose our lies and to select our virtues with as much thought as we bestow upon the selection of our enemies.  Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they are! There is animalism in the soul, and the body has its moments of spirituality. The senses can refine and the intellect can degrade. Who can say where the fleshly impulse ceases or the psychical impulse begins? How shallow are the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Is the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or is the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter is a mystery, and the unison of spirit with matter is a mystery also.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written-that is all.  Marriage is a sort of forcing house. It brings strange sins to fruit, and sometimes strange renunciations.  The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  A sense of duty is like some horrible disease. It destroys the tissues of the mind, as certain complaints destroy the tissues of the body. The catechism has a great deal to answer for.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.  Few people have sufficient strength to resist the preposterous claims of orthodoxy.  She wore far too much rouge last night and not quite enough clothes. That is always a sign of despair in a woman.  A virtue is like a city set upon a hill--it cannot be hid. We can conceal our vices if we care to--for a time at least--but a virtue will out.  Can't make out how you stand London society. The thing has gone to the dogs: a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.  You don't know what an existence they lead down there. It is pure, unadulterated country life. They get up early because they have so much to do, and go to bed early because they have so little to think about.  Nothing is so fatal to a personality as the keeping of promises, unless it be telling the truth.  Who cares whether Mr Ruskin's views on Turner are sound or not? What does it matter? That mighty and majestic prose of his, so fervid and so fiery coloured in its noble eloquence, so rich in its elaborate symphonic music, so sure and certain, at its best, in subtle choice of word and epithet, is, at least, as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in England's gallery--greater, indeed, one is apt to think at times, not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety of its appeal--soul speaking to soul in those long, cadenced lines, not through form and colour alone, though through these, indeed, completely and without loss, but with intellectual and emotional utterance, with lofty passion and with loftier thought, with imaginative insight and with poetic aim--greater, I always think, even as literature is the greater art.  Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one.  Mrs Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every afternoon at 5.30. I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can't manage to have enough of them.  The world divides actions into three classes: good actions, bad actions that you may do, and bad actions that you may not do. If you stick to the good actions you are respected by the good. If you stick to the bad actions that you may do you are respected by the bad. But if you perform the bad actions that no one may do then the good and the bad set upon you and you are lost indeed.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.  The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To me the word 'natural' means all that is middle class, all that is of the essence of Jingoism, all that is colourless and without form and void. It might be a beautiful word, but it is the most debased coin in the currency of language.  I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment's solitude.  It is only when we have learned to love forgetfulness that we have learned the art of living.  To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.  The world taken 'en masse' is a monster, crammed with prejudices, packed with prepossessions, cankered with what it calls virtues, a Puritan, a prig. And the art of life is the art of defiance. To defy--that is what we ought to live for, instead of living, as we do, to acquiesce.  Some resemblance the creative work of the critic will have to the work that has stirred him to creation, but it will be such resemblance as exists, not between nature and the mirror that the painter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her, but between nature and the work of the decorative artist. Just as on the flowerless carpets of Persia tulip and rose blossom indeed, and are lovely to look on, though they are not reproduced in visible shape or line; just as the pearl and purple of the sea shell is echoed in the church of St Mark at Venice; just as the vaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at Ravenna is made gorgeous by the gold and green and sapphire of the peacock's tail, though the birds of Juno fly not across it; so the critic reproduces the work that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative, and part of whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance, and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also the mystery of beauty, and by transforming each art into literature solves once for all the problem of art's unity.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.   Nothing is more painful to me than to come across virtue in a person in whom I have never suspected its existence. It is like finding a needle in a bundle of hay. It pricks you. If we have virtue we should warn people of it.  The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.  Hopper is one of nature's gentlemen--the worst type of gentleman I know.  If one intends to be good one must take it up as a profession. It is quite the most engrossing one in the world.  I like Wagner's music better than anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says.  All art is at once surface and symbol.  Childhood is one long career of innocent eavesdropping, of hearing what one ought not to hear.  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.  The only things worth saying are those that we forget, just as the only things worth doing are those that the world is surprised at.  Maturity is one long career of saying what one ought not to say. That is the art of conversation.  Virtue is generally merely a form of deficiency, just as vice is an assertion of intellect.  People teach in order to conceal their ignorance, as people smile in order to conceal their tears.  To be unnatural is often to be great. To be natural is generally to be stupid.  To lie finely is an art, to tell the truth is to act according to nature.  People who talk sense are like people who break stones in the road: they cover one with dust and splinters.  Jesus said to man: You have a wonderful personality. Develop it. Be yourself. Don't imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things. Your perfection is inside of you. If only you could realise that you would not want to be rich. Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man, real riches cannot. In the treasury-house of your soul there are infinitely precious things that may not be taken from you. Try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you, and try also to get rid of personal property. It involves sordid preoccupation, en|2
4|dless industry, continual wrong. Personal property hinders individualism at every step.  When Jesus talks about the poor He simply means personalities, just as when He talks about the rich He simply means people who have not developed their personalities.  An echo is often more beautiful than the voice it repeats. As one enters Rome from the Via Ostiensis by the Porta San Paolo, the first object that meets the eye is a marble pyramid which stands close at hand on the left.  There are many Egyptian obelisks in Rome?tall, snakelike spires of red sandstone, mottled with strange writings, which remind us of the pillars of flame which led the children of Israel through the desert away from the land of the Pharaohs; but more wonderful than these to look upon is this gaunt, wedge-shaped pyramid standing here in this Italian city, unshattered amid the ruins and wrecks of time, looking older than the Eternal City itself, like terrible impassiveness turned to stone.  And so in the Middle Ages men supposed this to be the sepulchre of Remus, who was slain by his own brother at the founding of the city, so ancient and mysterious it appears; but we have now, perhaps unfortunately, more accurate information about it, and know that it is the tomb of one Caius Cestius, a Roman gentleman of small note, who died about 30 B.C.  Yet though we cannot care much for the dead man who lies in lonely state beneath it, and who is only known to the world through his sepulchre, still this pyramid will be ever dear to the eyes of all English-speaking people, because at evening its shadows fall on the tomb of one who walks with Spenser, and Shakespeare, and Byron, and Shelley, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning in the great procession of the sweet singers of England.  For at its foot there is a green sunny slope, known as the Old Protestant Cemetery, and on this a common-looking grave, which bears the following inscription:  And the name of the young English poet is John Keats.  Lord Houghton calls this cemetery ?one of the most beautiful spots on which the eye and heart of man can rest,? and Shelley speaks of it as making one ?in love with death, to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place?; and indeed when I saw the violets and the daisies and the poppies that overgrow the tomb, I remembered how the dead poet had once told his friend that he thought the ?intensest pleasure he had received in life was in watching the growth of flowers,? and how another time, after lying a while quite still, he murmured in some strange prescience of early death, ?I feel the flowers growing over me.?  But this time-worn stone and these wildflowers are but poor memorials {2} of one so great as Keats; most of all, too, in this city of Rome, which pays such honour to her dead; where popes, and emperors, and saints, and cardinals lie hidden in ?porphyry wombs,? or couched in baths of jasper and chalcedony and malachite, ablaze with precious stones and metals, and tended with continual service.  For very noble is the site, and worthy of a noble monument; behind looms the grey pyramid, symbol of the world's age, and filled with memories of the sphinx, and the lotus leaf, and the glories of old Nile; in front is the Monte Testaccio, built, it is said, with the broken fragments of the vessels in which all the nations of the East and the West brought their tribute to Rome; and a little distance off, along the slope of the hill under the Aurelian wall, some tall gaunt cypresses rise, like burnt-out funeral torches, to mark the spot where Shelley's heart (that ?heart of hearts?!) lies in the earth; and, above all, the soil on which we tread is very Rome!  As I stood beside the mean grave of this divine boy, I thought of him as of a Priest of Beauty slain before his time; and the vision of Guido's St. Sebastian came before my eyes as I saw him at Genoa, a lovely brown boy, with crisp, clustering hair and red lips, bound by his evil enemies to a tree, and though pierced by arrows, raising his eyes with divine, impassioned gaze towards the Eternal Beauty of the opening heavens.  And thus my thoughts shaped themselves to rhyme:                                HEU MISERANDE PUER      Rid of the world's injustice and its pain,        He rests at last beneath God's veil of blue;        Taken from life while life and love were new     The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,     Fair as Sebastian and as foully slain.        No cypress shades his grave, nor funeral yew,        But red-lipped daisies, violets drenched with dew,     And sleepy poppies, catch the evening rain.      O proudest heart that broke for misery!        O saddest poet that the world hath seen!           O sweetest singer of the English land!           Thy name was writ in water on the sand,        But our tears shall keep thy memory green,     And make it flourish like a Basil-tree.  During my tour in America I happened one evening to find myself in Louisville, Kentucky.  The subject I had selected to speak on was the Mission of Art in the Nineteenth Century, and in the course of my lecture I had occasion to quote Keats's Sonnet on Blue as an example of the poet's delicate sense of colour-harmonies.  When my lecture was concluded there came round to see me a lady of middle age, with a sweet gentle manner and a most musical voice.  She introduced herself to me as Mrs. Speed, the daughter of George Keats, and invited me to come and examine the Keats manuscripts in her possession.  I spent most of the next day with her, reading the letters of Keats to her father, some of which were at that time unpublished, poring over torn yellow leaves and faded scraps of paper, and wondering at the little Dante in which Keats had written those marvellous notes on Milton.  Some months afterwards, when I was in California, I received a letter from Mrs. Speed asking my acceptance of the original manuscript of the sonnet which I had quoted in my lecture. This manuscript I have had reproduced here, as it seems to me to possess much psychological interest.  It shows us the conditions that preceded the perfected form, the gradual growth, not of the conception but of the expression, and the workings of that spirit of selection which is the secret of style.  In the case of poetry, as in the case of the other arts, what may appear to be simply technicalities of method are in their essence spiritual not mechanical, and although, in all lovely work, what concerns us is the ultimate form, not the conditions that necessitate that form, yet the preference that precedes perfection, the evolution of the beauty, and the mere making of the music, have, if not their artistic value, at least their value to the artist.  It will be remembered that this sonnet was first published in 1848 by Lord Houghton in his _Life_, _Letters_, _and Literary Remains of John Keats_.  Lord Houghton does not definitely state where he found it, but it was probably among the Keats manuscripts belonging to Mr. Charles Brown.  It is evidently taken from a version later than that in my possession, as it accepts all the corrections, and makes three variations.  As in my manuscript the first line is torn away, I give the sonnet here as it appears in Lord Houghton's edition.  In the _Athen?um_ of the 3rd of June 1876 appeared a letter from Mr. A. J. Horwood, stating that he had in his possession a copy of _The Garden of Florence_ in which this sonnet was transcribed.  Mr. Horwood, who was unaware that the sonnet had been already published by Lord Houghton, gives the transcript at length.  His version reads _hue_ for _life_ in the first line, and _bright_ for _wide_ in the second, and gives the sixth line thus:  a foot too long: it also reads _to_ for _of_ in the ninth line.  Mr. Buxton Forman is of opinion that these variations are decidedly genuine, but indicative of an earlier state of the poem than that adopted in Lord Houghton's edition.  However, now that we have before us Keats's first draft of his sonnet, it is difficult to believe that the sixth line in Mr. Horwood's version is really a genuine variation.  Keats may have written,  and the transcript may have been carelessly made, but having got his line right in his first draft, Keats probably did not spoil it in his second. The _Athen?um_ version inserts a comma after _art_ in the last line, which seems to me a decided improvement, and eminently characteristic of Keats's method.  I am glad to see that Mr. Buxton Forman has adopted it.  As for the corrections that Lord Houghton's version shows Keats to have made in the eighth and ninth lines of this sonnet, it is evident that they sprang from Keats's reluctance to repeat the same word in consecutive lines, except in cases where a word's music or meaning was to be emphasized.  The substitution of ?its? for ?his? in the sixth line is more difficult of explanation.  It was due probably to a desire on Keats's part not to mar by any echo the fine personification of Hesperus.  It may be noticed that Keats's own eyes were brown, and not blue, as stated by Mrs. Proctor to Lord Houghton.  Mrs. Speed showed me a note to that effect written by Mrs. George Keats on the margin of the page in Lord Houghton's _Life_ (p. 100, vol. i.), where Mrs. Proctor's description is given.  Cowden Clarke made a similar correction in his _Recollections_, and in some of the later editions of Lord Houghton's book the word ?blue? is struck out.  In Severn's portraits of Keats also the eyes are given as brown.  The exquisite sense of colour expressed in the ninth and tenth lines may be paralleled by      The Ocean with its vastness, its blue green,  of the sonnet to George Keats.  A man can live for three days without bread, but no man can live for one day without poetry, was an aphorism of Baudelaire.  You can live without pictures and music but you cannot live without eating, says the author of _Dinners and Dishes_; and this latter view is, no doubt, the more popular.  Who, indeed, in these degenerate days would hesitate between an ode and an omelette, a sonnet and a salmis?  Yet the position is not entirely Philistine; cookery is an art; are not its principles the subject of South Kensington lectures, and does not the Royal Academy give a banquet once a year?  Besides, as the coming democracy will, no doubt, insist on feeding us all on penny dinners, it is well that the laws of cookery should be explained: for were the national meal burned, or badly seasoned, or served up with the wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might follow.  Under these circumstances we strongly recommend _Dinners and Dishes_ to every one: it is brief and concise and makes no attempt at eloquence, which is extremely fortunate.  For even on ortolans who could endure oratory?  It also has the advantage of not being illustrated.  The subject of a work of art has, of course, nothing to do with its beauty, but still there is always something depressing about the coloured lithograph of a leg of mutton.  As regards the author's particular views, we entirely agree with him on the important question of macaroni.  ?Never,? he says, ?ask me to back a bill for a man who has given me a macaroni pudding.?  Macaroni is essentially a savoury dish and may be served with cheese or tomatoes but never with sugar and milk.  There is also a useful description of how to cook risotto?a delightful dish too rarely seen in England; an excellent chapter on the different kinds of salads, which should be carefully studied by those many hostesses whose imaginations never pass beyond lettuce and beetroot; and actually a recipe for making Brussels sprouts eatable.  The last is, of course, a masterpiece.  The real difficulty that we all have to face in life is not so much the science of cookery as the stupidity of cooks.  And in this little handbook to practical Epicureanism the tyrant of the English kitchen is shown in her proper light.  Her entire ignorance of herbs, her passion for extracts and essences, her total inability to make a soup which is anything more than a combination of pepper and gravy, her inveterate habit of sending up bread poultices with pheasants,?all these sins and many others are ruthlessly unmasked by the author.  Ruthlessly and rightly.  For the British cook is a foolish woman who should be turned for her iniquities into a pillar of salt which she never knows how to use.  But our author is not local merely.  He has been in many lands; he has eaten back-hendl at Vienna and kulibatsch at St. Petersburg; he has had the courage to face the buffalo veal of Roumania and to dine with a German family at one o?clock; he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous white truffles of Turin of which Alexandre Dumas was so fond; and, in the face of the Oriental Club, declares that Bombay curry is better than the curry of Bengal.  In fact he seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except the 'square meal? of the Americans.  This he should study at once; there is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the United States.  Boston beans may be dismissed at once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back ducks, blue fish and the pompono of New Orleans are all wonderful delicacies, particularly when one gets them at Delmonico's.  Indeed, the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the States are undoubtedly Delmonico's and the Yosemit? Valley; and the former place has done more to promote a good feeling between England and America than anything else has in this century.  We hope the ?Wanderer? will go there soon and add a chapter to _Dinners and Dishes_, and that his book will have in England the influence it deserves.  There are twenty ways of cooking a potato and three hundred and sixty-five ways of cooking an egg, yet the British cook, up to the present moment, knows only three methods of sending up either one or the other.  I have often heard people wonder what Shakespeare would say, could he see Mr. Irving's production of his _Much Ado About Nothing_, or Mr. Wilson Barrett's setting of his _Hamlet_.  Would he take pleasure in the glory of the scenery and the marvel of the colour?  Would he be interested in the Cathedral of Messina, and the battlements of Elsinore?  Or would he be indifferent, and say the play, and the play only, is the thing?  Speculations like these are always pleasurable, and in the present case happen to be profitable also.  For it is not difficult to see what Shakespeare's attitude would be; not difficult, that is to say, if one reads Shakespeare himself, instead of reading merely what is written about him.  Speaking, for instance, directly, as the manager of a London theatre, through the lips of the chorus in _Henry V._, he complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce the pageant of a big historical play, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many of its most picturesque incidents, apologises for the scanty number of supers who had to play the soldiers, and for the shabbiness of the properties, and, finally, expresses his regret at being unable to bring on real horses.  In the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, again, he gives us a most amusing picture of the straits to which theatrical managers of his day were reduced by the want of proper scenery.  In fact, it is impossible to read him without seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two special limitations of the Elizabethan stage?the lack of suitable scenery, and the fashion of men playing women's parts, just as he protests against other difficulties with which managers of theatres have still to contend, such as actors who do not understand their words; actors who miss their cues; actors who overact their parts; actors who mouth; actors who gag; actors who play to the gallery, and amateur actors.  And, indeed, a great dramatist, as he was, could not but have felt very much hampered at being obliged continually to interrupt the progress of a play in order to send on some one to explain to the audience that the scene was to be changed to a particular place on the entrance of a particular character, and after his exit to somewhere else; that the stage was to represent the deck of a ship in a storm, or the interior of a Greek temple, or the streets of a certain town, to all of which inartistic devices Shakespeare is reduced, and for which he always amply apologizes.  Besides this clumsy method, Shakespeare had two other substitutes for scenery?the hanging out of a placard, and his descriptions.  The first of these could hardly have satisfied his passion for picturesqueness and his feeling for beauty, and certainly did not satisfy the dramatic critic of his day.  But as regards the description, to those of us who look on Shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as a poet, and who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing him acted, it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at his command such skilled machinists as are in use now at the Princess's and at the Lyceum.  For had Cleopatra's barge, for instance, been a structure of canvas and Dutch metal, it would probably have been painted over or broken up after the withdrawal of the piece, and, even had it survived to our own day, would, I am afraid, have become extremely shabby by this time.  Whereas now the beaten gold of its poop is still bright, and the purple of its sails still beautiful; its silver oars are not tired of keeping time to the music of the flutes they follow, nor the Nereid's flower-soft hands of touching its silken tackle; the mermaid still lies at its helm, and still on its deck stand the boys with their coloured fans.  Yet lovely as all Shakespeare's descriptive passages are, a description is in its essence undramatic.  Theatrical audiences are far more impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to; and the modern dramatist, in having the surroundings of his play visibly presented to the audience when the curtain rises, enjoys an advantage for which Shakespeare often expresses his desire.  It is true that Shakespeare's descriptions are not what descriptions are in modern plays?accounts of what the audience can observe for themselves; they are the imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the spectators the image of that which he desires them to see.  Still, the quality of the drama is action.  It is always dangerous to pause for picturesqueness.  And the introduction of self-explanatory scenery enables the modern method to be far more direct, while the loveliness of form and colour which it gives us, seems to me often to create an artistic temperament in the audience, and to produce that joy in beauty for beauty's sake, without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, to which, and to which only, are they ever revealed.  To talk of the passion of a play being hidden by the paint, and of sentiment being killed by scenery, is mere emptiness and folly of words. A noble play, nobly mounted, gives us double artistic pleasure.  The eye as well as the ear is gratified, and the whole nature is made exquisitely receptive of the influence of imaginative work.  And as regards a bad play, have we not all seen large audiences lured by the loveliness of scenic effect into listening to rhetoric posing as poetry, and to vulgarity doing duty for realism?  Whether this be good or evil for the public I will not here discuss, but it is evident that the playwright, at any rate, never suffers.  Indeed, the artist who really has suffered through the modern mounting of plays is not the dramatist at all, but the scene-painter proper.  He is rapidly being displaced by the stage-carpenter.  Now and then, at Drury Lane, I have seen beautiful old front cloths let down, as perfect as pictures some of them, and pure painter's work, and there are many which we all remember at other theatres, in front of which some dialogue was reduced to graceful dumb-show through the hammer and tin-tacks behind. But as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties, which are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scene-paintings, but far less beautiful, and far less true.  Properties kill perspective. A painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the excessive use of built-up structures always makes the stage too glaring, for as they have to be lit from behind, as well as from the front, the gas-jets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the painter has desired to show us.  So, instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright, it were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards restoring the scene-painter to his proper position as an artist, and not allowing him to be built over by the property man, or hammered to death by the carpenter.  I have never seen any reason myself why such artists as Mr. Beverley, Mr. Walter Hann, and Mr. Telbin should not be entitled to become Academicians.  They have certainly as good a claim as have many of those R.A.'s whose total inability to paint we can see every May for a shilling.  And lastly, let those critics who hold up for our admiration the simplicity of the Elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a condition of things against which Shakespeare himself, in the spirit of a true artist, always strongly protested.  I have been told that the ambition of every Dramatic Club is to act _Henry IV_.  I am not surprised.  The spirit of comedy is as fervent in this play as is the spirit of chivalry; it is an heroic pageant as well as an heroic poem, and like most of Shakespeare's historical dramas it contains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts, each of which is absolutely individual in character, and each of which contributes to the evolution of the plot.  To Oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the stage this noble play, and the production which I saw last week was in every way worthy of that lovely town, that mother of sweetness and of light.  For, in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union, and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector, in spite of Keble College, and the tramways, and the sporting prints, Oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in England, and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended, so perfectly made one.  Indeed, in most other towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction against the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives, but at Oxford she comes to us as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of life's joy.  She finds her home by the Isis as once she did by the Ilissus; the Magdalen walks and the Magdalen cloisters are as dear to her as were ever the silver olives of Colonus and the golden gateway of the house of Pallas: she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to Christ Church Hall, and looks out from the windows of Merton; her feet have stirred the Cumnor cowslips, and she gathers fritillaries in the river-fields.  To her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the lecture-room are a weariness and a vexation of spirit; she seeks not to define virtue, and cares little for the categories; she smiles on the swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her, and rejoices in the young Barbarians at their games; she watches the rowers from the reedy bank and gives myrtle to her lovers, and laurels to her poets, and rue to those who talk wisely in the street; she makes the earth lovely to all who dream with Keats; she opens high heaven to all who soar with Shelley; and turning away her head from pedant, proctor and Philistine, she has welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors, knowing that they have sought with much ardour for the stern secret of Melpomene, and caught with much gladness the sweet laughter of Thalia.  And to me this ardour and this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the Oxford performance, as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine dramatic production.  For without quick and imaginative observation of life the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation, and what is not conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to others.  I know that there are many who consider that Shakespeare is more for the study than for the stage.  With this view I do not for a moment agree. Shakespeare wrote the plays to be acted, and we have no right to alter the form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work. Indeed, many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to us only through the actor's art.  As I sat in the Town Hall of Oxford the other night, the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to gain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them, and the ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by the chivalrous bearing, the noble gesture and the fine passion of its exponents.  Even the dresses had their dramatic value.  Their arch?ological accuracy gave us, immediately on the rise of the curtain, a perfect picture of the time.  As the knights and nobles moved across the stage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle, we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the play's action was passing, for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and grace of its apparel was living actually before us, and the delicate harmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which added to the intellectual realism of arch?ology the sensuous charm of art.  I have rarely seen a production better stage-managed.  Indeed, I hope that the University will take some official notice of this delightful work of art.  Why should not degrees be granted for good acting?  Are they not given to those who misunderstand Plato and who mistranslate Aristotle?  And should the artist be passed over?  No.  To Prince Hal, Hotspur and Falstaff, D.C.L.'s should be gracefully offered.  I feel sure they would be gracefully accepted.  To the rest of the company the crimson or the sheepskin hood might be assigned _honoris caus?_ to the eternal confusion of the Philistine, and the rage of the industrious and the dull.  Thus would Oxford confer honour on herself, and the artist be placed in his proper position.  However, whether or not Convocation recognizes the claims of culture, I hope that the Oxford Dramatic Society will produce every summer for us some noble play like _Henry IV_.  For, in plays of this kind, plays which deal with bygone times, there is always this peculiar charm, that they combine in one exquisite presentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that is dead.  And when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique form, the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased realism.  This was Shakespeare's own attitude towards the ancient world, this is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays, and with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant young Oxonians were working.  If it was so, their aim is the right one. For while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism, we ask of the actor to give realism to romance.  In spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly recommended to every one.  As for the authorities the author quotes, they are almost numberless, and range from Socrates down to Artemus Ward.  He tells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as ?a very harmless amusement? and advised a young friend of his to ?marry early and marry often?; of Dr. Johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by the Lord Chancellor, without the parties concerned having any choice in the matter; of the Sussex labourer who asked, ?Why should I give a woman half my victuals for cooking the other half?? and of Lord Verulam who thought that unmarried men did the best public work.  And, indeed, marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree.  Our author, however, is clearly of the same opinion as the Scotch lassie who, on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was to get married, answered, ?I ken that, father, but it's a great deal solemner to be single.?  He may be regarded as the champion of the married life.  Indeed, he has a mo|2
5|st interesting chapter on marriage-made men, and though he dissents, and we think rightly, from the view recently put forward by a lady or two on the Women's Rights platform that Solomon owed all his wisdom to the number of his wives, still he appeals to Bismarck, John Stuart Mill, Mahommed, and Lord Beaconsfield, as instances of men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they married.  Archbishop Whately once defined woman as ?a creature that does not reason and pokes the fire from the top,? but since his day the higher education of women has considerably altered their position.  Women have always had an emotional sympathy with those they love; Girton and Newnham have rendered intellectual sympathy also possible.  In our day it is best for a man to be married, and men must give up the tyranny in married life which was once so dear to them, and which, we are afraid, lingers still, here and there.  ?Do you wish to be my wife, Mabel?? said a little boy.  ?Yes,? incautiously answered Mabel.  ?Then pull off my boots.?  On marriage vows our author has, too, very sensible views and very amusing stories.  He tells of a nervous bridegroom who, confusing the baptismal and marriage ceremonies, replied when asked if he consented to take the bride for his wife: ?I renounce them all?; of a Hampshire rustic who, when giving the ring, said solemnly to the bride: ?With my body I thee wash up, and with all my hurdle goods I thee and thou?; of another who when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife, replied with shameful indecision: ?Yes, I?m willin?; but I?d a sight rather have her sister?; and of a Scotch lady who, on the occasion of her daughter's wedding, was asked by an old friend whether she might congratulate her on the event, and answered: ?Yes, yes, upon the whole it is very satisfactory; it is true Jeannie hates her gudeman, but then there's always a something!?  Indeed, the good stories contained in this book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading, while the good advice is on all points admirable.  Most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a perfect museum of salt-cellars.  We strongly recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents.  It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and the Baedeker of bliss.  Books, I fancy, may be conveniently divided into three classes:  1.  Books to read, such as Cicero's _Letters_, Suetonius, Vasari's _Lives of the Painters_, the _Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini_, Sir John Mandeville, Marco Polo, St. Simon's _Memoirs_, Mommsen, and (till we get a better one) Grote's _History of Greece_.  2.  Books to re-read, such as Plato and Keats: in the sphere of poetry, the masters not the minstrels; in the sphere of philosophy, the seers not the _savants_.  3.  Books not to read at all, such as Thomson's _Seasons_, Rogers's _Italy_, Paley's _Evidences_, all the Fathers except St. Augustine, all John Stuart Mill except the essay on _Liberty_, all Voltaire's plays without any exception, Butler's _Analogy_, Grant's _Aristotle_, Hume's _England_, Lewes's _History of Philosophy_, all argumentative books and all books that try to prove anything.  The third class is by far the most important.  To tell people what to read is, as a rule, either useless or harmful; for, the appreciation of literature is a question of temperament not of teaching; to Parnassus there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning. But to tell people what not to read is a very different matter, and I venture to recommend it as a mission to the University Extension Scheme.  Indeed, it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours, an age that reads so much, that it has no time to admire, and writes so much, that it has no time to think.  Whoever will select out of the chaos of our modern curricula ?The Worst Hundred Books,? and publish a list of them, will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit.  After expressing these views I suppose I should not offer any suggestions at all with regard to ?The Best Hundred Books,? but I hope you will allow me the pleasure of being inconsistent, as I am anxious to put in a claim for a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent judges who have contributed to your columns.  I mean the _Greek Anthology_.  The beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me to hold the same position with regard to Greek dramatic literature as do the delicate little figurines of Tanagra to the Phidian marbles, and to be quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the Greek spirit.  I am also amazed to find that Edgar Allan Poe has been passed over. Surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place?  If, in order to make room for him, it be necessary to elbow out some one else, I should elbow out Southey, and I think that Baudelaire might be most advantageously substituted for Keble.  No doubt, both in the _Curse of Kehama_ and in the _Christian Year_ there are poetic qualities of a certain kind, but absolute catholicity of taste is not without its dangers.  It is only an auctioneer who should admire all schools of art.  Of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century few, if any, can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident the letters of George Sand which have recently been translated into English by M. Ledos de Beaufort.  They extend over a space of more than sixty years, from 1812 to 1876, in fact, and comprise the first letters of Aurore Dupin, a child of eight years old, as well as the last letters of George Sand, a woman of seventy-two.  The very early letters, those of the child and of the young married woman, possess, of course, merely a psychological interest; but from 1831, the date of Madame Dudevant's separation from her husband and her first entry into Paris life, the interest becomes universal, and the literary and political history of France is mirrored in every page.  For George Sand was an indefatigable correspondent; she longs in one of her letters, it is true, for ?a planet where reading and writing are absolutely unknown,? but still she had a real pleasure in letter-writing. Her greatest delight was the communication of ideas, and she is always in the heart of the battle.  She discusses pauperism with Louis Napoleon in his prison at Ham, and liberty with Armand Barbes in his dungeon at Vincennes; she writes to Lamennais on philosophy, to Mazzini on socialism, to Lamartine on democracy, and to Ledru-Rollin on justice. Her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the soul of a great woman, of a woman who was one with all the noblest movements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless absolutely.  For the aristocracy of intellect she had always the deepest veneration, but the democracy of suffering touched her more.  She preached the regeneration of mankind, not with the noisy ardour of the paid advocate, but with the enthusiasm of the true evangelist.  Of all the artists of this century she was the most altruistic; she felt every one's misfortunes except her own.  Her faith never left her; to the end of her life, as she tells us, she was able to believe without illusions. But the people disappointed her a little.  She saw that they followed persons not principles, and for ?the great man theory? George Sand had no respect.  ?Proper names are the enemies of principles? is one of her aphorisms.  So from 1850 her letters are more distinctly literary.  She discusses modern realism with Flaubert, and play-writing with Dumas _fils_; and protests with passionate vehemence against the doctrine of _L?art pour l?art_.  ?Art for the sake of itself is an idle sentence,? she writes; ?art for the sake of truth, for the sake of what is beautiful and good, that is the creed I seek.?  And in a delightful letter to M. Charles Poncy she repeats the same idea very charmingly.  ?People say that birds sing for the sake of singing, but I doubt it.  They sing their loves and happiness, and in that they are in keeping with nature.  But man must do something more, and poets only sing in order to move people and to make them think.?  She wanted M. Poncy to be the poet of the people and, if good advice were all that had been needed, he would certainly have been the Burns of the workshop.  She drew out a delightful scheme for a volume to be called _Songs of all Trades_ and saw the possibilities of making handicrafts poetic.  Perhaps she valued good intentions in art a little too much, and she hardly understood that art for art's sake is not meant to express the final cause of art but is merely a formula of creation; but, as she herself had scaled Parnassus, we must not quarrel at her bringing Proletarianism with her.  For George Sand must be ranked among our poetic geniuses.  She regarded the novel as still within the domain of poetry.  Her heroes are not dead photographs; they are great possibilities.  Modern novels are dissections; hers are dreams.  ?I make popular types,? she writes, 'such as I do no longer see, but such as they should and might be.?  For realism, in M. Zola's acceptation of the word, she had no admiration.  Art to her was a mirror that transfigured truths but did not represent realities.  Hence she could not understand art without personality.  ?I am aware,? she writes to Flaubert, ?that you are opposed to the exposition of personal doctrine in literature.  Are you right?  Does not your opposition proceed rather from a want of conviction than from a principle of 'sthetics?  If we have any philosophy in our brain it must needs break forth in our writings.  But you, as soon as you handle literature, you seem anxious, I know not why, to be another man, the one who must disappear, who annihilates himself and is no more.  What a singular mania!  What a deficient taste!  The worth of our productions depends entirely on our own.  Besides, if we withhold our own opinions respecting the personages we create, we naturally leave the reader in uncertainty as to the opinion he should himself form of them.  That amounts to wishing not to be understood, and the result of this is that the reader gets weary of us and leaves us.?  She herself, however, may be said to have suffered from too dominant a personality, and this was the reason of the failure of most of her plays.  Of the drama in the sense of disinterested presentation she had no idea, and what is the strength and life-blood of her novels is the weakness of her dramatic works.  But in the main she was right.  Art without personality is impossible.  And yet the aim of art is not to reveal personality, but to please.  This she hardly recognized in her 'sthetics, though she realized it in her work.  On literary style she has some excellent remarks.  She dislikes the extravagances of the romantic school and sees the beauty of simplicity.  ?Simplicity,? she writes, ?is the most difficult thing to secure in this world: it is the last limit of experience and the last effort of genius.?  She hated the slang and _argot_ of Paris life, and loved the words used by the peasants in the provinces.  ?The provinces,? she remarks, ?preserve the tradition of the original tongue and create but few new words.  I feel much respect for the language of the peasantry; in my estimation it is the more correct.?  She thought Flaubert too much preoccupied with the sense of form, and makes these excellent observations to him?perhaps her best piece of literary criticism.  ?You consider the form as the aim, whereas it is but the effect.  Happy expressions are only the outcome of emotion and emotion itself proceeds from a conviction.  We are only moved by that which we ardently believe in.?  Literary schools she distrusted. Individualism was to her the keystone of art as well as of life.  ?Do not belong to any school: do not imitate any model,? is her advice.  Yet she never encouraged eccentricity.  ?Be correct,? she writes to Eug?ne Pelletan, ?that is rarer than being eccentric, as the time goes.  It is much more common to please by bad taste than to receive the cross of honour.?  On the whole, her literary advice is sound and healthy.  She never shrieks and she never sneers.  She is the incarnation of good sense.  And the whole collection of her letters is a perfect treasure-house of suggestions both on art and on politics.  A philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible form of government is an absolute monarchy tempered by street ballads.  Without at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but regret that the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for the expression of political opinion.  The Socialists, it is true, have been heard singing the later poems of Mr. William Morris, but the street ballad is really dead in England.  The fact is that most modern poetry is so artificial in its form, so individual in its essence and so literary in its style, that the people as a body are little moved by it, and when they have grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer strikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels.  Possibly, Mr. William Toynbee's pleasant little volume of translations from B?ranger may be the herald of a new school.  B?ranger had all the qualifications for a popular poet.  He wrote to be sung more than to be read; he preferred the Pont Neuf to Parnassus; he was patriotic as well as romantic, and humorous as well as humane.  Translations of poetry as a rule are merely misrepresentations, but the muse of B?ranger is so simple and na?ve that she can wear our English dress with ease and grace, and Mr. Toynbee has kept much of the mirth and music of the original.  Here and there, undoubtedly, the translation could be improved upon; ?rapiers? for instance is an abominable rhyme to ?forefathers?; ?the hated arms of Albion? in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of ?le l?opard de l?Anglais,? and such a verse as  reproduces very inadequately the charm of the original:  On the whole, however, Mr. Toynbee's work is good; _Les Champs_, for example, is very well translated, and so are the two delightful poems _Rosette_ and _Ma R?publique_; and there is a good deal of spirit in _Le Marquis de Carabas_:  though ?that blade immaculate? has hardly got the sting of ?un sabre innocent?; and in the fourth verse of the same poem, ?Marquise, you?ll have the bed-chamber? does not very clearly convey the sense of the line ?La Marquise a le tabouret.?  B?ranger is not nearly well enough known in England, and though it is always better to read a poet in the original, still translations have their value as echoes have their music.  The Countess Martinengo deserves well of all poets, peasants and publishers.  Folk-lore is so often treated nowadays merely from the point of view of the comparative mythologist, that it is really delightful to come across a book that deals with the subject simply as literature.  For the Folk-tale is the father of all fiction as the Folk-song is the mother of all poetry; and in the games, the tales and the ballads of primitive people it is easy to see the germs of such perfected forms of art as the drama, the novel and the epic.  It is, of course, true that the highest expression of life is to be found not in the popular songs, however poetical, of any nation, but in the great masterpieces of self-conscious Art; yet it is pleasant sometimes to leave the summit of Parnassus to look at the wildflowers in the valley, and to turn from the lyre of Apollo to listen to the reed of Pan.  We can still listen to it.  To this day, the vineyard dressers of Calabria will mock the passer-by with satirical verses as they used to do in the old pagan days, and the peasants of the olive woods of Provence answer each other in am?b?an strains.  The Sicilian shepherd has not yet thrown his pipe aside, and the children of modern Greece sing the swallow-song through the villages in spring-time, though Theognis is more than two thousand years dead. Nor is this popular poetry merely the rhythmic expression of joy and sorrow; it is in the highest degree imaginative; and taking its inspiration directly from nature it abounds in realistic metaphor and in picturesque and fantastic imagery.  It must, of course, be admitted that there is a conventionality of nature as there is a conventionality of art, and that certain forms of utterance are apt to become stereotyped by too constant use; yet, on the whole, it is impossible not to recognize in the Folk-songs that the Countess Martinengo has brought together one strong dominant note of fervent and flawless sincerity.  Indeed, it is only in the more terrible dramas of the Elizabethan age that we can find any parallel to the Corsican _voceri_ with their shrill intensity of passion, their awful frenzies of grief and hate.  And yet, ardent as the feeling is, the form is nearly always beautiful.  Now and then, in the poems of the extreme South one meets with a curious crudity of realism, but, as a rule, the sense of beauty prevails.  Some of the Folk-poems in this book have all the lightness and loveliness of lyrics, all of them have that sweet simplicity of pure song by which mirth finds its own melody and mourning its own music, and even where there are conceits of thought and expression they are conceits born of fancy not of affectation.  Herrick himself might have envied that wonderful love-song of Provence:  How charming also is this lullaby by which the Corsican mother sings her babe to sleep!  Or this from Roumania:  We hardly know what poems are sung to English babies, but we hope they are as beautiful as these two.  Blake might have written them.  The Countess Martinengo has certainly given us a most fascinating book. In a volume of moderate dimensions, not too long to be tiresome nor too brief to be disappointing, she has collected together the best examples of modern Folk-songs, and with her as a guide the lazy reader lounging in his armchair may wander from the melancholy pine-forests of the North to Sicily's orange-groves and the pomegranate gardens of Armenia, and listen to the singing of those to whom poetry is a passion, not a profession, and whose art, coming from inspiration and not from schools, if it has the limitations, at least has also the loveliness of its origin, and is one with blowing grasses and the flowers of the field.  The production of _The Cenci_ last week at the Grand Theatre, Islington, may be said to have been an era in the literary history of this century, and the Shelley Society deserves the highest praise and warmest thanks of all for having given us an opportunity of seeing Shelley's play under the conditions he himself desired for it.  For _The Cenci_ was written absolutely with a view to theatric presentation, and had Shelley's own wishes been carried out it would have been produced during his lifetime at Covent Garden, with Edmund Kean and Miss O?Neill in the principal parts.  In working out his conception, Shelley had studied very carefully the 'sthetics of dramatic art.  He saw that the essence of the drama is disinterested presentation, and that the characters must not be merely mouthpieces for splendid poetry but must be living subjects for terror and for pity.  ?I have endeavoured,? he says, ?as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were, and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conception of right or wrong, false or true: thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind. . . .  ?I have avoided with great care the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry, and I imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description, unless Beatrice's description of the chasm appointed for her father's murder should be judged to be of that nature.?  He recognized that a dramatist must be allowed far greater freedom of expression than what is conceded to a poet.  ?In a dramatic composition,? to use his own words, ?the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another, the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter.  Imagination is as the immortal God which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion.  It is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling, which raises what is low, and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty, casting over all the shadow of its own greatness.  In other respects I have written more carelessly, that is, without an over-fastidious and learned choice of words.  In this respect I entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men.?  He knew that if the dramatist is to teach at all it must be by example, not by precept.  ?The highest moral purpose,? he remarks, ?aimed at in the highest species of the drama, is the teaching the human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies, the knowledge of itself; in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise, just, sincere, tolerant and kind.  If dogmas can do more it is well: but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them.?  He fully realizes that it is by a conflict between our artistic sympathies and our moral judgment that the greatest dramatic effects are produced.  ?It is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of Beatrice, yet feel that she has done what needs justification; it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge, that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists.?  In fact no one has more clearly understood than Shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama.  Many years ago, in a number of _All the Year Round_, Charles Dickens complained that Balzac was very little read in England, and although since then the public has become more familiar with the great masterpieces of French fiction, still it may be doubted whether the _Com?die Humaine_ is at all appreciated or understood by the general run of novel readers.  It is really the greatest monument that literature has produced in our century, and M. Taine hardly exaggerates when he says that, after Shakespeare, Balzac is our most important magazine of documents on human nature.  Balzac's aim, in fact, was to do for humanity what Buffon had done for the animal creation.  As the naturalist studied lions and tigers, so the novelist studied men and women.  Yet he was no mere reporter.  Photography and _proc's-verbal_ were not the essentials of his method.  Observation gave him the facts of life, but his genius converted facts into truths, and truths into truth.  He was, in a word, a marvellous combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit.  The latter he bequeathed to his disciples; the former was entirely his own.  The distinction between such a book as M. Zola's _L?Assommoir_ and such a book as Balzac's _Illusions Perdues_ is the distinction between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality.  ?All Balzac's characters,? said Baudelaire, ?are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself.  All his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams.  Every mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will.  The very scullions have genius.?  He was, of course, accused of being immoral.  Few writers who deal directly with life escape that charge. His answer to the accusation was characteristic and conclusive.  ?Whoever contributes his stone to the edifice of ideas,? he wrote, ?whoever proclaims an abuse, whoever sets his mark upon an evil to be abolished, always passes for immoral.  If you are true in your portraits, if, by dint of daily and nightly toil, you succeed in writing the most difficult language in the world, the word immoral is thrown in your face.?  The morals of the personages of the _Com?die Humaine_ are simply the morals of the world around us.  They are part of the artist's subject-matter; they are not part of his method.  If there be any need of censure it is to life, not to literature, that it should be given.  Balzac, besides, is essentially universal.  He sees life from every point of view.  He has no preferences and no prejudices.  He does not try to prove anything.  He feels that the spectacle of life contains its own secret.  ?Il cr?e un monde et se tait.?  And what a world it is!  What a panorama of passions!  What a pell-mell of men and women!  It was said of Trollope that he increased the number of our acquaintances without adding to our visiting list; but after the _Com?die Humaine_ one begins to believe that the only real people are the people who never existed.  Lucien de Rubempr?, le P?re Goriot, Ursule Mirou?t, Marguerite Cla's, the Baron Hulot, Madame Marneffe, le Cousin Pons, De Marsay?all bring with them a kind of contagious illusion of life.  They have a fierce vitality about them: their existence is fervent and fiery-coloured; we not merely feel for them but we see them?they dominate our fancy and defy scepticism.  A steady course of Balzac reduces our living friends to shadows, and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades.  Who would care to go out to an evening party to meet Tomkins, the friend of one's boyhood, when one can sit at home with Lucien de Rubempr??  It is pleasanter to have the entr?e to Balzac's society than to receive cards from all the duchesses in Mayfair.  In spite of this, there are many people who have declared the _Com?die Humaine_ to be indigestible.  Perhaps it is: but then what about truffles?  Balzac's publisher refused to be disturbed by any such criticism as that.  ?Indigestible, is it?? he exclaimed with what, for a publisher, was rare good sense.  ?Well, I should hope so; who ever thinks of a dinner that isn?t??  As for Mr. Symonds? estimate of Jonson's genius, it is in many points quite excellent.  He ranks him with the giants rather than with the gods, with those who compel our admiration by their untiring energy and huge strength of intellectual muscle, not with those ?who share the divine gifts of creative imagination and inevitable instinct.?  Here he is right.  Pelion more than Parnassus was Jonson's home.  His art has too much effort about it, too much definite intention.  His style lacks the charm of chance.  Mr. Symonds is right also in the stress he lays on the extraordinary combination in Jonson's work of the most concentrated realism with encyclop?dic erudition.  In Jonson's comedies London slang and learned scholarship go hand in hand.  Literature was as living a thing to him as life itself.  He used his classical lore not merely to give form to his verse, but to give flesh and blood to the persons of his plays.  He could build up a breathing creature out of quotations.  He made the poets of Greece and Rome terribly modern, and introduced them to the oddest company.  His very culture is an element in his coarseness. There are moments when one is tempted to liken him to a beast that has fed off books.  We cannot, however, agree with Mr. Symonds when he says that Jonson ?rarely touched more than the outside of character,? that his men and women are ?the incarnations of abstract properties rather than living human beings,? that they are in fact mere ?masqueraders and mechanical puppets.?  Eloquence is a beautiful thing but rhetoric ruins many a critic, and Mr. Symonds is essentially rhetorical.  When, for instance, he tells us that ?Jonson made masks,? while ?Dekker and Heywood created souls,? we feel that he is asking us to accept a crude judgment for the sake of a smart antithesis.  It is, of course, true that we do not find in Jonson the same growth of character that we find in Shakespeare, and we may admit that most of the characters in Jonson's plays are, so to speak, ready-made.  But a ready-made character is not necessarily either mechanical or wooden, two epithets Mr. Symonds uses constantly in his criticism.  We cannot tell, and Shakespeare himself does not tell us, why Iago is evil, why Regan and Goneril have hard hearts, or why Sir Andrew Aguecheek is a fool.  It is sufficient that they|2
6| are what they are, and that nature gives warrant for their existence.  If a character in a play is lifelike, if we recognize it as true to nature, we have no right to insist on the author explaining its genesis to us.  We must accept it as it is: and in the hands of a good dramatist mere presentation can take the place of analysis, and indeed is often a more dramatic method, because a more direct one.  And Jonson's characters are true to nature.  They are in no sense abstractions; they are types.  Captain Bobadil and Captain Tucca, Sir John Daw and Sir Amorous La Foole, Volpone and Mosca, Subtle and Sir Epicure Mammon, Mrs. Purecraft and the Rabbi Busy are all creatures of flesh and blood, none the less lifelike because they are labelled.  In this point Mr. Symonds seems to us unjust towards Jonson.  We think, also, that a special chapter might have been devoted to Jonson as a literary critic.  The creative activity of the English Renaissance is so great that its achievements in the sphere of criticism are often overlooked by the student.  Then, for the first time, was language treated as an art.  The laws of expression and composition were investigated and formularized.  The importance of words was recognized. Romanticism, Realism and Classicism fought their first battles.  The dramatists are full of literary and art criticisms, and amused the public with slashing articles on one another in the form of plays.  ?English Worthies.?  Edited by Andrew Lang.  _Ben Jonson_.  By John Addington Symonds.  (Longmans, Green and Co.)  Mr. Symonds has at last finished his history of the Italian Renaissance. The two volumes just published deal with the intellectual and moral conditions in Italy during the seventy years of the sixteenth century which followed the coronation of Charles the Fifth at Bologna, an era to which Mr. Symonds gives the name of the Catholic Reaction, and they contain a most interesting and valuable account of the position of Spain in the Italian peninsula, the conduct of the Tridentine Council, the specific organization of the Holy Office and the Company of Jesus, and the state of society upon which those forces were brought to bear.  In his previous volumes Mr. Symonds had regarded the past rather as a picture to be painted than as a problem to be solved.  In these two last volumes, however, he shows a clearer appreciation of the office of history.  The art of the picturesque chronicler is completed by something like the science of the true historian, the critical spirit begins to manifest itself, and life is not treated as a mere spectacle, but the laws of its evolution and progress are investigated also.  We admit that the desire to represent life at all costs under dramatic conditions still accompanies Mr. Symonds, and that he hardly realizes that what seems romance to us was harsh reality to those who were engaged in it.  Like most dramatists, also, he is more interested in the psychological exceptions than in the general rule.  He has something of Shakespeare's sovereign contempt of the masses.  The people stir him very little, but he is fascinated by great personalities.  Yet it is only fair to remember that the age itself was one of exaggerated individualism, and that literature had not yet become a mouthpiece for the utterances of humanity.  Men appreciated the aristocracy of intellect, but with the democracy of suffering they had no sympathy.  The cry from the brickfields had still to be heard.  Mr. Symonds? style, too, has much improved.  Here and there, it is true, we come across traces of the old manner, as in the apocalyptic vision of the seven devils that entered Italy with the Spaniard, and the description of the Inquisition as a Belial-Moloch, a ?hideous idol whose face was blackened with soot from burning human flesh.?  Such a sentence, also, as ?over the Dead Sea of social putrefaction floated the sickening oil of Jesuitical hypocrisy,? reminds us that rhetoric has not yet lost its charms for Mr. Symonds. Still, on the whole, the style shows far more reserve, balance and sobriety, than can be found in the earlier volumes where violent antithesis forms the predominant characteristic, and accuracy is often sacrificed to an adjective.  Amongst the most interesting chapters of the book are those on the Inquisition, on Sarpi, the great champion of the severance of Church from State, and on Giordano Bruno.  Indeed, the story of Bruno's life, from his visit to London and Oxford, his sojourn in Paris and wanderings through Germany, down to his betrayal at Venice and martyrdom at Rome, is most powerfully told, and the estimate of the value of his philosophy and the relation he holds to modern science, is at once just and appreciative.  The account also of Ignatius Loyola and the rise of the Society of Jesus is extremely interesting, though we cannot think that Mr. Symonds is very happy in his comparison of the Jesuits to ?fanatics laying stones upon a railway? or ?dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a corner of Westminster Hall.?  Such a judgment is harsh and crude in expression and more suitable to the clamour of the Protestant Union than to the dignity of the true historian.  Mr. Symonds, however, is rarely deliberately unfair, and there is no doubt but that his work on the Catholic Reaction is a most valuable contribution to modern history'so valuable, indeed, that in the account he gives of the Inquisition in Venice it would be well worth his while to bring the picturesque fiction of the text into some harmony with the plain facts of the footnote.  On the poetry of the sixteenth century Mr. Symonds has, of course, a great deal to say, and on such subjects he always writes with ease, grace, and delicacy of perception.  We admit that we weary sometimes of the continual application to literature of epithets appropriate to plastic and pictorial art.  The conception of the unity of the arts is certainly of great value, but in the present condition of criticism it seems to us that it would be more useful to emphasize the fact that each art has its separate method of expression.  The essay on Tasso, however, is delightful reading, and the position the poet holds towards modern music and modern sentiment is analysed with much subtlety.  The essay on Marino also is full of interest.  We have often wondered whether those who talk so glibly of Euphuism and Marinism in literature have ever read either _Euphues_ or the _Adone_.  To the latter they can have no better guide than Mr. Symonds, whose description of the poem is most fascinating.  Marino, like many greater men, has suffered much from his disciples, but he himself was a master of graceful fancy and of exquisite felicity of phrase; not, of course, a great poet but certainly an artist in poetry and one to whom language is indebted.  Even those conceits that Mr. Symonds feels bound to censure have something charming about them. The continual use of periphrases is undoubtedly a grave fault in style, yet who but a pedant would really quarrel with such periphrases as _sirena de? boschi_ for the nightingale, or _il novello Edimione_ for Galileo?  From the poets Mr. Symonds passes to the painters: not those great artists of Florence and Venice of whom he has already written, but the Eclectics of Bologna, the Naturalists of Naples and Rome.  This chapter is too polemical to be pleasant.  The one on music is much better, and Mr. Symonds gives us a most interesting description of the gradual steps by which the Italian genius passed from poetry and painting to melody and song, till the whole of Europe thrilled with the marvel and mystery of this new language of the soul.  Some small details should perhaps be noticed.  It is hardly accurate, for instance, to say that Monteverde's _Orfeo_ was the first form of the recitative-Opera, as Peri's _Dafne_ and _Euridice_ and Cavaliere's _Rappresentazione_ preceded it by some years, and it is somewhat exaggerated to say that ?under the regime of the Commonwealth the national growth of English music received a check from which it never afterwards recovered,? as it was with Cromwell's auspices that the first English Opera was produced, thirteen years before any Opera was regularly established in Paris.  The fact that England did not make such development in music as Italy and Germany did, must be ascribed to other causes than ?the prevalence of Puritan opinion.?  These, however, are minor points.  Mr. Symonds is to be warmly congratulated on the completion of his history of the Renaissance in Italy.  It is a most wonderful monument of literary labour, and its value to the student of Humanism cannot be doubted.  We have often had occasion to differ from Mr. Symonds on questions of detail, and we have more than once felt it our duty to protest against the rhetoric and over-emphasis of his style, but we fully recognize the importance of his work and the impetus he has given to the study of one of the vital periods of the world's history.  Mr. Symonds? learning has not made him a pedant; his culture has widened not narrowed his sympathies, and though he can hardly be called a great historian, yet he will always occupy a place in English literature as one of the remarkable men of letters in the nineteenth century.  Of all our modern poets, Mr. William Morris is the one best qualified by nature and by art to translate for us the marvellous epic of the wanderings of Odysseus.  For he is our only true story-singer since Chaucer; if he is a Socialist, he is also a Saga-man; and there was a time when he was never wearied of telling us strange legends of gods and men, wonderful tales of chivalry and romance.  Master as he is of decorative and descriptive verse, he has all the Greek's joy in the visible aspect of things, all the Greek's sense of delicate and delightful detail, all the Greek's pleasure in beautiful textures and exquisite materials and imaginative designs; nor can any one have a keener sympathy with the Homeric admiration for the workers and the craftsmen in the various arts, from the stainers in white ivory and the embroiderers in purple and gold, to the weaver sitting by the loom and the dyer dipping in the vat, the chaser of shield and helmet, the carver of wood or stone.  And to all this is added the true temper of high romance, the power to make the past as real to us as the present, the subtle instinct to discern passion, the swift impulse to portray life.  It is no wonder the lovers of Greek literature have so eagerly looked forward to Mr. Morris's version of the Odyssean epic, and now that the first volume has appeared, it is not extravagant to say that of all our English translations this is the most perfect and the most satisfying. In spite of Coleridge's well-known views on the subject, we have always held that Chapman's _Odyssey_ is immeasurably inferior to his _Iliad_, the mere difference of metre alone being sufficient to set the former in a secondary place; Pope's _Odyssey_, with its glittering rhetoric and smart antithesis, has nothing of the grand manner of the original; Cowper is dull, and Bryant dreadful, and Worsley too full of Spenserian prettinesses; while excellent though Messrs. Butcher and Lang's version undoubtedly is in many respects, still, on the whole, it gives us merely the facts of the _Odyssey_ without providing anything of its artistic effect.  Avia's translation even, though better than almost all its predecessors in the same field, is not worthy of taking rank beside Mr. Morris's, for here we have a true work of art, a rendering not merely of language into language, but of poetry into poetry, and though the new spirit added in the transfusion may seem to many rather Norse than Greek, and, perhaps at times, more boisterous than beautiful, there is yet a vigour of life in every line, a splendid ardour through each canto, that stirs the blood while one reads like the sound of a trumpet, and that, producing a physical as well as a spiritual delight, exults the senses no less than it exalts the soul.  It may be admitted at once that, here and there, Mr. Morris has missed something of the marvellous dignity of the Homeric verse, and that, in his desire for rushing and ringing metre, he has occasionally sacrificed majesty to movement, and made stateliness give place to speed; but it is really only in such blank verse as Milton's that this effect of calm and lofty music can be attained, and in all other respects blank verse is the most inadequate medium for reproducing the full flow and fervour of the Greek hexameter.  One merit, at any rate, Mr. Morris's version entirely and absolutely possesses.  It is, in no sense of the word, literary; it seems to deal immediately with life itself, and to take from the reality of things its own form and colour; it is always direct and simple, and at its best has something of the ?large utterance of the early gods.?  As for individual passages of beauty, nothing could be better than the wonderful description of the house of the Ph?acian king, or the whole telling of the lovely legend of Circe, or the manner in which the pageant of the pale phantoms in Hades is brought before our eyes.  Perhaps the huge epic humour of the escape from the Cyclops is hardly realized, but there is always a linguistic difficulty about rendering this fascinating story into English, and where we are given so much poetry we should not complain about losing a pun; and the exquisite idyll of the meeting and parting with the daughter of Alcinous is really delightfully told.  How good, for instance, is this passage taken at random from the Sixth Book:    It may be objected by some that the line  is a rather fanciful version of  and it certainly seems probable that the allusion is to the dark colour of the hero's hair; still, the point is not one of much importance, though it may be worth noting that a similar expression occurs in Ogilby's superbly illustrated translation of the _Odyssey_, published in 1665, where Charles II.'s Master of the Revels in Ireland gives the passage thus:  No anthology, however, can show the true merit of Mr. Morris's translation, whose real merit does not depend on stray beauties, nor is revealed by chance selections, but lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole, in its purity and justice of touch, its freedom from affectation and commonplace, its harmony of form and matter.  It is sufficient to say that this is a poet's version of a poet, and for such surely we should be thankful.  In these latter days of coarse and vulgar literature, it is something to have made the great sea-epic of the South native and natural to our northern isle, something to have shown that our English speech may be a pipe through which Greek lips can blow, something to have taught Nausicaa to speak the same language as Perdita.  Of the three great Russian novelists of our time Tourgenieff is by far the finest artist.  He has that spirit of exquisite selection, that delicate choice of detail, which is the essence of style; his work is entirely free from any personal intention; and by taking existence at its most fiery-coloured moments he can distil into a few pages of perfect prose the moods and passions of many lives.  Count Tolstoi's method is much larger, and his field of vision more extended.  He reminds us sometimes of Paul Veronese, and, like that great painter, can crowd, without over-crowding, the giant canvas on which he works.  We may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of impression which is Tourgenieff's chief charm, but once that we have mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the simplicity of an epic.  Dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals. He is not so fine an artist as Tourgenieff, for he deals more with the facts than with the effects of life; nor has he Tolstoi's largeness of vision and epic dignity; but he has qualities that are distinctively and absolutely his own, such as a fierce intensity of passion and concentration of impulse, a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries of psychology and the most hidden springs of life, and a realism that is pitiless in its fidelity, and terrible because it is true.  Some time ago we had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel _Crime and Punishment_, where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an assassin meet together to read the story of Dives and Lazarus, and the outcast girl leads the sinner to make atonement for his sin; nor is the book entitled _Injury and Insult_ at all inferior to that great masterpiece.  Mean and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may seem, the heroine Natasha is like one of the noble victims of Greek tragedy; she is Antigone with the passion of Ph?dra, and it is impossible to approach her without a feeling of awe.  Greek also is the gloom of Nemesis that hangs over each character, only it is a Nemesis that does not stand outside of life, but is part of our own nature and of the same material as life itself.  Ale'sha, the beautiful young lad whom Natasha follows to her doom, is a second Tito Melema, and has all Tito's charm and grace and fascination.  Yet he is different.  He would never have denied Baldassare in the Square at Florence, nor lied to Romola about Tessa.  He has a magnificent, momentary sincerity, a boyish unconsciousness of all that life signifies, an ardent enthusiasm for all that life cannot give.  There is nothing calculating about him.  He never thinks evil, he only does it.  From a psychological point of view he is one of the most interesting characters of modern fiction, as from an artistic he is one of the most attractive.  As we grow to know him he stirs strange questions for us, and makes us feel that it is not the wicked only who do wrong, nor the bad alone who work evil.  And by what a subtle objective method does Dostoieffski show us his characters!  He never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a description.  We grow to know them very gradually, as we know people whom we meet in society, at first by little tricks of manner, personal appearance, fancies in dress, and the like; and afterwards by their deeds and words; and even then they constantly elude us, for though Dostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature, yet he never explains his personages away; they are always surprising us by something that they say or do, and keep to the end the eternal mystery of life.  Irrespective of its value as a work of art, this novel possesses a deep autobiographical interest also, as the character of Vania, the poor student who loves Natasha through all her sin and shame, is Dostoieffski's study of himself.  Goethe once had to delay the completion of one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new situations, but almost before he had arrived at manhood Dostoieffski knew life in its most real forms; poverty and suffering, pain and misery, prison, exile, and love, were soon familiar to him, and by the lips of Vania he has told his own story.  This note of personal feeling, this harsh reality of actual experience, undoubtedly gives the book something of its strange fervour and terrible passion, yet it has not made it egotistic; we see things from every point of view, and we feel, not that fiction has been trammelled by fact, but that fact itself has become ideal and imaginative.  Pitiless, too, though Dostoieffski is in his method as an artist, as a man he is full of human pity for all, for those who do evil as well as for those who suffer it, for the selfish no less than for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is in vain.  Since _Adam Bede_ and _Le P?re Goriot_ no more powerful novel has been written than _Insult and Injury_.  To convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of those who are artists as well as thinkers in literature, and it is to a desire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we owe Mr. Pater's last volume.  For these Imaginary or, as we should prefer to call them, Imaginative Portraits of his, form a series of philosophic studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality, and the thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner, the very permanence of each principle gaining something through the change and colour of the life through which it finds expression.  The most fascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of Sebastian Van Storck.  The account of Watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful, and the description of him as one who was ?always a seeker after something in the world, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all,? seems to us more applicable to him who saw Mona Lisa sitting among the rocks than the gay and debonair _peintre des f?tes galantes_.  But Sebastian, the grave young Dutch philosopher, is charmingly drawn.  From the first glimpse we get of him, skating over the water-meadows with his plume of squirrel's tail and his fur muff, in all the modest pleasantness of boyhood, down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands of the Helder, we seem to see him, to know him, almost to hear the low music of his voice.  He is a dreamer, as the common phrase goes, and yet he is poetical in this sense, that his theorems shape life for him, directly.  Early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of Spinoza, and sets himself to realize the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness, separating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation, accident and even affection, till what is finite and relative becomes of no interest to him, and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his, so he himself is but a passing thought of God.  This conception, of the power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world, is exceedingly delightful, and Mr. Pater has never written a more subtle psychological study, the fact that Sebastian dies in an attempt to save the life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant pathos and sad irony.  _Denys l?Auxerrois_ is suggested by a figure found, or said to be found, on some old tapestries in Auxerre, the figure of a ?flaxen and flowery creature, sometimes well-nigh naked among the vine-leaves, sometimes muffled in skins against the cold, sometimes in the dress of a monk, but always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the veritable streets? of the town itself.  From this strange design Mr. Pater has fashioned a curious medi?val myth of the return of Dionysus among men, a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance, full of wonder and full of worship, Denys himself being half animal and half god, making the world mad with a new ecstasy of living, stirring the artists simply by his visible presence, drawing the marvel of music from reed and pipe, and slain at last in a stage-play by those who had loved him.  In its rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by Mantegna, and indeed Mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant in which Denys rides upon a gaily-painted chariot, in soft silken raiment and, for head-dress, a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks.  If _Denys l?Auxerrois_ symbolizes the passion of the senses and _Sebastian Van Storck_ the philosophic passion, as they certainly seem to do, though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the freedom and variety of the life that they portray, the passion for the imaginative world of art is the basis of the story of _Duke Carl of Rosenmold_.  Duke Carl is not unlike the late King of Bavaria, in his love of France, his admiration for the _Grand Monarque_ and his fantastic desire to amaze and to bewilder, but the resemblance is possibly only a chance one.  In fact Mr. Pater's young hero is the precursor of the _Aufkl?rung_ of the last century, the German precursor of Herder and Lessing and Goethe himself, and finds the forms of art ready to his hand without any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and responsive.  He too dies, trampled to death by the soldiers of the country he so much admired, on the night of his marriage with a peasant girl, the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace and dramatic interest.  On the whole, then, this is a singularly attractive book.  Mr. Pater is an intellectual impressionist.  He does not weary us with any definite doctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed.  He is always looking for exquisite moments and, when he has found them, he analyses them with delicate and delightful art and then passes on, often to the opposite pole of thought or feeling, knowing that every mood has its own quality and charm and is justified by its mere existence.  He has taken the sensationalism of Greek philosophy and made it a new method of art criticism.  As for his style, it is curiously ascetic.  Now and then, we come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression, as when he tells us how Denys l?Auxerrois, on his return from a long journey, ?ate flesh for the first time, tearing the hot, red morsels with his delicate fingers in a kind of wild greed,? but such passages are rare.  Asceticism is the keynote of Mr. Pater's prose; at times it is almost too severe in its self-control and makes us long for a little more freedom.  For indeed, the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become somewhat laborious.  Here and there, one is tempted to say of Mr. Pater that he is ?a seeker after something in language, that is there in no satisfying measure, or not at all.?  The continual preoccupation with phrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues.  And yet, when all is said, what wonderful prose it is, with its subtle preferences, its fastidious purity, its rejection of what is common or ordinary!  Mr. Pater has the true spirit of selection, the true art of omission.  If he be not among the greatest prose writers of our literature he is, at least, our greatest artist in prose; and though it may be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim, still in these latter days when violent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of nature, we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at perfection of form, that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means and sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty.  The Princess Christian's translation of the _Memoirs of Wilhelmine_, _Margravine of Baireuth_, is a most fascinating and delightful book.  The Margravine and her brother, Frederick the Great, were, as the Princess herself points out in an admirably written introduction, ?among the first of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom? in the last century.  ?They had studied,? says the Princess, ?the English philosophers, Newton, Locke, and Shaftesbury, and were roused to enthusiasm by the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau.  Their whole lives bore the impress of the influence of French thought on the burning questions of the day.  In the eighteenth century began that great struggle of philosophy against tyranny and worn-out abuses which culminated in the French Revolution.  The noblest minds were engaged in the struggle, and, like most reformers, they pushed their conclusions to extremes, and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in things.  The Margravine's influence on the intellectual development of her country is untold.  She formed at Baireuth a centre of culture and learning which had before been undreamt of in Germany.?  The historical value of these _Memoirs_ is, of course, well known. Carlyle speaks of them as being ?by far the best authority? on the early life of Frederick the Great.  But considered merely as the autobiography of a clever and charming woman, they are no less interesting, and even those who care nothing for eighteenth-century politics, and look upon history itself as an unattractive form of fiction, cannot fail to be fascinated by the Margravine's wit, vivacity and humour, by her keen powers of observation, and by her brilliant and assertive egotism.  Not that her life was by any means a happy one.  Her father, to quote the Princess Christian, ?ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with which he ruled his country, taking pleasure in making his power felt by all in the most galling manner,? and the Margravi|2
7|ne and her brother ?had much to suffer, not only from his ungovernable temper, but also from the real privations to which they were subjected.?  Indeed, the picture the Margravine gives of the King is quite extraordinary.  ?He despised all learning,? she writes, ?and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but needlework and household duties or details.  Had he found me writing or reading, he would probably have whipped me.?  He ?considered music a capital offence, and maintained that every one should devote himself to one object: men to the military service, and women to their household duties.  Science and the arts he counted among the 'seven deadly sins.?? Sometimes he took to religion, ?and then,? says the Margravine, ?we lived like trappists, to the great grief of my brother and myself.  Every afternoon the King preached a sermon, to which we had to listen as attentively as if it proceeded from an Apostle.  My brother and I were often seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst out laughing, upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads, which we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence.?  Economy and soldiers were his only topics of conversation; his chief social amusement was to make his guests intoxicated; and as for his temper, the accounts the Margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they were not amply corroborated from other sources.  Suetonius has written of the strange madness that comes on kings, but even in his melodramatic chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the Margravine has to tell us.  Here is one of her pictures of family life at a Royal Court in the last century, and it is not by any means the worst scene she describes:  Yet, as the Princess Christian remarks, ?despite the almost cruel treatment Wilhelmine received from her father, it is noticeable that throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection. She makes constant reference to his ?good heart??; and says that his faults ?were more those of temper than of nature.?  Nor could all the misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her intellect.  What would have made others morbid, made her satirical. Instead of weeping over her own personal tragedies, she laughs at the general comedy of life.  Here, for instance, is her description of Peter the Great and his wife, who arrived at Berlin in 1718:  Nor are the Margravine's descriptions of her reception as a bride in the principality of Baireuth less amusing.  Hof was the first town she came to, and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her.  This is her account of them:  As for Baireuth itself, and its petty Court, the picture she gives of it is exceedingly curious.  Her father-in-law, the reigning Margrave, was a narrow-minded mediocrity, whose conversation ?resembled that of a sermon read aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep,? and he had only two topics, Telemachus, and Amelot de la Houssaye's _Roman History_. The Ministers, from Baron von Stein, who always said ?yes? to everything, to Baron von Voit, who always said ?no,? were not by any means an intellectual set of men.  ?Their chief amusement,? says the Margravine, ?was drinking from morning till night,? and horses and cattle were all they talked about.  The palace itself was shabby, decayed and dirty.  ?I was like a lamb among wolves,? cries the poor Margravine; ?I was settled in a strange country, at a Court which more resembled a peasant's farm, surrounded by coarse, bad, dangerous, and tiresome people.?  Yet her _esprit_ never deserted her.  She is always clever, witty, and entertaining.  Her stories about the endless squabbles over precedence are extremely amusing.  The society of her day cared very little for good manners, knew, indeed, very little about them, but all questions of etiquette were of vital importance, and the Margravine herself, though she saw the shallowness of the whole system, was far too proud not to assert her rights when circumstances demanded it, as the description she gives of her visit to the Empress of Germany shows very clearly.  When this meeting was first proposed, the Margravine declined positively to entertain the idea.  ?There was no precedent,? she writes, ?of a King's daughter and the Empress having met, and I did not know to what rights I ought to lay claim.?  Finally, however, she is induced to consent, but she lays down three conditions for her reception:   Many other extracts might be given from this delightful book, but from the few that have been selected some idea can be formed of the vivacity and picturesqueness of the Margravine's style.  As for her character, it is very well summed up by the Princess Christian, who, while admitting that she often appears almost heartless and inconsiderate, yet claims that, ?taken as a whole, she stands out in marked prominence among the most gifted women of the eighteenth century, not only by her mental powers, but by her goodness of heart, her self-sacrificing devotion, and true friendship.?  An interesting sequel to her _Memoirs_ would be her correspondence with Voltaire, and it is to be hoped that we may shortly see a translation of these letters from the same accomplished pen to which we owe the present volume. {63}  One of the most powerful and pathetic novels that has recently appeared is _A Village Tragedy_ by Margaret L. Woods.  To find any parallel to this lurid little story, one must go to Dostoieffski or to Guy de Maupassant.  Not that Mrs. Woods can be said to have taken either of these two great masters of fiction as her model, but there is something in her work that recalls their method; she has not a little of their fierce intensity, their terrible concentration, their passionless yet poignant objectivity; like them, she seems to allow life to suggest its own mode of presentation; and, like them, she recognizes that a frank acceptance of the facts of life is the true basis of all modern imitative art.  The scene of Mrs. Woods's story lies in one of the villages near Oxford; the characters are very few in number, and the plot is extremely simple.  It is a romance of modern Arcadia?a tale of the love of a farm-labourer for a girl who, though slightly above him in social station and education, is yet herself also a servant on a farm.  True Arcadians they are, both of them, and their ignorance and isolation serve only to intensify the tragedy that gives the story its title.  It is the fashion nowadays to label literature, so, no doubt, Mrs. Woods's novel will be spoken of as ?realistic.?  Its realism, however, is the realism of the artist, not of the reporter; its tact of treatment, subtlety of perception, and fine distinction of style, make it rather a poem than a _proc's-verbal_; and though it lays bare to us the mere misery of life, it suggests something of life's mystery also.  Very delicate, too, is the handling of external Nature.  There are no formal guide-book descriptions of scenery, nor anything of what Byron petulantly called ?twaddling about trees,? but we seem to breathe the atmosphere of the country, to catch the exquisite scent of the beanfields, so familiar to all who have ever wandered through the Oxfordshire lanes in June; to hear the birds singing in the thicket, and the sheep-bells tinkling from the hill.  Characterization, that enemy of literary form, is such an essential part of the method of the modern writer of fiction, that Nature has almost become to the novelist what light and shade are to the painter?the one permanent element of style; and if the power of _A Village Tragedy_ be due to its portrayal of human life, no small portion of its charm comes from its Theocritean setting.  Mr. Morris's second volume brings the great romantic epic of Greek literature to its perfect conclusion, and although there can never be an ultimate translation of either _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_, as each successive age is sure to find pleasure in rendering the two poems in its own manner and according to its own canons of taste, still it is not too much to say that Mr. Morris's version will always be a true classic amongst our classical translations.  It is not, of course, flawless.  In our notice of the first volume we ventured to say that Mr. Morris was sometimes far more Norse than Greek, nor does the volume that now lies before us make us alter that opinion.  The particular metre, also, selected by Mr. Morris, although admirably adapted to express ?the strong-winged music of Homer,? as far as its flow and freedom are concerned, misses something of its dignity and calm.  Here, it must be admitted, we feel a distinct loss, for there is in Homer not a little of Milton's lofty manner, and if swiftness be an essential of the Greek hexameter, stateliness is one of its distinguishing qualities in Homer's hands.  This defect, however, if we must call it a defect, seems almost unavoidable, as for certain metrical reasons a majestic movement in English verse is necessarily a slow movement; and, after all that can be said is said, how really admirable is this whole translation!  If we set aside its noble qualities as a poem and look on it purely from the scholar's point of view, how straightforward it is, how honest and direct!  Its fidelity to the original is far beyond that of any other verse-translation in our literature, and yet it is not the fidelity of a pedant to his text but rather the fine loyalty of poet to poet.  When Mr. Morris's first volume appeared many of the critics complained that his occasional use of archaic words and unusual expressions robbed his version of the true Homeric simplicity.  This, however, is not a very felicitous criticism, for while Homer is undoubtedly simple in his clearness and largeness of vision, his wonderful power of direct narration, his wholesome sanity, and the purity and precision of his method, simple in language he undoubtedly is not.  What he was to his contemporaries we have, of course, no means of judging, but we know that the Athenian of the fifth century B.C. found him in many places difficult to understand, and when the creative age was succeeded by the age of criticism and Alexandria began to take the place of Athens as the centre of culture for the Hellenistic world, Homeric dictionaries and glossaries seem to have been constantly published.  Indeed, Athen?us tells us of a wonderful Byzantine blue-stocking, a _pr?cieuse_ from the Propontis, who wrote a long hexameter poem, called _Mnemosyne_, full of ingenious commentaries on difficulties in Homer, and in fact, it is evident that, as far as the language is concerned, such a phrase as ?Homeric simplicity? would have rather amazed an ancient Greek.  As for Mr. Morris's tendency to emphasize the etymological meaning of words, a point commented on with somewhat flippant severity in a recent number of _Macmillan_?_s Magazine_, here Mr. Morris seems to us to be in complete accord, not merely with the spirit of Homer, but with the spirit of all early poetry.  It is quite true that language is apt to degenerate into a system of almost algebraic symbols, and the modern city-man who takes a ticket for Blackfriars Bridge, naturally never thinks of the Dominican monks who once had their monastery by Thames-side, and after whom the spot is named.  But in earlier times it was not so.  Men were then keenly conscious of the real meaning of words, and early poetry, especially, is full of this feeling, and, indeed, may be said to owe to it no small portion of its poetic power and charm.  These old words, then, and this old use of words which we find in Mr. Morris's _Odyssey_ can be amply justified upon historical grounds, and as for their artistic effect, it is quite excellent.  Pope tried to put Homer into the ordinary language of his day, with what result we know only too well; but Mr. Morris, who uses his archaisms with the tact of a true artist, and to whom indeed they seem to come absolutely naturally, has succeeded in giving to his version by their aid that touch, not of ?quaintness,? for Homer is never quaint, but of old-world romance and old-world beauty, which we moderns find so pleasurable, and to which the Greeks themselves were so keenly sensitive.  As for individual passages of special merit, Mr. Morris's translation is no robe of rags sewn with purple patches for critics to sample.  Its real value lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole, in the grand architecture of the swift, strong verse, and in the fact that the standard is not merely high but everywhere sustained.  It is impossible, however, to resist the temptation of quoting Mr. Morris's rendering of that famous passage in the twenty-third book of the epic, in which Odysseus eludes the trap laid for him by Penelope, whose very faith in the certainty of her husband's return makes her sceptical of his identity when he stands before her; an instance, by the way, of Homer's wonderful psychological knowledge of human nature, as it is always the dreamer himself who is most surprised when his dream comes true.  These last twelve books of the _Odyssey_ have not the same marvel of romance, adventure and colour that we find in the earlier part of the epic.  There is nothing in them that we can compare to the exquisite idyll of Nausicaa or to the Titanic humour of the episode in the Cyclops? cave.  Penelope has not the glamour of Circe, and the song of the Sirens may sound sweeter than the whizz of the arrows of Odysseus as he stands on the threshold of his hall.  Yet, for sheer intensity of passionate power, for concentration of intellectual interest and for masterly dramatic construction, these latter books are quite unequalled.  Indeed, they show very clearly how it was that, as Greek art developed, the epos passed into the drama.  The whole scheme of the argument, the return of the hero in disguise, his disclosure of himself to his son, his terrible vengeance on his enemies and his final recognition by his wife, reminds us of the plot of more than one Greek play, and shows us what the great Athenian poet meant when he said that his own dramas were merely scraps from Homer's table.  In rendering this splendid poem into English verse, Mr. Morris has done our literature a service that can hardly be over-estimated, and it is pleasant to think that, even should the classics be entirely excluded from our educational systems, the English boy will still be able to know something of Homer's delightful tales, to catch an echo of his grand music and to wander with the wise Odysseus round ?the shores of old romance.?  Phyllis Browne's Life of Mrs. Somerville forms part of a very interesting little series, called ?The World's Workers??a collection of short biographies catholic enough to include personalities so widely different as Turner and Richard Cobden, Handel and Sir Titus Salt, Robert Stephenson and Florence Nightingale, and yet possessing a certain definite aim.  As a mathematician and a scientist, the translator and popularizer of _La M?canique C?leste_, and the author of an important book on physical geography, Mrs. Somerville is, of course, well known. The scientific bodies of Europe covered her with honours; her bust stands in the hall of the Royal Society, and one of the Women's Colleges at Oxford bears her name.  Yet, considered simply in the light of a wife and a mother, she is no less admirable; and those who consider that stupidity is the proper basis for the domestic virtues, and that intellectual women must of necessity be helpless with their hands, cannot do better than read Phyllis Browne's pleasant little book, in which they will find that the greatest woman-mathematician of any age was a clever needlewoman, a good housekeeper, and a most skilful cook.  Indeed, Mrs. Somerville seems to have been quite renowned for her cookery.  The discoverers of the North-West Passage christened an island ?Somerville,? not as a tribute to the distinguished mathematician, but as a recognition of the excellence of some orange marmalade which the distinguished mathematician had prepared with her own hands and presented to the ships before they left England; and to the fact that she was able to make currant jelly at a very critical moment she owed the affection of some of her husband's relatives, who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against her on the ground that she was merely an unpractical Blue-stocking.  Nor did her scientific knowledge ever warp or dull the tenderness and humanity of her nature.  For birds and animals she had always a great love.  We hear of her as a little girl watching with eager eyes the swallows as they built their nests in summer or prepared for their flight in the autumn; and when snow was on the ground she used to open the windows to let the robins hop in and pick crumbs on the breakfast-table. On one occasion she went with her father on a tour in the Highlands, and found on her return that a pet goldfinch, which had been left in the charge of the servants, had been neglected by them and had died of starvation.  She was almost heart-broken at the event, and in writing her _Recollections_, seventy years after, she mentioned it and said that, as she wrote, she felt deep pain.  Her chief pet in her old age was a mountain sparrow, which used to perch on her arm and go to sleep there while she was writing.  One day the sparrow fell into the water-jug and was drowned, to the great grief of its mistress who could hardly be consoled for its loss, though later on we hear of a beautiful paroquet taking the place of _le moineau d?Uranie_, and becoming Mrs. Somerville's constant companion.  She was also very energetic, Phyllis Browne tells us, in trying to get a law passed in the Italian Parliament for the protection of animals, and said once, with reference to this subject, ?We English cannot boast of humanity so long as our sportsmen find pleasure in shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified out of a cage??a remark with which I entirely agree.  Mr. Herbert's Bill for the protection of land birds gave her immense pleasure, though, to quote her own words, she was ?grieved to find that ?the lark, which at heaven's gate sings,? is thought unworthy of man's protection?; and she took a great fancy to a gentleman who, on being told of the number of singing birds that is eaten in Italy?nightingales, goldfinches, and robins?exclaimed in horror, ?What! robins! our household birds!  I would as soon eat a child!?  Indeed, she believed to some extent in the immortality of animals on the ground that, if animals have no future, it would seem as if some were created for uncompensated misery?an idea which does not seem to me to be either extravagant or fantastic, though it must be admitted that the optimism on which it is based receives absolutely no support from science.  On the whole, Phyllis Browne's book is very pleasant reading.  Its only fault is that it is far too short, and this is a fault so rare in modern literature that it almost amounts to a distinction.  However, Phyllis Browne has managed to crowd into the narrow limits at her disposal a great many interesting anecdotes.  The picture she gives of Mrs. Somerville working away at her translation of Laplace in the same room with her children is very charming, and reminds one of what is told of George Sand; there is an amusing account of Mrs. Somerville's visit to the widow of the young Pretender, the Countess of Albany, who, after talking with her for some time, exclaimed, ?So you don?t speak Italian. You must have had a very bad education?!  And this story about the Waverley Novels may possibly be new to some of my readers:  Phyllis Browne remarks that this incident shows ?that persons who want to keep a secret ought to be very careful when children are about?; but the story seems to me to be far too charming to require any moral of the kind.  Bound up in the same volume is a Life of Miss Mary Carpenter, also written by Phyllis Browne.  Miss Carpenter does not seem to me to have the charm and fascination of Mrs. Somerville.  There is always something about her that is formal, limited, and precise.  When she was about two years old she insisted on being called ?Doctor Carpenter? in the nursery; at the age of twelve she is described by a friend as a sedate little girl, who always spoke like a book; and before she entered on her educational schemes she wrote down a solemn dedication of herself to the service of humanity.  However, she was one of the practical, hardworking saints of the nineteenth century, and it is no doubt quite right that the saints should take themselves very seriously.  It is only fair also to remember that her work of rescue and reformation was carried on under great difficulties.  Here, for instance, is the picture Miss Cobbe gives us of one of the Bristol night-schools:  Her own account is somewhat pleasanter, and shows that ?the troop of bisons in hob-nailed shoes? was not always so barbarous.  A boy defined conscience as ?a thing a gentleman hasn?t got, who, when a boy finds his purse and gives it back to him, doesn?t give the boy sixpence.?  Another boy was asked, after a Sunday evening lecture on ?Thankfulness,? what pleasure he enjoyed most in the course of a year.  He replied candidly, ?Cock-fightin?, ma?am; there's a pit up by the ?Black Boy? as is worth anythink in Brissel.?  There is something a little pathetic in the attempt to civilize the rough street-boy by means of the refining influence of ferns and fossils, and it is difficult to help feeling that Miss Carpenter rather over-estimated the value of elementary education.  The poor are not to be fed upon facts.  Even Shakespeare and the Pyramids are not sufficient; nor is there much use in giving them the results of culture, unless we also give them those conditions under which culture can be realized.  In these cold, crowded cities of the North, the proper basis for morals, using the word in its wide Hellenic signification, is to be found in architecture, not in books.  Still, it would be ungenerous not to recognize that Mary Carpenter gave to the children of the poor not merely her learning, but her love.  In early life, her biographer tells us, she had longed for the happiness of being a wife and a mother; but later she became content that her affection could be freely given to all who needed it, and the verse in the prophecies, ?I have given thee children whom thou hast not borne,? seemed to her to indicate what was to be her true mission.  Indeed, she rather inclined to Bacon's opinion, that unmarried people do the best public work.  ?It is quite striking,? she says in one of her letters, ?to observe how much the useful power and influence of woman has developed of late years.  Unattached ladies, such as widows and unmarried women, have quite ample work to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all their powers.  Wives and mothers have a very noble work given them by God, and want no more.?  The whole passage is extremely interesting, and the phrase ?unattached ladies? is quite delightful, and reminds one of Charles Lamb.  In society, says Mr. Mahaffy, every civilized man and woman ought to feel it their duty to say something, even when there is hardly anything to be said, and, in order to encourage this delightful art of brilliant chatter, he has published a social guide without which no _d?butante_ or dandy should ever dream of going out to dine.  Not that Mr. Mahaffy's book can be said to be, in any sense of the word, popular.  In discussing this important subject of conversation, he has not merely followed the scientific method of Aristotle which is, perhaps, excusable, but he has adopted the literary style of Aristotle for which no excuse is possible. There is, also, hardly a single anecdote, hardly a single illustration, and the reader is left to put the Professor's abstract rules into practice, without either the examples or the warnings of history to encourage or to dissuade him in his reckless career.  Still, the book can be warmly recommended to all who propose to substitute the vice of verbosity for the stupidity of silence.  It fascinates in spite of its form and pleases in spite of its pedantry, and is the nearest approach, that we know of, in modern literature to meeting Aristotle at an afternoon tea.  As regards physical conditions, the only one that is considered by Mr. Mahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good conversationalist, is the possession of a musical voice.  Some learned writers have been of opinion that a slight stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation, but Mr. Mahaffy rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity from a native brogue to an artificial catchword.  With his remarks on the latter point, the meaningless repetition of phrases, we entirely agree. Nothing can be more irritating than the scientific person who is always saying ?_Exactly so_,? or the commonplace person who ends every sentence with ?_Don?t you know_?? or the pseudo-artistic person who murmurs ?_Charming_, _charming_,? on the smallest-provocation.  It is, however, with the mental and moral qualifications for conversation that Mr. Mahaffy specially deals.  Knowledge he, naturally, regards as an absolute essential, for, as he most justly observes, ?an ignorant man is seldom agreeable, except as a butt.?  Upon the other hand, strict accuracy should be avoided.  ?Even a consummate liar,? says Mr. Mahaffy, is a better ingredient in a company than ?the scrupulously truthful man, who weighs every statement, questions every fact, and corrects every inaccuracy.?  The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation, not instruction, is the aim of conversation, and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company.  Mr. Mahaffy, however, makes an exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells us that intelligent questions addressed to an astronomer, or a pure mathematician, will elicit many curious facts which will pleasantly beguile the time.  Here, in the interest of Society, we feel bound to enter a formal protest.  Nobody, even in the provinces, should ever be allowed to ask an intelligent question about pure mathematics across a dinner-table.  A question of this kind is quite as bad as inquiring suddenly about the state of a man's soul, a sort of _coup_ which, as Mr. Mahaffy remarks elsewhere, ?many pious people have actually thought a decent introduction to a conversation.?  As for the moral qualifications of a good talker, Mr. Mahaffy, following the example of his great master, warns us against any disproportionate excess of virtue.  Modesty, for instance, may easily become a social vice, and to be continually apologizing for one's ignorance or stupidity is a grave injury to conversation, for, ?what we want to learn from each member is his free opinion on the subject in hand, not his own estimate of the value of that opinion.?  Simplicity, too, is not without its dangers.  The _enfant terrible_, with his shameless love of truth, the raw country-bred girl who always says what she means, and the plain, blunt man who makes a point of speaking his mind on every possible occasion, without ever considering whether he has a mind at all, are the fatal examples of what simplicity leads to.  Shyness may be a form of vanity, and reserve a development of pride, and as for sympathy, what can be more detestable than the man, or woman, who insists on agreeing with everybody, and so makes ?a discussion, which implies differences in opinion,? absolutely impossible?  Even the unselfish listener is apt to become a bore.  ?These silent people,? says Mr. Mahaffy, ?not only take all they can get in Society for nothing, but they take it without the smallest gratitude, and have the audacity afterwards to censure those who have laboured for their amusement.?  Tact, which is an exquisite sense of the symmetry of things, is, according to Mr. Mahaffy, the highest and best of all the moral conditions for conversation.  The man of tact, he most wisely remarks, ?will instinctively avoid jokes about Blue Beard? in the company of a woman who is a man's third wife; he will never be guilty of talking like a book, but will rather avoid too careful an attention to grammar and the rounding of periods; he will cultivate the art of graceful interruption, so as to prevent a subjec|2
8|t being worn threadbare by the aged or the inexperienced; and should he be desirous of telling a story, he will look round and consider each member of the party, and if there be a single stranger present will forgo the pleasure of anecdotage rather than make the social mistake of hurting even one of the guests. As for prepared or premeditated art, Mr. Mahaffy has a great contempt for it and tells us of a certain college don (let us hope not at Oxford or Cambridge) who always carried a jest-book in his pocket and had to refer to it when he wished to make a repartee.  Great wits, too, are often very cruel, and great humorists often very vulgar, so it will be better to try and ?make good conversation without any large help from these brilliant but dangerous gifts.?  In a _t?te-?-t?te_ one should talk about persons, and in general Society about things.  The state of the weather is always an excusable exordium, but it is convenient to have a paradox or heresy on the subject always ready so as to direct the conversation into other channels.  Really domestic people are almost invariably bad talkers as their very virtues in home life have dulled their interest in outer things.  The very best mothers will insist on chattering of their babies and prattling about infant education.  In fact, most women do not take sufficient interest in politics, just as most men are deficient in general reading.  Still, anybody can be made to talk, except the very obstinate, and even a commercial traveller may be drawn out and become quite interesting.  As for Society small talk, it is impossible, Mr. Mahaffy tells us, for any sound theory of conversation to depreciate gossip, ?which is perhaps the main factor in agreeable talk throughout Society.?  The retailing of small personal points about great people always gives pleasure, and if one is not fortunate enough to be an Arctic traveller or an escaped Nihilist, the best thing one can do is to relate some anecdote of ?Prince Bismarck, or King Victor Emmanuel, or Mr. Gladstone.?  In the case of meeting a genius and a Duke at dinner, the good talker will try to raise himself to the level of the former and to bring the latter down to his own level.  To succeed among one's social superiors one must have no hesitation in contradicting them.  Indeed, one should make bold criticisms and introduce a bright and free tone into a Society whose grandeur and extreme respectability make it, Mr. Mahaffy remarks, as pathetically as inaccurately, ?perhaps somewhat dull.?  The best conversationalists are those whose ancestors have been bilingual, like the French and Irish, but the art of conversation is really within the reach of almost every one, except those who are morbidly truthful, or whose high moral worth requires to be sustained by a permanent gravity of demeanour and a general dullness of mind.  These are the broad principles contained in Mr. Mahaffy's clever little book, and many of them will, no doubt, commend themselves to our readers. The maxim, ?If you find the company dull, blame yourself,? seems to us somewhat optimistic, and we have no sympathy at all with the professional storyteller who is really a great bore at a dinner-table; but Mr. Mahaffy is quite right in insisting that no bright social intercourse is possible without equality, and it is no objection to his book to say that it will not teach people how to talk cleverly.  It is not logic that makes men reasonable, nor the science of ethics that makes men good, but it is always useful to analyse, to formularize and to investigate.  The only thing to be regretted in the volume is the arid and jejune character of the style.  If Mr. Mahaffy would only write as he talks, his book would be much pleasanter reading.  The want of a good series of popular handbooks on Irish art has long been felt, the works of Sir William Wilde, Petrie and others being somewhat too elaborate for the ordinary student; so we are glad to notice the appearance, under the auspicesof the Committee of Council on Education, of Miss Margaret Stokes's useful little volume on the early Christian art of her country.  There is, of course, nothing particularly original in Miss Stokes's book, nor can she be said to be a very attractive or pleasing writer, but it is unfair to look for originality in primers, and the charm of the illustrations fully atones for the somewhat heavy and pedantic character of the style.  This early Christian art of Ireland is full of interest to the artist, the arch?ologist and the historian.  In its rudest forms, such as the little iron hand-bell, the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden staff, it brings us back to the simplicity of the primitive Christian Church, while to the period of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of Celtic metal-work.  The stone chalice is now replaced by the chalice of silver and gold; the iron bell has its jewel-studded shrine, and the rough staff its gorgeous casing; rich caskets and splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the Saints and, instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries, we have such beautiful works of art as the processional cross of Cong Abbey. Beautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of ornamentation, its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere workmanship, nor is there any doubt about its history.  From the inscriptions on it, which are corroborated by the annals of Innisfallen and the book of Clonmacnoise, we learn that it was made for King Turlough O?Connor by a native artist under the superintendence of Bishop O?Duffy, its primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in 1123.  Brought to Cong some years afterwards, probably by the archbishop, who died there in 1150, it was concealed at the time of the Reformation, but at the beginning of the present century was still in the possession of the last abbot, and at his death it was purchased by Professor MacCullagh and presented by him to the museum of the Royal Irish Academy.  This wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to Dublin, but not less lovely is the chalice of Ardagh, a two-handled silver cup, absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form, and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of _cloisonn?_ and _champlev?_ enamel.  There is no mention of this cup, or of the so-called Tara brooch, in ancient Irish history.  All that we know of them is that they were found accidentally, the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near the old Rath of Ardagh, the latter by a poor child who picked it up near the seashore.  They both, however, belong probably to the tenth century.  Of all these works, as well as of the bell shrines, book-covers, sculptured crosses and illuminated designs in manuscripts, excellent pictures are given in Miss Stokes's handbook.  The extremely interesting _Fiachal Phadrig_, or shrine of St. Patrick's tooth, might have been figured and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament, and one of the old miniatures of the scribe or Evangelist writing would have given an additional interest to the chapter on Irish MSS.  On the whole, however, the book is wonderfully well illustrated, and the ordinary art student will be able to get some useful suggestions from it. Indeed, Miss Stokes, echoing the aspirations of many of the great Irish arch?ologists, looks forward to the revival of a native Irish school in architecture, sculpture, metal-work and painting.  Such an aspiration is, of course, very laudable, but there is always a danger of these revivals being merely artificial reproductions, and it may be questioned whether the peculiar forms of Irish ornamentation could be made at all expressive of the modern spirit.  A recent writer on house decoration has gravely suggested that the British householder should take his meals in a Celtic dining-room adorned with a dado of Ogham inscriptions, and such wicked proposals may serve as a warning to all who fancy that the reproduction of a form necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form life and meaning, and who fail to recognize the difference between art and anachronisms.  Miss Stokes's proposal for an ark-shaped church in which the mural painter is to repeat the arcades and ?follow the architectural compositions of the grand pages of the Eusebian canons in the Book of Kells,? has, of course, nothing grotesque about it, but it is not probable that the artistic genius of the Irish people will, even when ?the land has rest,? find in such interesting imitations its healthiest or best expression.  Still, there are certain elements of beauty in ancient Irish art that the modern artist would do well to study.  The value of the intricate illuminations in the Book of Kells, as far as their adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes, has been very much overrated, but in the ancient Irish torques, brooches, pins, clasps and the like, the modern goldsmith will find a rich and, comparatively speaking, an untouched field; and now that the Celtic spirit has become the leaven of our politics, there is no reason why it should not contribute something to our decorative art.  This result, however, will not be obtained by a patriotic misuse of old designs, and even the most enthusiastic Home Ruler must not be allowed to decorate his dining-room with a dado of Oghams.  Madame Ristori's _Etudes et Souvenirs_ is one of the most delightful books on the stage that has appeared since Lady Martin's charming volume on the Shakespearian heroines.  It is often said that actors leave nothing behind them but a barren name and a withered wreath; that they subsist simply upon the applause of the moment; that they are ultimately doomed to the oblivion of old play-bills; and that their art, in a word, dies with them, and shares their own mortality.  ?Chippendale, the cabinet-maker,? says the clever author of _Obiter Dicta_, ?is more potent than Garrick the actor.  The vivacity of the latter no longer charms (save in Boswell); the chairs of the former still render rest impossible in a hundred homes.?  This view, however, seems to me to be exaggerated. It rests on the assumption that acting is simply a mimetic art, and takes no account of its imaginative and intellectual basis.  It is quite true, of course, that the personality of the player passes away, and with it that pleasure-giving power by virtue of which the arts exist.  Yet the artistic method of a great actor survives.  It lives on in tradition, and becomes part of the science of a school.  It has all the intellectual life of a principle.  In England, at the present moment, the influence of Garrick on our actors is far stronger than that of Reynolds on our painters of portraits, and if we turn to France it is easy to discern the tradition of Talma, but where is the tradition of David?  Madame Ristori's memoirs, then, have not merely the charm that always attaches to the autobiography of a brilliant and beautiful woman, but have also a definite and distinct artistic value.  Her analysis of the character of Lady Macbeth, for instance, is full of psychological interest, and shows us that the subtleties of Shakespearian criticism are not necessarily confined to those who have views on weak endings and rhyming tags, but may also be suggested by the art of acting itself.  The author of _Obiter Dicta_ seeks to deny to actors all critical insight and all literary appreciation.  The actor, he tells us, is art's slave, not her child, and lives entirely outside literature, ?with its words for ever on his lips, and none of its truths engraven on his heart.?  But this seems to me to be a harsh and reckless generalization.  Indeed, so far from agreeing with it, I would be inclined to say that the mere artistic process of acting, the translation of literature back again into life, and the presentation of thought under the conditions of action, is in itself a critical method of a very high order; nor do I think that a study of the careers of our great English actors will really sustain the charge of want of literary appreciation.  It may be true that actors pass too quickly away from the form, in order to get at the feeling that gives the form beauty and colour, and that, where the literary critic studies the language, the actor looks simply for the life; and yet, how well the great actors have appreciated that marvellous music of words, which in Shakespeare, at any rate, is so vital an element of poetic power, if, indeed, it be not equally so in the case of all who have any claim to be regarded as true poets.  ?The sensual life of verse,? says Keats, in a dramatic criticism published in the _Champion_, 'springs warm from the lips of Kean, and to one learned in Shakespearian hieroglyphics, learned in the spiritual portion of those lines to which Kean adds a sensual grandeur, his tongue must seem to have robbed the Hybla bees and left them honeyless.?  This particular feeling, of which Keats speaks, is familiar to all who have heard Salvini, Sarah Bernhardt, Ristori, or any of the great artists of our day, and it is a feeling that one cannot, I think, gain merely by reading the passage to oneself.  For my own part, I must confess that it was not until I heard Sarah Bernhardt in _Ph?dre_ that I absolutely realized the sweetness of the music of Racine.  As for Mr. Birrell's statement that actors have the words of literature for ever on their lips, but none of its truths engraved on their hearts, all that one can say is that, if it be true, it is a defect which actors share with the majority of literary critics.  The account Madame Ristori gives of her own struggles, voyages and adventures, is very pleasant reading indeed.  The child of poor actors, she made her first appearance when she was three months old, being brought on in a hamper as a New Year's gift to a selfish old gentleman who would not forgive his daughter for having married for love.  As, however, she began to cry long before the hamper was opened, the comedy became a farce, to the immense amusement of the public.  She next appeared in a medi?val melodrama, being then three years of age, and was so terrified at the machinations of the villain that she ran away at the most critical moment.  However, her stage-fright seems to have disappeared, and we find her playing Silvio Pellico's _Francesca da Rimini_ at fifteen, and at eighteen making her _d?but_ as Marie Stuart. At this time the naturalism of the French method was gradually displacing the artificial elocution and academic poses of the Italian school of acting.  Madame Ristori seems to have tried to combine simplicity with style, and the passion of nature with the self-restraint of the artist. ?J?ai voulu fondre les deux mani?res,? she tells us, ?car je sentais que toutes choses ?tant susceptibles de progr's, l?art dramatique aussi ?tait appel? ? subir des transformations.?  The natural development, however, of the Italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous censorship of plays then existing in each town under Austrian or Papal rule.  The slightest allusion to the sentiment of nationality or the spirit of freedom was prohibited.  Even the word _patria_ was regarded as treasonable, and Madame Ristori tells us an amusing story of the indignation of a censor who was asked to license a play, in which a dumb man returns home after an absence of many years, and on his entrance upon the stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native land once more.  ?Gestures of this kind,? said the censor, ?are obviously of a very revolutionary tendency, and cannot possibly be allowed.  The only gestures that I could think of permitting would be gestures expressive of a dumb man's delight in scenery generally.?  The stage directions were accordingly altered, and the word ?landscape? substituted for ?native land?!  Another censor was extremely severe on an unfortunate poet who had used the expression ?the beautiful Italian sky,? and explained to him that ?the beautiful Lombardo-Venetian sky? was the proper official expression to use.  Poor Gregory in _Romeo and Juliet_ had to be rechristened, because Gregory is a name dear to the Popes; and the  of the first witch in _Macbeth_ was ruthlessly struck out as containing an obvious allusion to the steersman of St. Peter's bark.  Finally, bored and bothered by the political and theological Dogberrys of the day, with their inane prejudices, their solemn stupidity, and their entire ignorance of the conditions necessary for the growth of sane and healthy art, Madame Ristori made up her mind to leave the stage.  She, however, was extremely anxious to appear once before a Parisian audience, Paris being at that time the centre of dramatic activity, and after some consideration left Italy for France in the year 1855.  There she seems to have been a great success, particularly in the part of Myrrha; classical without being cold, artistic without being academic, she brought to the interpretation of the character of Alfieri's great heroine the colour-element of passion, the form-element of style.  Jules Janin was loud in his praises, the Emperor begged Ristori to join the troupe of the Com?die Fran?aise, and Rachel, with the strange narrow jealousy of her nature, trembled for her laurels.  Myrrha was followed by Marie Stuart, and Marie Stuart by Medea.  In the latter part Madame Ristori excited the greatest enthusiasm.  Ary Scheffer designed her costumes for her; and the Niobe that stands in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, suggested to Madame Ristori her famous pose in the scene with the children.  She would not consent, however, to remain in France, and we find her subsequently playing in almost every country in the world from Egypt to Mexico, from Denmark to Honolulu.  Her representations of classical plays seem to have been always immensely admired.  When she played at Athens, the King offered to arrange for a performance in the beautiful old theatre of Dionysos, and during her tour in Portugal she produced _Medea_ before the University of Coimbra.  Her description of the latter engagement is extremely interesting.  On her arrival at the University, she was received by the entire body of the undergraduates, who still wear a costume almost medi?val in character.  Some of them came on the stage in the course of the play as the handmaidens of Creusa, hiding their black beards beneath heavy veils, and as soon as they had finished their parts they took their places gravely among the audience, to Madame Ristori's horror, still in their Greek dress, but with their veils thrown back and smoking long cigars.  ?Ce n?est pas la premi?re fois,? she says, ?que j?ai d? emp?cher, par un effort de volont?, la trag?die de se terminer en farce.?  Very interesting, also, is her account of the production of Montanelli's _Camma_, and she tells an amusing story of the arrest of the author by the French police on the charge of murder, in consequence of a telegram she sent to him in which the words ?body of the victim? occurred.  Indeed, the whole book is full of cleverly written stories, and admirable criticisms on dramatic art.  I have quoted from the French version, which happens to be the one that lies before me, but whether in French or Italian the book is one of the most fascinating autobiographies that has appeared for some time, even in an age like ours when literary egotism has been brought to such an exquisite pitch of perfection.  England has given to the world one great poetess, Elizabeth Barrett Browning.  By her side Mr. Swinburne would place Miss Christina Rossetti, whose New Year hymn he describes as so much the noblest of sacred poems in our language, that there is none which comes near it enough to stand second.  ?It is a hymn,? he tells us, ?touched as with the fire, and bathed as in the light of sunbeams, tuned as to chords and cadences of refluent sea-music beyond reach of harp and organ, large echoes of the serene and sonorous tides of heaven.?  Much as I admire Miss Rossetti's work, her subtle choice of words, her rich imagery, her artistic na?vet?, wherein curious notes of strangeness and simplicity are fantastically blended together, I cannot but think that Mr. Swinburne has, with noble and natural loyalty, placed her on too lofty a pedestal.  To me, she is simply a very delightful artist in poetry.  This is indeed something so rare that when we meet it we cannot fail to love it, but it is not everything.  Beyond it and above it are higher and more sunlit heights of song, a larger vision, and an ampler air, a music at once more passionate and more profound, a creative energy that is born of the spirit, a winged rapture that is born of the soul, a force and fervour of mere utterance that has all the wonder of the prophet, and not a little of the consecration of the priest.  Mrs. Browning is unapproachable by any woman who has ever touched lyre or blown through reed since the days of the great ?olian poetess.  But Sappho, who to the antique world was a pillar of flame, is to us but a pillar of shadow.  Of her poems, burnt with other most precious work by Byzantine Emperor and by Roman Pope, only a few fragments remain. Possibly they lie mouldering in the scented darkness of an Egyptian tomb, clasped in the withered hand of some long-dead lover.  Some Greek monk at Athos may even now be poring over an ancient manuscript, whose crabbed characters conceal lyric or ode by her whom the Greeks spoke of as ?the Poetess? just as they termed Homer ?the Poet,? who was to them the tenth Muse, the flower of the Graces, the child of Er's, and the pride of Hellas?Sappho, with the sweet voice, the bright, beautiful eyes, the dark hyacinth coloured hair.  But, practically, the work of the marvellous singer of Lesbos is entirely lost to us.  We have a few rose-leaves out of her garden, that is all.  Literature nowadays survives marble and bronze, but in the old days, in spite of the Roman poet's noble boast, it was not so.  The fragile clay vases of the Greeks still keep for us pictures of Sappho, delicately painted in black and red and white; but of her song we have only the echo of an echo.  Of all the women of history, Mrs. Browning is the only one that we could name in any possible or remote conjunction with Sappho.  Sappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect artist.  She stirred the whole antique world more than Mrs. Browning ever stirred our modern age.  Never had Love such a singer.  Even in the few lines that remain to us the passion seems to scorch and burn.  But, as unjust Time, who has crowned her with the barren laurels of fame, has twined with them the dull poppies of oblivion, let us turn from the mere memory of a poetess to one whose song still remains to us as an imperishable glory to our literature; to her who heard the cry of the children from dark mine and crowded factory, and made England weep over its little ones; who, in the feigned sonnets from the Portuguese, sang of the spiritual mystery of Love, and of the intellectual gifts that Love brings to the soul; who had faith in all that is worthy, and enthusiasm for all that is great, and pity for all that suffers; who wrote the _Vision of Poets_ and _Casa Guidi Windows_ and _Aurora Leigh_.  As one, to whom I owe my love of poetry no less than my love of country, said of her:  She lives indeed, and not alone in the heart of Shakespeare's England, but in the heart of Dante's Italy also.  To Greek literature she owed her scholarly culture, but modern Italy created her human passion for Liberty.  When she crossed the Alps she became filled with a new ardour, and from that fine, eloquent mouth, that we can still see in her portraits, broke forth such a noble and majestic outburst of lyrical song as had not been heard from woman's lips for more than two thousand years. It is pleasant to think that an English poetess was to a certain extent a real factor in bringing about that unity of Italy that was Dante's dream, and if Florence drove her great singer into exile, she at least welcomed within her walls the later singer that England had sent to her.  If one were asked the chief qualities of Mrs. Browning's work, one would say, as Mr. Swinburne said of Byron's, its sincerity and its strength. Faults it, of course, possesses.  ?She would rhyme moon to table,? used to be said of her in jest; and certainly no more monstrous rhymes are to be found in all literature than some of those we come across in Mrs. Browning's poems.  But her ruggedness was never the result of carelessness.  It was deliberate, as her letters to Mr. Horne show very clearly.  She refused to sandpaper her muse.  She disliked facile smoothness and artificial polish.  In her very rejection of art she was an artist.  She intended to produce a certain effect by certain means, and she succeeded; and her indifference to complete assonance in rhyme often gives a splendid richness to her verse, and brings into it a pleasurable element of surprise.  In philosophy she was a Platonist, in politics an Opportunist.  She attached herself to no particular party.  She loved the people when they were king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men.  Of the real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea.  ?Poetry,? she says, in the preface of one of her volumes, ?has been as serious a thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing. There has been no playing at skittles for me in either.  I never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the poet.  I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and head work apart from the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being to which I could attain.?  It certainly is her completest expression, and through it she realizes her fullest perfection.  ?The poet,? she says elsewhere, ?is at once richer and poorer than he used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but speaks no more oracles.?  These words give us the keynote to her view of the poet's mission.  He was to utter Divine oracles, to be at once inspired prophet and holy priest; and as such we may, I think, without exaggeration, conceive her.  She was a Sibyl delivering a message to the world, sometimes through stammering lips, and once at least with blinded eyes, yet always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken faith, always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature, the high ardours of an impassioned soul.  As we read her best poems we feel that, though Apollo's shrine be empty and the bronze tripod overthrown, and the vale of Delphi desolate, still the Pythia is not dead.  In our own age she has sung for us, and this land gave her new birth.  Indeed, Mrs. Browning is the wisest of the Sibyls, wiser even than that mighty figure whom Michael Angelo has painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at Rome, poring over the scroll of mystery, and trying to decipher the secrets of Fate; for she realized that, while knowledge is power, suffering is part of knowledge.  To her influence, almost as much as to the higher education of women, I would be inclined to attribute the really remarkable awakening of woman's song that characterizes the latter half of our century in England.  No country has ever had so many poetesses at once.  Indeed, when one remembers that the Greeks had only nine muses, one is sometimes apt to fancy that we have too many.  And yet the work done by women in the sphere of poetry is really of a very high standard of excellence.  In England we have always been prone to underrate the value of tradition in literature.  In our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of music, we have forgotten how beautiful Echo may be.  We look first for individuality and personality, and these are, indeed, the chief characteristics of the masterpieces of our literature, either in prose or verse; but deliberate culture and a study of the best models, if united to an artistic temperament and a nature susceptible of exquisite impressions, may produce much that is admirable, much that is worthy of praise.  It would be quite impossible to give a complete catalogue of all the women who since Mrs. Browning's day have tried lute and lyre.  Mrs. Pfeiffer, Mrs. Hamilton King, Mrs. Augusta Webster, Graham Tomson, Miss Mary Robinson, Jean Ingelow, Miss May Kendall, Miss Nesbit, Miss May Probyn, Mrs. Craik, Mrs. Meynell, Miss Chapman, and many others have|2
9| done really good work in poetry, either in the grave Dorian mode of thoughtful and intellectual verse, or in the light and graceful forms of old French song, or in the romantic manner of antique ballad, or in that ?moment's monument,? as Rossetti called it, the intense and concentrated sonnet. Occasionally one is tempted to wish that the quick, artistic faculty that women undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and somewhat less in verse.  Poetry is for our highest moods, when we wish to be with the gods, and in our poetry nothing but the very best should satisfy us; but prose is for our daily bread, and the lack of good prose is one of the chief blots on our culture.  French prose, even in the hands of the most ordinary writers, is always readable, but English prose is detestable.  We have a few, a very few, masters, such as they are.  We have Carlyle, who should not be imitated; and Mr. Pater, who, through the subtle perfection of his form, is inimitable absolutely; and Mr. Froude, who is useful; and Matthew Arnold, who is a model; and Mr. George Meredith, who is a warning; and Mr. Lang, who is the divine amateur; and Mr. Stevenson, who is the humane artist; and Mr. Ruskin, whose rhythm and colour and fine rhetoric and marvellous music of words are entirely unattainable.  But the general prose that one reads in magazines and in newspapers is terribly dull and cumbrous, heavy in movement and uncouth or exaggerated in expression.  Possibly some day our women of letters will apply themselves more definitely to prose.  Their light touch, and exquisite ear, and delicate sense of balance and proportion would be of no small service to us.  I can fancy women bringing a new manner into our literature.  However, we have to deal here with women as poetesses, and it is interesting to note that, though Mrs. Browning's influence undoubtedly contributed very largely to the development of this new song-movement, if I may so term it, still there seems to have been never a time during the last three hundred years when the women of this kingdom did not cultivate, if not the art, at least the habit, of writing poetry.  Who the first English poetess was I cannot say.  I believe it was the Abbess Juliana Berners, who lived in the fifteenth century; but I have no doubt that Mr. Freeman would be able at a moment's notice to produce some wonderful Saxon or Norman poetess, whose works cannot be read without a glossary, and even with its aid are completely unintelligible.  For my own part, I am content with the Abbess Juliana, who wrote enthusiastically about hawking; and after her I would mention Anne Askew, who in prison and on the eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that has, at any rate, a pathetic and historical interest.  Queen Elizabeth's ?most sweet and sententious ditty? on Mary Stuart is highly praised by Puttenham, a contemporary critic, as an example of ?Exargasia, or the Gorgeous in Literature,? which somehow seems a very suitable epithet for such a great Queen's poems.  The term she applies to the unfortunate Queen of Scots, ?the daughter of debate,? has, of course, long since passed into literature.  The Countess of Pembroke, Sir Philip Sidney's sister, was much admired as a poetess in her day.  In 1613 the ?learned, virtuous, and truly noble ladie,? Elizabeth Carew, published a _Tragedie of Marian_, _the Faire Queene of Jewry_, and a few years later the ?noble ladie Diana Primrose? wrote _A Chain of Pearl_, which is a panegyric on the ?peerless graces? of Gloriana.  Mary Morpeth, the friend and admirer of Drummond of Hawthornden; Lady Mary Wroth, to whom Ben Jonson dedicated _The Alchemist_; and the Princess Elizabeth, the sister of Charles I., should also be mentioned.  After the Restoration women applied themselves with still greater ardour to the study of literature and the practice of poetry.  Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, was a true woman of letters, and some of her verses are extremely pretty and graceful.  Mrs. Aphra Behn was the first Englishwoman who adopted literature as a regular profession.  Mrs. Katharine Philips, according to Mr. Gosse, invented sentimentality.  As she was praised by Dryden, and mourned by Cowley, let us hope she may be forgiven.  Keats came across her poems at Oxford when he was writing _Endymion_, and found in one of them ?a most delicate fancy of the Fletcher kind?; but I fear nobody reads the Matchless Orinda now.  Of Lady Winchelsea's _Nocturnal Reverie_ Wordsworth said that, with the exception of Pope's _Windsor Forest_, it was the only poem of the period intervening between _Paradise Lost_ and Thomson's _Seasons_ that contained a single new image of external nature.  Lady Rachel Russell, who may be said to have inaugurated the letter-writing literature of England; Eliza Haywood, who is immortalized by the badness of her work, and has a niche in _The Dunciad_; and the Marchioness of Wharton, whose poems Waller said he admired, are very remarkable types, the finest of them being, of course, the first named, who was a woman of heroic mould and of a most noble dignity of nature.  Indeed, though the English poetesses up to the time of Mrs. Browning cannot be said to have produced any work of absolute genius, they are certainly interesting figures, fascinating subjects for study.  Amongst them we find Lady Mary Wortley Montague, who had all the caprice of Cleopatra, and whose letters are delightful reading; Mrs. Centlivre, who wrote one brilliant comedy; Lady Anne Barnard, whose _Auld Robin Gray_ was described by Sir Walter Scott as ?worth all the dialogues Corydon and Phillis have together spoken from the days of Theocritus downwards,? and is certainly a very beautiful and touching poem; Esther Vanhomrigh and Hester Johnson, the Vanessa and the Stella of Dean Swift's life; Mrs. Thrale, the friend of the great lexicographer; the worthy Mrs. Barbauld; the excellent Miss Hannah More; the industrious Joanna Baillie; the admirable Mrs. Chapone, whose _Ode to Solitude_ always fills me with the wildest passion for society, and who will at least be remembered as the patroness of the establishment at which Becky Sharp was educated; Miss Anna Seward, who was called ?The Swan of Lichfield?; poor L. E. L. whom Disraeli described in one of his clever letters to his sister as ?the personification of Brompton?pink satin dress, white satin shoes, red cheeks, snub nose, and her hair _? la_ Sappho?; Mrs. Ratcliffe, who introduced the romantic novel, and has consequently much to answer for; the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire, of whom Gibbon said that she was ?made for something better than a Duchess?; the two wonderful sisters, Lady Dufferin and Mrs. Norton; Mrs. Tighe, whose _Psyche_ Keats read with pleasure; Constantia Grierson, a marvellous blue-stocking in her time; Mrs. Hemans; pretty, charming ?Perdita,? who flirted alternately with poetry and the Prince Regent, played divinely in the _Winter's Tale_, was brutally attacked by Gifford, and has left us a pathetic little poem on a Snowdrop; and Emily Bront?, whose poems are instinct with tragic power, and seem often on the verge of being great.  Old fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions in dress. I like the costume of the age of powder better than the poetry of the age of Pope.  But if one adopts the historical standpoint?and this is, indeed, the only standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate of work that is not absolutely of the highest order?we cannot fail to see that many of the English poetesses who preceded Mrs. Browning were women of no ordinary talent, and that if the majority of them looked upon poetry simply as a department of _belles lettres_, so in most cases did their contemporaries.  Since Mrs. Browning's day our woods have become full of singing birds, and if I venture to ask them to apply themselves more to prose and less to song, it is not that I like poetical prose, but that I love the prose of poets.  There are certain problems in arch?ology that seem to possess a real romantic interest, and foremost among these is the question of the so-called Venus of Melos.  Who is she, this marble mutilated goddess whom Gautier loved, to whom Heine bent his knee?  What sculptor wrought her, and for what shrine?  Whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where the Melian peasant found her?  What symbol of her divinity did she carry? Was it apple of gold or shield of bronze?  Where is her city and what was her name among gods and men?  The last writer on this fascinating subject is Mr. Stillman, who in a most interesting book recently published in America, claims that the work of art in question is no sea-born and foam-born Aphrodite, but the very Victory Without Wings that once stood in the little chapel outside the gates of the Acropolis at Athens.  So long ago as 1826, that is to say six years after the discovery of the statue, the Venus hypothesis was violently attacked by Millingen, and from that time to this the battle of the arch?ologists has never ceased. Mr. Stillman, who fights, of course, under Millingen's banner, points out that the statue is not of the Venus type at all, being far too heroic in character to correspond to the Greek conception of Aphrodite at any period of their artistic development, but that it agrees distinctly with certain well-known statues of Victory, such as the celebrated ?Victory of Brescia.?  The latter is in bronze, is later, and has the wings, but the type is unmistakable, and though not a reproduction it is certainly a recollection of the Melian statue.  The representation of Victory on the coin of Agathocles is also obviously of the Melian type, and in the museum of Naples is a terra-cotta Victory in almost the identical action and drapery.  As for Dumont d?Urville's statement that, when the statue was discovered, one hand held an apple and the other a fold of the drapery, the latter is obviously a mistake, and the whole evidence on the subject is so contradictory that no reliance can be placed on the statement made by the French Consul and the French naval officers, none of whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm and hand now in the Louvre were really found in the same niche as the statue at all.  At any rate, these fragments seem to be of extremely inferior workmanship, and they are so imperfect that they are quite worthless as data for measure or opinion.  So far, Mr. Stillman is on old ground.  His real artistic discovery is this.  In working about the Acropolis of Athens, some years ago, he photographed among other sculptures the mutilated Victories in the Temple of Nik? Apteros, the ?Wingless Victory,? the little Ionic temple in which stood that statue of Victory of which it was said that ?_the Athenians made her without wings that she might never leave Athens_.?  Looking over the photographs afterwards, when the impression of the comparatively diminutive size had passed, he was struck with the close resemblance of the type to that of the Melian statue.  Now, this resemblance is so striking that it cannot be questioned by any one who has an eye for form.  There are the same large heroic proportions, the same ampleness of physical development, and the same treatment of drapery, and there is also that perfect spiritual kinship which, to any true antiquarian, is one of the most valuable modes of evidence.  Now it is generally admitted on both sides that the Melian statue is probably Attic in its origin, and belongs certainly to the period between Phidias and Praxiteles, that is to say, to the age of Scopas, if it be not actually the work of Scopas himself; and as it is to Scopas that these bas-reliefs have been always attributed, the similarity of style can, on Mr. Stillman's hypothesis, be easily accounted for.  As regards the appearance of the statue in Melos, Mr. Stillman points out that Melos belonged to Athens as late as she had any Greek allegiance, and that it is probable that the statue was sent there for concealment on the occasion of some siege or invasion.  When this took place, Mr. Stillman does not pretend to decide with any degree of certainty, but it is evident that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of the Roman hegemony, as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue was found is clearly Roman in character, and before the time of Pausanias and Pliny, as neither of these antiquaries mentions the statue.  Accepting, then, the statue as that of the Victory Without Wings, Mr. Stillman agrees with Millingen in supposing that in her left hand she held a bronze shield, the lower rim of which rested on the left knee where some marks of the kind are easily recognizable, while with her right hand she traced, or had just finished tracing, the names of the great heroes of Athens.  Valentin's objection, that if this were so the left thigh would incline outwards so as to secure a balance, Mr. Stillman meets partly by the analogy of the Victory of Brescia and partly by the evidence of Nature herself; for he has had a model photographed in the same position as the statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in his restoration.  The result is precisely the contrary to that which Valentin assumes.  Of course, Mr. Stillman's solution of the whole matter must not be regarded as an absolutely scientific demonstration.  It is simply an induction in which a kind of artistic instinct, not communicable or equally valuable to all people, has had the greatest part, but to this mode of interpretation arch?ologists as a class have been far too indifferent; and it is certain that in the present case it has given us a theory which is most fruitful and suggestive.  The little temple of Nik? Apteros has had, as Mr. Stillman reminds us, a destiny unique of its kind.  Like the Parthenon, it was standing little more than two hundred years ago, but during the Turkish occupation it was razed, and its stones all built into the great bastion which covered the front of the Acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the Propyl?a.  It was dug out and restored, nearly every stone in its place, by two German architects during the reign of Otho, and it stands again just as Pausanias described it on the spot where old ?geus watched for the return of Theseus from Crete.  In the distance are Salamis and ?gina, and beyond the purple hills lies Marathon.  If the Melian statue be indeed the Victory Without Wings, she had no unworthy shrine.  There are some other interesting essays in Mr. Stillman's book on the wonderful topographical knowledge of Ithaca displayed in the _Odyssey_, and discussions of this kind are always interesting as long as there is no attempt to represent Homer as the ordinary literary man; but the article on the Melian statue is by far the most important and the most delightful.  Some people will, no doubt, regret the possibility of the disappearance of the old name, and as Venus not as Victory will still worship the stately goddess, but there are others who will be glad to see in her the image and ideal of that spiritual enthusiasm to which Athens owed her liberty, and by which alone can liberty be won.  The biography of a very great man from the pen of a very ladylike writer?this is the best description we can give of M. Caro's Life of George Sand.  The late Professor of the Sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture, and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrase-maker; being an extremely superior person he had a great contempt for Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with the Duchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or in literature that he could not explain away for their edification; having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the Academy, and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that thoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution.  In fact, he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a Life of George Sand or to interpret George Sand's genius.  He was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature, too much of a _dilettante_ to realize the masculine force of that strong and ardent mind.  He never gets at the secret of George Sand, and never brings us near to her wonderful personality.  He looks on her simply as a litt?rateur, as a writer of pretty stories of country life and of charming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances.  But George Sand was much more than this.  Beautiful as are such books as _Consuelo_ and _Mauprat_, _Fran?ois le Champi_ and _La Mare au Diable_, yet in none of them is she adequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately revealed.  As Mr. Matthew Arnold said, many years ago, ?We do not know George Sand unless we feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole.?  With this spirit, however, M. Caro has no sympathy.  Madame Sand's doctrines are antediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of social regeneration are Utopian, incoherent and absurd.  The best thing for us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read _Teverino_ and _Le Secr?taire Intime_.  Poor M. Caro!  This spirit, which he treats with such airy flippancy, is the very leaven of modern life.  It is remoulding the world for us and fashioning our age anew.  If it is antediluvian, it is so because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then Utopia must be added to our geographies.  To what curious straits M. Caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be estimated by the fact that he tries to class George Sand's novels with the old _Chansons de geste_, the stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures; whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as a means of influencing the social ideals of her age, George Sand was merely carrying out the traditions of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Diderot and of Chateaubriand.  The novel, says M. Caro, must be allied either to poetry or to science.  That it has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have occurred to him.  In an English critic such a view might possibly be excusable.  Our greatest novelists, such as Fielding, Scott and Thackeray, cared little for the philosophy of their age.  But coming, as it does, from a French critic, the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important elements of French fiction.  Nor, even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself, can M. Caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic.  To take merely one instance out of many, he says nothing of George Sand's delightful treatment of art and the artist's life.  And yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life!  In _Consuelo_ she tells us of music; in _Horace_ of authorship; in _Le Ch?teau des D'sertes_ of acting; in _Les Ma?tres Mosa'stes_ of mosaic work; in _Le Ch?teau de Pictordu_ of portrait painting; and in _La Daniella_ of the painting of landscape. What Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning have done for England she did for France.  She invented an art literature.  It is unnecessary, however, to discuss any of M. Caro's minor failings, for the whole effect of the book, so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character of George Sand's genius, is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed from the beginning, and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and exclusive, we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a treatise on the subject.  As for Madame Sand's private life, which is so intimately connected with her art (for, like Goethe, she had to live her romances before she could write them), M. Caro says hardly anything about it.  He passes it over with a modesty that almost makes one blush, and for fear of wounding the susceptibilities of those _grandes dames_ whose passions M. Paul Bourget analyses with such subtlety, he transforms her mother, who was a typical French _grisette_, into ?a very amiable and _spirituelle_ milliner?!  It must be admitted that Joseph Surface himself could hardly show greater tact and delicacy, though we ourselves must plead guilty to preferring Madame Sand's own description of her as an ?enfant du vieux pav? de Paris.?  Mr. Alan Cole's carefully-edited translation of M. Lef?bure's history of _Embroidery and Lace_ is one of the most fascinating books that has appeared on this delightful subject.  M. Lef?bure is one of the administrators of the Mus?e des Arts D?coratifs at Paris, besides being a lace manufacturer; and his work has not merely an important historical value, but as a handbook of technical instruction it will be found of the greatest service by all needle-women.  Indeed, as the translator himself points out, M. Lef?bure's book suggests the question whether it is not rather by the needle and the bobbin, than by the brush, the graver or the chisel, that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts.  In Europe, at any rate, woman is sovereign in the domain of art-needlework, and few men would care to dispute with her the right of using those delicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of her nimble and slender fingers; nor is there any reason why the productions of embroidery should not, as Mr. Alan Cole suggests, be placed on the same level with those of painting, engraving and sculpture, though there must always be a great difference between those purely decorative arts that glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which the material is, as it were, annihilated, and absorbed into the creation of a new form.  In the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must be admitted?indeed, it should be more generally recognized than it is?that rich embroidery on hangings and curtains, _porti?res_, couches and the like, produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect than can be gained from our somewhat wearisome English practice of covering the walls with pictures and engravings; and the almost complete disappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of one of the chief elements of grace and fancy.  That, however, a great improvement has taken place in English embroidery during the last ten or fifteen years cannot, I think, be denied.  It is shown, not merely in the work of individual artists, such as Mrs. Holiday, Miss May Morris and others, but also in the admirable productions of the South Kensington School of Embroidery (the best?indeed, the only real good'school that South Kensington has produced).  It is pleasant to note on turning over the leaves of M. Lef?bure's book, that in this we are merely carrying out certain old traditions of Early English art.  In the seventh century, St. Ethelreda, first abbess of the monastery of Ely, made an offering to St. Cuthbert of a sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones, and the cope and maniple of St. Cuthbert, which are preserved at Durham, are considered to be specimens of _opus Anglicanum_.  In the year 800, the Bishop of Durham allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres for life to an embroideress named Eanswitha, in consideration of her keeping in repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese.  The battle standard of King Alfred was embroidered by Danish Princesses; and the Anglo-Saxon Gudric gave Alcuid a piece of land, on condition that she instructed his daughter in needle-work.  Queen Mathilda bequeathed to the Abbey of the Holy Trinity at Caen a tunic embroidered at Winchester by the wife of one Alderet; and when William presented himself to the English nobles, after the Battle of Hastings, he wore a mantle covered with Anglo-Saxon embroideries, which is probably, M. Lef?bure suggests, the same as that mentioned in the inventory of the Bayeux Cathedral, where, after the entry relating to the _broderie ? telle_ (representing the conquest of England), two mantles are described?one of King William, ?all of gold, powdered with crosses and blossoms of gold, and edged along the lower border with an orphrey of figures.?  The most splendid example of the _opus Anglicanum_ now in existence is, of course, the Syon cope at the South Kensington Museum; but English work seems to have been celebrated all over the Continent.  Pope Innocent IV. so admired the splendid vestments worn by the English clergy in 1246, that he ordered similar articles from Cistercian monasteries in England.  St. Dunstan, the artistic English monk, was known as a designer for embroideries; and the stole of St. Thomas ? Becket is still preserved in the cathedral at Sens, and shows us the interlaced scroll-forms used by Anglo-Saxon MS. illuminators.  How far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate embroidery will bear fruit depends, of course, almost entirely on the energy and study that women are ready to devote to it; but I think that it must be admitted that all our decorative arts in Europe at present have, at least, this element of strength?that they are in immediate relationship with the decorative arts of Asia.  Wherever we find in European history a revival of decorative art, it has, I fancy, nearly always been due to Oriental influence and contact with Oriental nations.  Our own keenly intellectual art has more than once been ready to sacrifice real decorative beauty either to imitative presentation or to ideal motive. It has taken upon itself the burden of expression, and has sought to interpret the secrets of thought and passion.  In its marvellous truth of presentation it has found its strength, and yet its weakness is there also.  It is never with impunity that an art seeks to mirror life.  If Truth has her revenge upon those who do not follow her, she is often pitiless to her worshippers.  In Byzantium the two arts met?Greek art, with its intellectual sense of form, and its quick sympathy with humanity; Oriental art, with its gorgeous materialism, its frank rejection of imitation, its wonderful secrets of craft and colour, its splendid textures, its rare metals and jewels, its marvellous and priceless traditions.  They had, indeed, met before, but in Byzantium they were married; and the sacred tree of the Persians, the palm of Zoroaster, was embroidered on the hem of the garments of the Western world.  Even the Iconoclasts, the Philistines of theological history, who, in one of those strange outbursts of rage against Beauty that seem to occur only amongst European nations, rose up against the wonder and magnificence of the new art, served merely to distribute its secrets more widely; and in the _Liber Pontificalis_, written in 687 by Athanasius, the librarian, we read of an influx into Rome of gorgeous embroideries, the work of men who had arrived from Constantinople and from Greece.  The triumph of the Mussulman gave the decorative art of Europe a new departure?that very principle of their religion that forbade the actual representation of any object in nature being of the greatest artistic service to them, though it was not, of course, strictly carried out.  The Saracens introduced into Sicily the art of weaving silken and golden fabrics; and from Sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to the North of Italy, and became localized in Genoa, Florence, Venice, and other towns.  A still greater art-movement took place in Spain under the Moors and Saracens, who brought over workmen from Persia to make beautiful things for them.  M. Lef?bure tells us of Persian embroidery penetrating as far as Andalusia; and Almeria, like Palermo, had its H?tel des Tiraz, which rivalled the H?tel des Tiraz at Bagdad, _tiraz_ being the generic name for ornamental tissues and costumes made with them. Spangles (those pretty little discs of gold, silver, or polished steel, used in certain embroidery for dainty glinting effects) were a Saracenic invention; and Arabic letters often took the place of letters in the Roman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered robes and Middle Age tapestries, their decorative value being so much greater.  The book of crafts by Etienne Boileau, provost of the merchants in 1258?1268, contains a curious enumeration of the different craft-guilds of Paris, among which we find ?the tapiciers, or makers of the _tapis sarrasinois_ (or Saracen cloths), who say that their craft is for the service only of churches, or great men like kings and co|2
10|unts?; and, indeed, even in our own day, nearly all our words descriptive of decorative textures and decorative methods point to an Oriental origin.  What the inroads of the Mohammedans did for Sicily and Spain, the return of the Crusaders did for the other countries of Europe.  The nobles who left for Palestine clad in armour, came back in the rich stuffs of the East; and their costumes, pouches (_aum?ni?res sarrasinoises_), and caparisons excited the admiration of the needle-workers of the West.  Matthew Paris says that at the sacking of Antioch, in 1098, gold, silver and priceless costumes were so equally distributed among the Crusaders, that many who the night before were famishing and imploring relief, suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with wealth; and Robert de Clair tells us of the wonderful f?tes that followed the capture of Constantinople.  The thirteenth century, as M. Lef?bure points out, was conspicuous for an increased demand in the West for embroidery.  Many Crusaders made offerings to churches of plunder from Palestine; and St. Louis, on his return from the first Crusade, offered thanks at St. Denis to God for mercies bestowed on him during his six years? absence and travel, and presented some richly embroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as coverings to the reliquaries containing the relics of holy martyrs.  European embroidery, having thus become possessed of new materials and wonderful methods, developed on its own intellectual and imitative lines, inclining, as it went on, to the purely pictorial, and seeking to rival painting, and to produce landscapes and figure-subjects with elaborate perspective and subtle aerial effects.  A fresh Oriental influence, however, came through the Dutch and the Portuguese, and the famous _Compagnie des Grandes Indes_; and M. Lef?bure gives an illustration of a door-hanging now in the Cluny Museum, where we find the French _fleurs-de-lys_ intermixed with Indian ornament.  The hangings of Madame de Maintenon's room at Fontainebleau, which were embroidered at St. Cyr, represent Chinese scenery upon a jonquil-yellow ground.  Clothes were sent out ready cut to the East to be embroidered, and many of the delightful coats of the period of Louis XV. and Louis XVI. owe their dainty decoration to the needles of Chinese artists.  In our own day the influence of the East is strongly marked.  Persia has sent us her carpets for patterns, and Cashmere her lovely shawls, and India her dainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates, and stitched over with iridescent beetles? wings.  We are beginning now to dye by Oriental methods, and the silk robes of China and Japan have taught us new wonders of colour-combination, and new subtleties of delicate design.  Whether we have yet learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is less certain.  If books produce an effect, this book of M. Lef?bure should certainly make us study with still deeper interest the whole question of embroidery, and by those who already work with their needles it will be found full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice.  Even to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant.  Time has kept a few fragments of Greek embroidery of the fourth century B.C. for us.  One is figured in M. Lef?bure's book?a chain-stitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberry-coloured worsted material, with graceful spirals and palmetto-patterns: and another, a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks, was reproduced in the _Woman's World_ some months ago for an article by Mr. Alan Cole. {115}  Now and then we find in the tomb of some dead Egyptian a piece of delicate work.  In the treasury at Ratisbon is preserved a specimen of Byzantine embroidery on which the Emperor Constantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey, and receiving homage from the East and West.  Metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles, the gift of Charlemagne, and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of Queen Matilda.  But where is the great crocus-coloured robe, wrought for Athena, on which the gods fought against the giants?  Where is the huge velarium that Nero stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds? How one would like to see the curious table-napkins wrought for Heliogabalus, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; or the mortuary-cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; or the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were embroidered with ?lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters?all, in fact, that painters can copy from nature.?  Charles of Orleans had a coat, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning ?_Madame_, _je suis tout joyeux_,? the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. {116}  The room prepared in the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy was decorated with ?thirteen hundred and twenty-one _papegauts_ (parrots) made in broidery and blazoned with the King's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the Queen's arms?the whole worked in fine gold.?  Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her ?of black velvet embroidered with pearls and powdered with crescents and suns.?  Its curtains were of damask, ?with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls,? and it stood in a room hung with rows of the Queen's devices in cut black velvet on cloth of silver.  Louis XIV. had gold-embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls, with verses from the Koran; its supports were of silver-gilt, beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  He had taken it from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mahomet had stood under it.  The Duchess de la Fert? wore a dress of reddish-brown velvet, the skirt of which, adjusted in graceful folds, was held up by big butterflies made of Dresden china; the front was a _tablier_ of cloth of silver, upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musicians arranged in a pyramidal group, consisting of a series of six ranks of performers, with beautiful instruments wrought in raised needle-work.  ?Into the night go one and all,? as Mr. Henley sings in his charming _Ballade of Dead Actors_.  Many of the facts related by M. Lef?bure about the embroiderers? guilds are also extremely interesting.  Etienne Boileau, in his book of crafts, to which I have already alluded, tells us that a member of the guild was prohibited from using gold of less value than ?eight sous (about 6s.) the skein; he was bound to use the best silk, and never to mix thread with silk, because that made the work false and bad.?  The test or trial piece prescribed for a worker who was the son of a master-embroiderer was ?a single figure, a sixth of the natural size, to be shaded in gold?; whilst one not the son of a master was required to produce ?a complete incident with many figures.?  The book of crafts also mentions ?cutters-out and stencillers and illuminators? amongst those employed in the industry of embroidery.  In 1551 the Parisian Corporation of Embroiderers issued a notice that ?for the future, the colouring in representations of nude figures and faces should be done in three or four gradations of carnation-dyed silk, and not, as formerly, in white silks.?  During the fifteenth century every household of any position retained the services of an embroiderer by the year.  The preparation of colours also, whether for painting or for dyeing threads and textile fabrics, was a matter which, M. Lef?bure points out, received close attention from the artists of the Middle Ages.  Many undertook long journeys to obtain the more famous recipes, which they filed, subsequently adding to and correcting them as experience dictated.  Nor were great artists above making and supplying designs for embroidery.  Raphael made designs for Francis I., and Boucher for Louis XV.; and in the Ambras collection at Vienna is a superb set of sacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers Van Eyck and their pupils.  Early in the sixteenth century books of embroidery designs were produced, and their success was so great that in a few years French, German, Italian, Flemish, and English publishers spread broadcast books of design made by their best engravers.  In the same century, in order to give the designers opportunity of studying directly from nature, Jean Robin opened a garden with conservatories, in which he cultivated strange varieties of plants then but little known in our latitudes.  The rich brocades and brocadelles of the time are characterized by the introduction of large flowery patterns, with pomegranates and other fruits with fine foliage.  The second part of M. Lef?bure's book is devoted to the history of lace, and though some may not find it quite as interesting as the earlier portion it will more than repay perusal; and those who still work in this delicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it, as well as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs.  Compared to embroidery, lace seems comparatively modern.  M. Lef?bure and Mr. Alan Cole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to prove the existence of lace before the fifteenth century.  Of course in the East, light tissues, such as gauzes, muslins, and nets, were made at very early times, and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner of subsequent laces, and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery, or varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads. The threads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted together, and the borders of one of the many fashions of Roman toga were of open reticulated weaving.  The Egyptian Museum at the Louvre has a curious network embellished with glass beads; and the monk Reginald, who took part in opening the tomb of St. Cuthbert at Durham in the twelfth century, writes that the Saint's shroud had a fringe of linen threads an inch long, surmounted by a border, ?worked upon the threads,? with representations of birds and pairs of beasts, there being between each such pair a branching tree, a survival of the palm of Zoroaster, to which I have before alluded.  Our authors, however, do not in these examples recognize lace, the production of which involves more refined and artistic methods, and postulates a combination of skill and varied execution carried to a higher degree of perfection.  Lace, as we know it, seems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen.  White embroidery on linen has, M. Lef?bure remarks, a cold and monotonous aspect; that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect, but is apt to fade in frequent washing; but white embroidery relieved by open spaces in, or shapes cut from, the linen ground, is possessed of an entirely new charm; and from a sense of this the birth may be traced of an art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected between ornamental details of close texture and others of open-work.  Soon, also, was suggested the idea that, instead of laboriously withdrawing threads from stout linen, it would be more convenient to introduce a needle-made pattern into an open network ground, which was called a _lacis_.  Of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant. The Cluny Museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to Charles V.; and an alb of linen drawn-thread work, supposed to have been made by Anne of Bohemia (1527), is preserved in the cathedral at Prague. Catherine de Medicis had a bed draped with squares of _r'seuil_, or _lacis_, and it is recorded that ?the girls and servants of her household consumed much time in making squares of _r'seuil_.?  The interesting pattern-books for open-ground embroidery, of which the first was published in 1527 by Pierre Quinty, of Cologne, supply us with the means of tracing the stages in the transition from white thread embroidery to needle-point lace.  We meet in them with a style of needle-work which differs from embroidery in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation.  It is, in fact, true lace, done, as it were, ?in the air,? both ground and pattern being entirely produced by the lace-maker.  The elaborate use of lace in costume was, of course, largely stimulated by the fashion of wearing ruffs, and their companion cuffs or sleeves. Catherine de Medicis induced one Frederic Vinciolo to come from Italy and make ruffs and gadrooned collars, the fashion of which she started in France; and Henry III. was so punctilious over his ruffs that he would iron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather than see their pleats limp and out of shape.  The pattern-books also gave a great impulse to the art.  M. Lef?bure mentions German books with patterns of eagles, heraldic emblems, hunting scenes, and plants and leaves belonging to Northern vegetation; and Italian books, in which the _motifs_ consist of oleander blossoms, and elegant wreaths and scrolls, landscapes with mythological scenes, and hunting episodes, less realistic than the Northern ones, in which appear fauns, and nymphs or _amorini_ shooting arrows.  With regard to these patterns, M. Lef?bure notices a curious fact.  The oldest painting in which lace is depicted is that of a lady, by Carpaccio, who died about 1523.  The cuffs of the lady are edged with a narrow lace, the pattern of which reappears in Vecellio's _Corona_, a book not published until 1591.  This particular pattern was, therefore, in use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with other published patterns.  It was not, however, till the seventeenth century that lace acquired a really independent character and individuality, and M. Duplessis states that the production of the more noteworthy of early laces owes more to the influence of men than to that of women.  The reign of Louis XIV. witnessed the production of the most stately needle-point laces, the transformation of Venetian point, and the growth of _Points d?Alen?on_, _d?Argentan_, _de Bruxelles_ and _d?Angleterre_.  The king, aided by Colbert, determined to make France the centre, if possible, for lace manufacture, sending for this purpose both to Venice and to Flanders for workers.  The studio of the Gobelins supplied designs.  The dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling from beneath the chin over the breast, and great prelates, like Bossuet and F?nelon, wore their wonderful albs and rochets.  It is related of a collar made at Venice for Louis XIV. that the lace-workers, being unable to find sufficiently fine horse-hair, employed some of their own hairs instead, in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they aimed at producing.  In the eighteenth century, Venice, finding that laces of lighter texture were sought after, set herself to make rose-point; and at the Court of Louis XV. the choice of lace was regulated by still more elaborate etiquette.  The Revolution, however, ruined many of the manufactures. Alen?on survived, and Napoleon encouraged it, and endeavoured to renew the old rules about the necessity of wearing point-lace at Court receptions.  A wonderful piece of lace, powdered over with devices of bees, and costing 40,000 francs, was ordered.  It was begun for the Empress Josephine, but in the course of its making her escutcheons were replaced by those of Marie Louise.  M. Lef?bure concludes his interesting history by stating very clearly his attitude towards machine-made lace.  ?It would be an obvious loss to art,? he says, 'should the making of lace by hand become extinct, for machinery, as skilfully devised as possible, cannot do what the hand does.?  It can give us ?the results of processes, not the creations of artistic handicraft.?  Art is absent ?where formal calculation pretends to supersede emotion?; it is absent ?where no trace can be detected of intelligence guiding handicraft, whose hesitancies even possess peculiar charm . . . cheapness is never commendable in respect of things which are not absolute necessities; it lowers artistic standard.?  These are admirable remarks, and with them we take leave of this fascinating book, with its delightful illustrations, its charming anecdotes, its excellent advice.  Mr. Alan Cole deserves the thanks of all who are interested in art for bringing this book before the public in so attractive and so inexpensive a form.  ?If I were king,? says Mr. Henley, in one of his most modest rondeaus,  And these lines contain, if not the best criticism of his own work, certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet.  His little _Book of Verses_ reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find new methods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and a brilliant, fantastic wit, but a real passion also for what is horrible, ugly, or grotesque.  No doubt, everything that is worthy of existence is worthy also of art?at least, one would like to think so?but while echo or mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing, to render artistically a thing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of form, the most subtle magic of transformation.  To me there is more of the cry of Marsyas than of the singing of Apollo in the earlier poems of Mr. Henley's volume, _In Hospital_: _Rhymes and Rhythms_, as he calls them.  But it is impossible to deny their power.  Some of them are like bright, vivid pastels; others like charcoal drawings, with dull blacks and murky whites; others like etchings with deeply-bitten lines, and abrupt contrasts, and clever colour-suggestions.  In fact, they are like anything and everything, except perfected poems?that they certainly are not.  They are still in the twilight.  They are preludes, experiments, inspired jottings in a note-book, and should be heralded by a design of ?Genius Making Sketches.?  Rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to verse; it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the arts is so pleasurable, and is, indeed, one of the secrets of perfection; it will whisper, as a French critic has said, ?things unexpected and charming, things with strange and remote relations to each other,? and bind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty; and in his constant rejection of rhyme, Mr. Henley seems to me to have abdicated half his power.  He is a _roi en exil_ who has thrown away some of the strings of his lute; a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom.  However, all work criticizes itself.  Here is one of Mr. Henley's inspired jottings.  According to the temperament of the reader, it will serve either as a model or as the reverse:  In this poem, the rhythm and the music, such as it is, are obvious?perhaps a little too obvious.  In the following I see nothing but ingeniously printed prose.  It is a description?and a very accurate one?of a scene in a hospital ward.  The medical students are supposed to be crowding round the doctor.  What I quote is only a fragment, but the poem itself is a fragment:  Th?ophile Gautier once said that Flaubert's style was meant to be read, and his own style to be looked at.  Mr. Henley's unrhymed rhythms form very dainty designs, from a typographical point of view.  From the point of view of literature, they are a series of vivid, concentrated impressions, with a keen grip of fact, a terrible actuality, and an almost masterly power of picturesque presentation.  But the poetic form?what of that?  Well, let us pass to the later poems, to the rondels and rondeaus, the sonnets and quatorzains, the echoes and the ballades.  How brilliant and fanciful this is!  The Toyokuni colour-print that suggested it could not be more delightful.  It seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic charm of the original:  This rondel, too?how light it is, and graceful!?    There are fine verses, also, scattered through this little book; some of them very strong, as?  Others with a true touch of romance, as?  And here and there we come across such felicitous phrases as?  or?  and many other graceful or fanciful lines, even ?the green sky's minor thirds? being perfectly right in its place, and a very refreshing bit of affectation in a volume where there is so much that is natural.  However, Mr. Henley is not to be judged by samples.  Indeed, the most attractive thing in the book is no single poem that is in it, but the strong humane personality that stands behind both flawless and faulty work alike, and looks out through many masks, some of them beautiful, and some grotesque, and not a few misshapen.  In the case with most of our modern poets, when we have analysed them down to an adjective, we can go no further, or we care to go no further; but with this book it is different.  Through these reeds and pipes blows the very breath of life. It seems as if one could put one's hand upon the singer's heart and count its pulsations.  There is something wholesome, virile and sane about the man's soul.  Anybody can be reasonable, but to be sane is not common; and sane poets are as rare as blue lilies, though they may not be quite so delightful.  is the concluding stanza of the last rondeau?indeed, of the last poem in the collection, and the high, serene temper displayed in these lines serves at once as keynote and keystone to the book.  The very lightness and slightness of so much of the work, its careless moods and casual fancies, seem to suggest a nature that is not primarily interested in art?a nature, like Sordello's, passionately enamoured of life, one to which lyre and lute are things of less importance.  From this mere joy of living, this frank delight in experience for its own sake, this lofty indifference, and momentary unregretted ardours, come all the faults and all the beauties of the volume.  But there is this difference between them?the faults are deliberate, and the result of much study; the beauties have the air of fascinating impromptus.  Mr. Henley's healthy, if sometimes misapplied, confidence in the myriad suggestions of life gives him his charm.  He is made to sing along the highways, not to sit down and write.  If he took himself more seriously, his work would become trivial.  In a recent article on _English Poetesses_, I ventured to suggest that our women of letters should turn their attention somewhat more to prose and somewhat less to poetry.  Women seem to me to possess just what our literature wants?a light touch, a delicate hand, a graceful mode of treatment, and an unstudied felicity of phrase.  We want some one who will do for our prose what Madame de S?vign? did for the prose of France. George Eliot's style was far too cumbrous, and Charlotte Bront?'s too exaggerated.  However, one must not forget that amongst the women of England there have been some charming letter-writers, and certainly no book can be more delightful reading than Mrs. Ross's _Three Generations of English Women_, which has recently appeared.  The three Englishwomen whose memoirs and correspondence Mrs. Ross has so admirably edited are Mrs. John Taylor, Mrs. Sarah Austin, and Lady Duff Gordon, all of them remarkable personalities, and two of them women of brilliant wit and European reputation.  Mrs. Taylor belonged to that great Norwich family about whom the Duke of Sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinary saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man, and was for many years one of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of her native town.  Her only daughter married John Austin, the great authority on jurisprudence, and her _salon_ in Paris was the centre of the intellect and culture of her day.  Lucie Duff Gordon, the only child of John and Sarah Austin, inherited the talents of her parents.  A beauty, a _femme d?esprit_, a traveller, and clever writer, she charmed and fascinated her age, and her premature death in Egypt was really a loss to our literature.  It is to her daughter that we owe this delightful volume of memoirs.  First we are introduced to Mrs. Ross's great-grandmother, Mrs. Taylor, who ?was called, by her intimate friends, ?Madame Roland of Norwich,? from her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunate Frenchwoman.?  We hear of her darning her boy's grey worsted stockings while holding her own with Southey and Brougham, and dancing round the Tree of Liberty with Dr. Parr when the news of the fall of the Bastille was first known.  Amongst her friends were Sir James Mackintosh, the most popular man of the day, ?to whom Madame de Sta?l wrote, ?Il n?y a pas de soci?t? sans vous.?  ?C?est tr's ennuyeux de d?ner sans vous; la soci?t? ne va pas quand vous n??tes pas l??;? Sir James Smith, the botanist; Crabb Robinson; the Gurneys; Mrs. Barbauld; Dr. Alderson and his charming daughter, Amelia Opie; and many other well-known people.  Her letters are extremely sensible and thoughtful.  ?Nothing at present,? she says in one of them, 'suits my taste so well as Susan's Latin lessons, and her philosophical old master. . . . When we get to Cicero's discussions on the nature of the soul, or Virgil's fine descriptions, my mind is filled up.  Life is either a dull round of eating, drinking, and sleeping, or a spark of ethereal fire just kindled. . . . The character of girls must depend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep.  Besides the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge, a woman ought to consider it as her best resource against poverty.?  This is a somewhat caustic aphorism: ?A romantic woman is a troublesome friend, as she expects you to be as impudent as herself, and is mortified at what she calls coldness and insensibility.?  And this is admirable: ?The art of life is not to estrange oneself from society, and yet not to pay too dear for it.?  This, too, is good: ?Vanity, like curiosity, is wanted as a stimulus to exertion; indolence would certainly get the better of us if it were not for these two powerful principles?; and there is a keen touch of humour in the following: ?Nothing is so gratifying as the idea that virtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable.?  Dr. James Martineau, in a letter to Mrs. Ross, gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady returning from market ?weighted by her huge basket, with the shank of a leg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents,? and talking divinely about philosophy, poets, politics, and every intellectual topic of the day.  She was a woman of admirable good sense, a type of Roman matron, and quite as careful as were the Roman matrons to keep up the purity of her native tongue.  Mrs. Taylor, however, was more or less limited to Norwich.  Mrs. Austin was for the world.  In London, Paris, and Germany, she ruled and dominated society, loved by every one who knew her.  ?She is ?My best and brightest? to Lord Jeffrey; ?Dear, fair and wise? to Sydney Smith; ?My great ally? to Sir James Stephen; ?Sunlight through waste weltering chaos? to Thomas Carlyle (while he needed her aid); ?La petite m?re du genre humain? to Michael Chevalier; ?Liebes M?tterlein? to John Stuart Mill; and ?My own Professorin? to Charles Buller, to whom she taught German, as well as to the sons of Mr. James Mill.?  Jeremy Bentham, when on his deathbed, gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair let in behind.  ?There, my dear,? he said, ?it is the only ring I ever gave a woman.?  She corresponded with Guizot, Barthelemy de St. Hilaire, the Grotes, Dr. Whewell, the Master of Trinity, Nassau Senior, the Duchesse d?Orl?ans, Victor Cousin, and many other distinguished people. Her translation of Ranke's _History of the Popes_ is admirable; indeed, all her literary work was thoroughly well done, and her edition of her husband's _Province of Jurisprudence_ deserves the very highest praise. Two people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been difficult to find.  He was habitually grave and despondent; she was brilliantly handsome, fond of society, in which she shone, and ?with an almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits,? Mrs. Ross tells us. She married him because she thought him perfect, but he never produced |2
11|the work of which he was worthy, and of which she knew him to be worthy. Her estimate of him in the preface to the _Jurisprudence_ is wonderfully striking and simple.  ?He was never sanguine.  He was intolerant of any imperfection.  He was always under the control of severe love of truth. He lived and died a poor man.?  She was terribly disappointed in him, but she loved him.  Some years after his death, she wrote to M. Guizot:  The most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to M. Guizot, with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship; but there is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever, or thoughtful, or witty, while those addressed to her, in turn, are very interesting.  Carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations, the wail of a Titan in pain, superbly exaggerated for literary effect.  Henri Beyle (Stendhal), the great, I am often tempted to think the greatest of French novelists, writes her a charming letter about _nuances_.  ?It seems to me,? he says, ?that except when they read Shakespeare, Byron, or Sterne, no Englishman understands ?_nuances_?; we adore them.  A fool says to a woman ?I love you?; the words mean nothing, he might as well say ?Olli Batachor?; it is the _nuance_ which gives force to the meaning.?  In 1839 Mrs. Austin writes to Victor Cousin: ?I have seen young Gladstone, a distinguished Tory who wants to re-establish education based on the Church in quite a Catholic form?; and we find her corresponding with Mr. Gladstone on the subject of education.  ?If you are strong enough to provide motives and checks,? she says to him, ?you may do two blessed acts?reform your clergy and teach your people.  As it is, how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people?!  Mr. Gladstone replies at great length, and in many letters, from which we may quote this passage:  Lord Jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular education, in which he denies, or at least doubts, the effect of this education on morals.  He, however, supports it on the ground ?that it will increase the enjoyment of individuals,? which is certainly a very sensible claim.  Humboldt writes to her about an old Indian language which was preserved by a parrot, the tribe who spoke it having been exterminated, and about ?young Darwin,? who had just published his first book.  Here are some extracts from her own letters:  In politics Mrs. Austin was a philosophical Tory.  Radicalism she detested, and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as moribund.  ?The Radical party is evidently effete,? she writes to M. Victor Cousin; the probable ?leader of the Tory party? is Mr. Gladstone. ?The people must be instructed, must be guided, must be, in short, governed,? she writes elsewhere; and in a letter to Dr. Whewell, she says that the state of things in France fills ?me with the deepest anxiety on one point,?the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our salvation as a nation turn.  Are our higher classes able to keep the lead of the rest?  If they are, we are safe; if not, I agree with my poor dear Charles Buller?_our_ turn must come.  Now Cambridge and Oxford must really look to this.?  The belief in the power of the Universities to stem the current of democracy is charming.  She grew to regard Carlyle as ?one of the dissolvents of the age?as mischievous as his extravagances will let him be?; speaks of Kingsley and Maurice as ?pernicious?; and talks of John Stuart Mill as a ?demagogue.?  She was no _doctrinaire_. ?One ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed.  It is no use to give the meat before you give the hunger.?  She was delighted at a letter of St. Hilaire's, in which he said, ?We have a system and no results; you have results and no system.?  Yet she had a deep sympathy with the wants of the people.  She was horrified at something Babbage told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are _worked out_ before they attain to thirty years of age.  ?But I am persuaded that the remedy will not, cannot come from the people,? she adds.  Many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher education of women.  She discusses Buckle's lecture on ?The Influence of Women upon the Progress of Knowledge,? admits to M. Guizot that women's intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions, but adds: ?One is not precisely a fool because one's opinions are greatly influenced by one's affections.  The opinions of men are often influenced by worse things.?  Dr. Whewell consults her about lecturing women on Plato, being slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous; Comte writes her elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress; and Mr. Gladstone promises that Mrs. Gladstone will carry out at Hawarden the suggestions contained in one of her pamphlets.  She was always very practical, and never lost her admiration for plain sewing.  All through the book we come across interesting and amusing things.  She gets St. Hilaire to order a large, sensible bonnet for her in Paris, which was at once christened the ?Aristotelian,? and was supposed to be the only useful bonnet in England.  Grote has to leave Paris after the _coup d??tat_, he tells her, because he cannot bear to see the establishment of a Greek tyrant.  Alfred de Vigny, Macaulay, John Stirling, Southey, Alexis de Tocqueville, Hallam, and Jean Jacques Amp?re all contribute to these pleasant pages.  She seems to have inspired the warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her.  Guizot writes to her: ?Madame de Sta?l used to say that the best thing in the world was a serious Frenchman.  I turn the compliment, and say that the best thing in the world is an affectionate Englishman.  How much more an Englishwoman! Given equal qualities, a woman is always more charming than a man.?  Lucie Austin, afterwards Lady Duff Gordon, was born in 1821.  Her chief playfellow was John Stuart Mill, and Jeremy Bentham's garden was her playground.  She was a lovely, romantic child, who was always wanting the flowers to talk to her, and used to invent the most wonderful stories about animals, of whom she was passionately fond.  In 1834 Mrs. Austin decided on leaving England, and Sydney Smith wrote his immortal letter to the little girl:  At Boulogne she sat next Heine at _table d?h?te_.  ?He heard me speak German to my mother, and soon began to talk to me, and then said, ?When you go back to England, you can tell your friends that you have seen Heinrich Heine.?  I replied, ?And who is Heinrich Heine??  He laughed heartily and took no offence at my ignorance; and we used to lounge on the end of the pier together, where he told me stories in which fish, mermaids, water-sprites and a very funny old French fiddler with a poodle were mixed up in the most fanciful manner, sometimes humorous, and very often pathetic, especially when the water-sprites brought him greetings from the ?Nord See.?  He was . . . so kind to me and so sarcastic to every one else.?  Twenty years afterwards the little girl whose ?braune Augen? Heine had celebrated in his charming poem _Wenn ick an deinem Hause_, used to go and see the dying poet in Paris.  ?It does one good,? he said to her, ?to see a woman who does not carry about a broken heart, to be mended by all sorts of men, like the women here, who do not see that a total want of heart is their real failing.?  On another occasion he said to her: ?I have now made peace with the whole world, and at last also with God, who sends thee to me as a beautiful angel of death: I shall certainly soon die.?  Lady Duff Gordon said to him: ?Poor Poet, do you still retain such splendid illusions, that you transform a travelling Englishwoman into Azrael?  That used not to be the case, for you always disliked us.?  He answered: ?Yes, I do not know what possessed me to dislike the English, . . . it really was only petulance; I never hated them, indeed, I never knew them.  I was only once in England, but knew no one, and found London very dreary, and the people and the streets odious. But England has revenged herself well; she has sent me most excellent friends?thyself and Milnes, that good Milnes.?  There are delightful letters from Dicky Doyle here, with the most amusing drawings, one of the present Sir Robert Peel as he made his maiden speech in the House being excellent; and the various descriptions of Hassan's performances are extremely amusing.  Hassan was a black boy, who had been turned away by his master because he was going blind, and was found by Lady Duff Gordon one night sitting on her doorstep.  She took care of him, and had him cured, and he seems to have been a constant source of delight to every one.  On one occasion, ?when Prince Louis Napoleon (the late Emperor of the French) came in unexpectedly, he gravely said: ?Please, my lady, I ran out and bought twopennyworth of sprats for the Prince, and for the honour of the house.??  Here is an amusing letter from Mrs. Norton:  Lady Duff Gordon's _Letters from the Cape_, and her brilliant translation of _The Amber Witch_, are, of course, well known.  The latter book was, with Lady Wilde's translation of _Sidonia the Sorceress_, my favourite romantic reading when a boy.  Her letters from Egypt are wonderfully vivid and picturesque.  Here is an interesting bit of art criticism:  Mrs. Ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume, and her book is one of the books of the season.  It is edited with tact and judgment.  Prison has had an admirable effect on Mr. Wilfrid Blunt as a poet.  The _Love Sonnets of Proteus_, in spite of their clever Musset-like modernities and their swift brilliant wit, were but affected or fantastic at best.  They were simply the records of passing moods and moments, of which some were sad and others sweet, and not a few shameful.  Their subject was not of high or serious import.  They contained much that was wilful and weak.  In _Vinculis_, upon the other hand, is a book that stirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose, its lofty and impassioned thought, its depth and ardour of intense feeling.  ?Imprisonment,? says Mr. Blunt in his preface, ?is a reality of discipline most useful to the modern soul, lapped as it is in physical sloth and self-indulgence.  Like a sickness or a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles; and the soul emerges from it stronger and more self-contained.?  To him, certainly, it has been a mode of purification.  The opening sonnets, composed in the bleak cell of Galway Gaol, and written down on the flyleaves of the prisoner's prayer-book, are full of things nobly conceived and nobly uttered, and show that though Mr. Balfour may enforce ?plain living? by his prison regulations, he cannot prevent ?high thinking? or in any way limit or constrain the freedom of a man's soul.  They are, of course, intensely personal in expression.  They could not fail to be so.  But the personality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it.  The petulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of the _Love Sonnets of Proteus_ is not to be found here.  In its place we have wild grief and terrible scorn, fierce rage and flame-like passion. Such a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart and brain:  And this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is but the prelude to a larger hope:  The sonnet beginning  is very fine; and this, written just after entering the gaol, is powerful:  But, indeed, all the sonnets are worth reading, and _The Canon of Aughrim_, the longest poem in the book, is a most masterly and dramatic description of the tragic life of the Irish peasant.  Literature is not much indebted to Mr. Balfour for his sophistical _Defence of Philosophic Doubt_, which is one of the dullest books we know, but it must be admitted that by sending Mr. Blunt to gaol he has converted a clever rhymer into an earnest and deep-thinking poet.  The narrow confines of a prison cell seem to suit the 'sonnet's scanty plot of ground,? and an unjust imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the nature.  In these words Walt Whitman gives us the true attitude we should adopt towards his work, having, indeed, a much saner view of the value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy detractors can boast of possessing.  His last book, _November Boughs_, as he calls it, published in the winter of the old man's life, reveals to us, not indeed a soul's tragedy, for its last note is one of joy and hope, and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such faith, but certainly the drama of a human soul, and puts on record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his spiritual development, and of the aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his work.  His strange mode of expression is shown in these pages to have been the result of deliberate and self-conscious choice. The ?barbaric yawp? which he sent over ?the roofs of the world? so many years ago, and which wrung from Mr. Swinburne's lip such lofty panegyric in song and such loud clamorous censure in prose, appears here in what will be to many an entirely new light.  For in his very rejection of art Walt Whitman is an artist.  He tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded.  There is much method in what many have termed his madness, too much method, indeed, some may be tempted to fancy.  In the story of his life, as he tells it to us, we find him at the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature:  Edgar Allan Poe's amusing bit of dogmatism that, for our occasions and our day, ?there can be no such thing as a long poem,? fascinated him. ?The same thought had been haunting my mind before,? he said, ?but Poe's argument . . . work?d the sum out, and proved it to me,? and the English translation of the Bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic form which, while retaining the spirit of poetry, would still be free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system. Having thus, to a certain degree, settled upon what one might call the ?technique? of Whitmanism, he began to brood upon the nature of that spirit which was to give life to the strange form.  The central point of the poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily ?an identical body and soul, a personality,? in fact, which personality, he tells us frankly, ?after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself.?  However, for the true creation and revealing of this personality, at first only dimly felt, a new stimulus was needed.  This came from the Civil War.  After describing the many dreams and passions of his boyhood and early manhood, he goes on to say:  Having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and awakening of the personal self, some day to be endowed with universality, he sought to find new notes of song, and, passing beyond the mere passion for expression, he aimed at ?Suggestiveness? first.  Another ?impetus-word? is Comradeship, and other ?word-signs? are Good Cheer, Content and Hope.  Individuality, especially, he sought for:  A new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes, conceived in a natural, simple and healthy form, and he protests against poor Mr. William Rossetti's attempt to Bowdlerise and expurgate his song.  But beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence.  He desired, he says, ?to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider?d from the point of view of all, but of each.?  His two final utterances are that ?really great poetry is always . . . the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish?d and select few?; and that ?the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.?  Such are the views contained in the opening essay _A Backward Glance O?er Travel?d Roads_, as he calls it; but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume, some on poets such as Burns and Lord Tennyson, for whom Walt Whitman has a profound admiration; some on old actors and singers, the elder Booth, Forrest, Alboni and Mario being his special favourites; others on the native Indians, on the Spanish element in American nationality, on Western slang, on the poetry of the Bible, and on Abraham Lincoln.  But Walt Whitman is at his best when he is analysing his own work and making schemes for the poetry of the future. Literature, to him, has a distinctly social aim.  He seeks to build up the masses by ?building up grand individuals.?  And yet literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life.  ?The best literature is always the result of something far greater than itself?not the hero but the portrait of the hero.  Before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction.?  Certainly, in Walt Whitman's views there is a largeness of vision, a healthy sanity and a fine ethical purpose.  He is not to be placed with the professional litt?rateurs of his country, Boston novelists, New York poets and the like.  He stands apart, and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy, not in its performance.  He has begun a prelude to larger themes.  He is the herald to a new era.  As a man he is the precursor of a fresh type.  He is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being.  If Poetry has passed him by, Philosophy will take note of him.  ?The various collectors of Irish folk-lore,? says Mr. W. B. Yeats in his charming little book _Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry_, ?have, from our point of view, one great merit, and from the point of view of others, one great fault.?  Into a volume of very moderate dimensions, and of extremely moderate price, Mr. Yeats has collected together the most characteristic of our Irish folklore stories, grouping them together according to subject. First come _The Trooping Fairies_.  The peasants say that these are ?fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved, nor bad enough to be lost?; but the Irish antiquarians see in them ?the gods of pagan Ireland,? who, ?when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings, dwindled away in the popular imagination, and now are only a few spans high.?  Their chief occupations are feasting, fighting, making love, and playing the most beautiful music.  ?They have only one industrious person amongst them, the _lepra-caun_?the shoemaker.?  It is his duty to repair their shoes when they wear them out with dancing.  Mr. Yeats tells us that ?near the village of Ballisodare is a little woman who lived amongst them seven years.  When she came home she had no toes'she had danced them off.?  On May Eve, every seventh year, they fight for the harvest, for the best ears of grain belong to them.  An old man informed Mr. Yeats that he saw them fight once, and that they tore the thatch off a house. ?Had any one else been near they would merely have seen a great wind whirling everything into the air as it passed.?  When the wind drives the leaves and straws before it, ?that is the fairies, and the peasants take off their hats and say ?God bless them.??  When they are gay, they sing. Many of the most beautiful tunes of Ireland ?are only their music, caught up by eavesdroppers.?  No prudent peasant would hum _The Pretty Girl Milking the Cow_ near a fairy rath, ?for they are jealous, and do not like to hear their songs on clumsy mortal lips.?  Blake once saw a fairy's funeral.  But this, as Mr. Yeats points out, must have been an English fairy, for the Irish fairies never die; they are immortal.  Then come _The Solitary Fairies_, amongst whom we find the little _Lepracaun_ mentioned above.  He has grown very rich, as he possesses all the treasure-crocks buried in war-time.  In the early part of this century, according to Croker, they used to show in Tipperary a little shoe forgotten by the fairy shoemaker.  Then there are two rather disreputable little fairies?the _Cluricaun_, who gets intoxicated in gentlemen's cellars, and the Red Man, who plays unkind practical jokes. ?The _Fear-Gorta_ (Man of Hunger) is an emaciated phantom that goes through the land in famine time, begging an alms and bringing good luck to the giver.?  The _Water-sheerie_ is ?own brother to the English Jack-o?-Lantern.?  ?_The Leanhaun Shee_ (fairy mistress) seeks the love of mortals.  If they refuse, she must be their slave; if they consent, they are hers, and can only escape by finding another to take their place.  The fairy lives on their life, and they waste away.  Death is no escape from her.  She is the Gaelic muse, for she gives inspiration to those she persecutes.  The Gaelic poets die young, for she is restless, and will not let them remain long on earth.?  The _Pooka_ is essentially an animal spirit, and some have considered him the forefather of Shakespeare's ?Puck.?  He lives on solitary mountains, and among old ruins ?grown monstrous with much solitude,? and ?is of the race of the nightmare.?  ?He has many shapes?is now a horse, . . . now a goat, now an eagle.  Like all spirits, he is only half in the world of form.?  The _banshee_ does not care much for our democratic levelling tendencies; she loves only old families, and despises the _parvenu_ or the _nouveau riche_.  When more than one banshee is present, and they wail and sing in chorus, it is for the death of some holy or great one.  An omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is ?. . . an immense black coach, mounted by a coffin, and drawn by headless horses driven by a _Dullahan_.?  A _Dullahan_ is the most terrible thing in the world.  In 1807 two of the sentries stationed outside St. James's Park saw one climbing the railings, and died of fright.  Mr. Yeats suggests that they are possibly ?descended from that Irish giant who swam across the Channel with his head in his teeth.?  Then come the stories of ghosts, of saints and priests, and of giants. The ghosts live in a state intermediary between this world and the next. They are held there by some earthly longing or affection, or some duty unfulfilled, or anger against the living; they are those who are too good for hell, and too bad for heaven.  Sometimes they ?take the forms of insects, especially of butterflies.?  The author of the _Parochial Survey of Ireland_ ?heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, ?How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather??  On November eve they are abroad, and dance with the fairies.?  As for the saints and priests, ?there are no martyrs in the stories.?  That ancient chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis ?taunted the Archbishop of Cashel, because no one in Ireland had received the crown of martyrdom.  ?Our people may be barbarous,? the prelate answered, ?but they have never lifted their hands against God's saints; but now that a people have come amongst us who know how to make them (it was just after the English invasion), we shall have martyrs plentifully.??  The giants were the old pagan heroes of Ireland, who grew bigger and bigger, just as the gods grew smaller and smaller. The fact is they did not wait for offerings; they took them _vi et armis_.  Some of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round _T?r-na-n-Og_. This is the Country of the Young, ?for age and death have not found it; neither tears nor loud laughter have gone near it.?  ?One man has gone there and returned.  The bard, Oisen, who wandered away on a white horse, moving on the surface of the foam with his fairy Niamh, lived there three hundred years, and then returned looking for his comrades.  The moment his foot touched the earth his three hundred years fell on him, and he was bowed double, and his beard swept the ground.  He described his sojourn in the Land of Youth to Patrick before he died.?  Since then, according to Mr. Yeats, ?many have seen it in many places; some in the depths of lakes, and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells; more have seen it far off on the horizon, as they peered out from the western cliffs.  Not three years ago a fisherman imagined that he saw it.?  Mr. Yeats has certainly done his work very well.  He has shown great critical capacity in his selection of the stories, and his little introductions are charmingly written.  It is delightful to come across a collection of purely imaginative work, and Mr. Yeats has a very quick instinct in finding out the best and the most beautiful things in Irish folklore.  I am also glad to see that he has not confined himself entirely to prose, but has included Allingham's lovely poem on _The Fairies_:  All lovers of fairy tales and folklore should get this little book.  _The Horned Women_, _The Priest's Soul_, {157} and _Teig O?Kane_, are really marvellous in their way; and, indeed, there is hardly a single story that is not worth reading and thinking over.  ?_The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems_ is, I believe, the first volume of poems that Mr. Yeats has published, and it is certainly full of promise.  It must be admitted that many of the poems are too fragmentary, too incomplete.  They read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays, like things only half remembered, or, at best, but dimly seen.  But the architectonic power of construction, the power to build up and make perfect a harmonious whole, is nearly always the latest, as it certainly is the highest, development of the artistic temperament.  It is somewhat unfair to expect it in early work.  One quality Mr. Yeats has in a marked degree, a quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets, and is therefore all the more welcome to us?I mean the romantic temper.  He is essentially Celtic, and his verse, at its best, is Celtic also. Strongly influenced by Keats, he seems to study how to ?load every rift with ore,? yet is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the beauty of metrical music.  The spirit that dominates the whole book is perhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular passage, but this from _The Wanderings of Oisin_ is worth quoting.  It describes the ride to the Island of Forgetfulness:  And this, which deals with the old legend of the city lying under the waters of a lake, is strange and interesting:  Mr. Yeats has a great deal of invention, and some of the poems in his book, such as _Mosada_, _Jealousy_, and _The Island of Statues_, are very finely conceived.  It is impossible to doubt, after reading his present volume, that he will some day give us work of high import.  Up to this he has been merely trying the strings of his instrument, running over the keys.  Books of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes that are never met.  Now and then, however, one comes across a volume that is so far above the average that one can hardly resist the fascinating temptation of recklessly prophesying a fine future for its author.  Such a book Mr. Yeats's _Wanderings of Oisin_ certainly is.  Here we find nobility of treatment and nobility of subject-matter, delicacy of poetic instinct and richness of imaginative resource.  Unequal and uneven much of the work must be admitted to be.  Mr. Yeats does not try to ?out-baby? Wordsworth, we are glad to say; but he occasionally succeeds in ?out-glittering? Keats, and, here and there, in his book we come across strange crudities and irritating conceits.  But when he is at his best he is very good.  If he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment, he has at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs to the epical temper.  He does not rob of their stature the great heroes of Celtic mythology.  He is very na?ve and very primitive and speaks of his giants with the air of a child.  Here is a characteristic passage from the account of Oisin's return from the Island of Forgetfulness:  In one or two places the music is faulty, the construction is sometimes too involved, and the word ?populace? in the last line is rather infelicitous; but, when all is said, it is impossible not to feel in these stanzas the presence of the true poetic spirit.  Mr. Morris's last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginning to end, and the very remoteness of its style from the common language and ordinary interests of ou|2
12|r day gives to the whole story a strange beauty and an unfamiliar charm.  It is written in blended prose and verse, like the medi?val ?cante-fable,? and tells the tale of the House of the Wolfings in its struggles against the legionaries of Rome then advancing into Northern Germany.  It is a kind of Saga, and the language in which the folk-epic, as we may call it, is set forth recalls the antique dignity and directness of our English tongue four centuries ago.  From an artistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by a self-conscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age. Attempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art.  From some such feeling came the Pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day and the archaistic movement of later Greek sculpture.  When the result is beautiful the method is justified, and no shrill insistence upon a supposed necessity for absolute modernity of form can prevail against the value of work that has the incomparable excellence of style.  Certainly, Mr. Morris's work possesses this excellence.  His fine harmonies and rich cadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its own spirit be interpreted, awake in him something of the temper of romance and, by taking him out of his own age, place him in a truer and more vital relation to the great masterpieces of all time.  It is a bad thing for an age to be always looking in art for its own reflection.  It is well that, now and then, we are given work that is nobly imaginative in its method and purely artistic in its aim.  As we read Mr. Morris's story with its fine alternations of verse and prose, its decorative and descriptive beauties, its wonderful handling of romantic and adventurous themes, we cannot but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoble fiction as we are from the ignoble facts of our own day.  We breathe a purer air, and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of poetical quality of its own, and was simple and stately and complete.  The tragic interest of _The House of the Wolfings_ centres round the figure of Thiodolf, the great hero of the tribe.  The goddess who loves him gives him, as he goes to battle against the Romans, a magical hauberk on which rests this strange fate: that he who wears it shall save his own life and destroy the life of his land.  Thiodolf, finding out this secret, brings the hauberk back to the Wood-Sun, as she is called, and chooses death for himself rather than the ruin of his cause, and so the story ends.  But Mr. Morris has always preferred romance to tragedy, and set the development of action above the concentration of passion.  His story is like some splendid old tapestry crowded with stately images and enriched with delicate and delightful detail.  The impression it leaves on us is not of a single central figure dominating the whole, but rather of a magnificent design to which everything is subordinated, and by which everything becomes of enduring import.  It is the whole presentation of the primitive life that really fascinates.  What in other hands would have been mere arch?ology is here transformed by quick artistic instinct and made wonderful for us, and human and full of high interest.  The ancient world seems to have come to life again for our pleasure.  Of a work so large and so coherent, completed with no less perfection than it is conceived, it is difficult by mere quotation to give any adequate idea.  This, however, may serve as an example of its narrative power.  The passage describes the visit of Thiodolf to the Wood-Sun:  As an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this from the song of the Wood-Sun.  It at least shows how perfectly the poetry harmonizes with the prose, and how natural the transition is from the one to the other:  The last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great feast made for the dead is so finely written that we cannot refrain from quoting this passage:  In days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation, it is a high pleasure to welcome work of this kind.  It is a work in which all lovers of literature cannot fail to delight.  ?In modern life,? said Matthew Arnold once, ?you cannot well enter a monastery; but you can enter the Wordsworth Society.?  I fear that this will sound to many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirable and useful body, whose papers and productions have been recently published by Professor Knight, under the title of _Wordsworthiana_. ?Plain living and high thinking? are not popular ideals.  Most people prefer to live in luxury, and to think with the majority.  However, there is really nothing in the essays and addresses of the Wordsworth Society that need cause the public any unnecessary alarm; and it is gratifying to note that, although the society is still in the first blush of enthusiasm, it has not yet insisted upon our admiring Wordsworth's inferior work.  It praises what is worthy of praise, reverences what should be reverenced, and explains what does not require explanation. One paper is quite delightful; it is from the pen of Mr. Rawnsley, and deals with such reminiscences of Wordsworth as still linger among the peasantry of Westmoreland.  Mr. Rawnsley grew up, he tells us, in the immediate vicinity of the present Poet-Laureate's old home in Lincolnshire, and had been struck with the swiftness with which,  the memories of the poet of the Somersby Wold had ?faded from off the circle of the hills??had, indeed, been astonished to note how little real interest was taken in him or his fame, and how seldom his works were met with in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood. Accordingly, when he came to reside in the Lake Country, he endeavoured to find out what of Wordsworth's memory among the men of the Dales still lingered on?how far he was still a moving presence among them?how far his works had made their way into the cottages and farmhouses of the valleys. He also tried to discover how far the race of Westmoreland and Cumberland farm-folk?the ?Matthews? and the ?Michaels? of the poet, as described by him?were real or fancy pictures, or how far the characters of the Dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by tourist influences during the thirty-two years that have passed since the Lake poet was laid to rest.  With regard to the latter point, it will be remembered that Mr. Ruskin, writing in 1876, said that ?the Border peasantry, painted with absolute fidelity by Scott and Wordsworth,? are, as hitherto, a scarcely injured race; that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have fought with Henry V. at Agincourt without being distinguished from any of his knights; that he could take his tradesmen's word for a thousand pounds, and need never latch his garden gate; and that he did not fear molestation, in wood or on moor, for his girl guests.  Mr. Rawnsley, however, found that a certain beauty had vanished which the simple retirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the men among whom Wordsworth lived.  ?The strangers,? he says, ?with their gifts of gold, their vulgarity, and their requirements, have much to answer for.?  As for their impressions of Wordsworth, to understand them one must understand the vernacular of the Lake District.  ?What was Mr. Wordsworth like in personal appearance?? said Mr. Rawnsley once to an old retainer, who still lives not far from Rydal Mount.  ?He was a ugly-fa?ced man, and a me?n-liver,? was the answer; but all that was really meant was that he was a man of marked features, and led a very simple life in matters of food and raiment.  Another old man, who believed that Wordsworth ?got most of his poetry out of Hartley,? spoke of the poet's wife as ?a very onpleasant woman, very onpleasant indeed.  A close-fisted woman, that's what she was.?  This, however, seems to have been merely a tribute to Mrs. Wordsworth's admirable housekeeping qualities.  The first person interviewed by Mr. Rawnsley was an old lady who had been once in service at Rydal Mount, and was, in 1870, a lodging-house keeper at Grasmere.  She was not a very imaginative person, as may be gathered from the following anecdote:?Mr. Rawnsley's sister came in from a late evening walk, and said, ?O Mrs. D---, have you seen the wonderful sunset??  The good lady turned sharply round and, drawing herself to her full height, as if mortally offended, answered: ?No, miss; I?m a tidy cook, I know, and ?they say? a decentish body for a landlady, but I don?t knaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things, they?ve never been in my line.?  Her reminiscence of Wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as it was explanatory, from her point of view, of the method in which Wordsworth composed, and was helped in his labours by his enthusiastic sister.  ?Well, you know,? she said, ?Mr. Wordsworth went humming and booing about, and she, Miss Dorothy, kept close behint him, and she picked up the bits as he let ?em fall, and tak? ?em down, and put ?em together on paper for him.  And you may be very well sure as how she didn?t understand nor make sense out of ?em, and I doubt that he didn?t know much about them either himself, but, howivver, there's a great many folk as do, I dare say.?  Of Wordsworth's habit of talking to himself, and composing aloud, we hear a great deal.  ?Was Mr. Wordsworth a sociable man?? asked Mr. Rawnsley of a Rydal farmer.  ?Wudsworth, for a? he had noa pride nor nowt,? was the answer, ?was a man who was quite one to hissel, ye kna.  He was not a man as folks could crack wi?, nor not a man as could crack wi? folks.  But there was another thing as kep? folk off, he had a ter?ble girt deep voice, and ye might see his faace agaan for long enuff.  I?ve knoan folks, village lads and lasses, coming over by old road above, which runs from Grasmere to Rydal, flayt a?most to death there by Wishing Gaate to hear the girt voice a groanin? and mutterin? and thunderin? of a still evening.  And he had a way of standin? quite still by the rock there in t? path under Rydal, and folks could hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks, and childer were scared fit to be dead a?most.?  But the corroboration comes in strange guise.  Mr. Rawnsley asked one of the Dalesmen about Wordsworth's dress and habits.  This was the reply: ?Wudsworth wore a Jem Crow, never seed him in a boxer in my life,?a Jem Crow and an old blue cloak was his rig, and _as for his habits_, _he had noan_; niver knew him with a pot i? his hand, or a pipe i? his mouth. But he was a gre?t skater, for a? that?noan better in these parts?why, he could cut his own na?me upo? the ice, could Mr. Wudsworth.?  Skating seems to have been Wordsworth's one form of amusement.  He was ?over feckless i? his hands??could not drive or ride??not a bit of fish in him,? and ?nowt of a mountaineer.?  But he could skate.  The rapture of the time when, as a boy, on Esthwaite's frozen lake, he had  was continued, Mr. Rawnsley tells us, into manhood's later day; and Mr. Rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained, when  was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt.  The recollection of a fall he once had, when his skate caught on a stone, still lingers in the district.  A boy had been sent to sweep the snow from the White Moss Tarn for him.  ?Did Mr. Wudsworth gie ye owt?? he was asked, when he returned from his labour.  ?Na, but I seed him tumlle, though!? was the answer.  ?He was a ter?ble girt skater, was Wudsworth now,? says one of Mr. Rawnsley's informants; ?he would put one hand i? his breast (he wore a frill shirt i? them days), and t? other hand i? his waistband, same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm, and he would stand up straight and sway and swing away grandly.?  Of his poetry they did not think much, and whatever was good in it they ascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge.  He wrote poetry, they said, ?because he couldn?t help it?because it was his hobby??for sheer love, and not for money.  They could not understand his doing work ?for nowt,? and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem because it did not bring in ?a deal o? brass to the pocket.?  ?Did you ever read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses?? asked Mr. Rawnsley.  The answer was curious: ?Ay, ay, time or two.  But ya?re weel aware there's potry and potry.  There's potry wi? a li?le bit pleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer understand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what's said, and a deal of Wudsworth's was this sort, ye kna.  You could tell fra the man's faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it.  His potry was quite different work from li?le Hartley.  Hartley ?ud goa running along beside o? the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door and write what he had got upo? paper.  But Wudsworth's potry was real hard stuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he?d keep it in his head for long enough.  Eh, but it's queer, mon, different ways folks hes of making potry now. . . .  Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn?t stand very high, and was a well-spoken man enough.?  The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr. Rawnsley heard was this: ?He was an open-air man, and a great critic of trees.?  There are many useful and well-written essays in Professor Knight's volume, but Mr. Rawnsley's is far the most interesting of all.  It gives us a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and manner to those about whom he wrote.  Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and very poisonous poetry.  Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, and cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on earth.  Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden of _Bothwell_.  Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about children of a somewhat over-subtle character.  He is now extremely patriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection for the Tory party.  He has always been a great poet.  But he has his limitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of any sense of limit.  His song is nearly always too loud for his subject. His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volume that now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals.  It has been said of him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with still greater truth it may be said that Language is his master.  Words seem to dominate him.  Alliteration tyrannizes over him.  Mere sound often becomes his lord.  He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes unreal.  Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:  Somehow we seem to have heard all this before.  Does it come from the fact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who is the most limited in imagery?  It must be admitted that he is so.  He has wearied us with his monotony.  ?Fire? and the ?Sea? are the two words ever on his lips.  We must confess also that this shrill singing?marvellous as it is?leaves us out of breath.  Here is a passage from a poem called _A Word with the Wind_:  Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and vigour of its metrical scheme.  Its purely technical excellence is extraordinary.  But is it more than an oratorical _tour de force_?  Does it really convey much?  Does it charm?  Could we return to it again and again with renewed pleasure?  We think not.  It seems to us empty.  Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human life.  To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne's aim. He seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave.  The roar of the fire is ever in his ears.  He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids her blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret. He is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of his own personality, and he has succeeded.  We hear the song, but we never know the singer.  We never even get near to him.  Out of the thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing.  We have often had man's interpretation of Nature; now we have Nature's interpretation of man, and she has curiously little to say.  Force and Freedom form her vague message.  She deafens us with her clangours.  But Mr. Swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out of the depths of the sea.  Romantic ballads in Border dialect have not lost their fascination for him, and this last volume contains some very splendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry.  The amount of pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament. To say ?mither? instead of ?mother? seems to many the acme of romance. There are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of provincialism.  There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne's mastery over the form, whether the form be quite legitimate or not.  _The __Weary Wedding_ has the concentration and colour of a great drama, and the quaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque. The ballad of _The Witch-Mother_, a medi?val Medea who slays her children because her lord is faithless, is worth reading on account of its horrible simplicity.  _The Bride's Tragedy_, with its strange refrain of  _The Tyneside Widow_ and _A Reiver's Neck-verse_ are all poems of fine imaginative power, and some of them are terrible in their fierce intensity of passion.  There is no danger of English poetry narrowing itself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect.  It is of too vital a growth for that.  So we may welcome Mr. Swinburne's masterly experiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not be imitated.  The collection is completed by a few poems on children, some sonnets, a threnody on John William Inchbold, and a lovely lyric entitled _The Interpreters_.  Certainly, ?for song's sake? we should love Mr. Swinburne's work, cannot, indeed, help loving it, so marvellous a music-maker is he.  But what of the soul?  For the soul we must go elsewhere.  An eminent Oxford theologian once remarked that his only objection to modern progress was that it progressed forward instead of backward?a view that so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptly wrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development of ideas and the movements of the common sea-crab.  I feel sure the _Speaker_ will not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of holding this dangerous heresy of retrogression.  But I must candidly admit that I have come to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism of modern life I have met with for some time is that contained in the writings of the learned Chuang Tz?, recently translated into the vulgar tongue by Mr. Herbert Giles, Her Majesty's Consul at Tamsui.  The spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of this great thinker quite familiar to the general public, but, for the sake of the few and the over-cultured, I feel it my duty to state definitely who he was, and to give a brief outline of the character of his philosophy.  Chuang Tz?, whose name must carefully be pronounced as it is not written, was born in the fourth century before Christ, by the banks of the Yellow River, in the Flowery Land; and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple tea-trays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban households.  The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him.  If they really knew who he was, they would tremble.  Chuang Tz? spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all useful things.  ?Do nothing, and everything will be done,? was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master Lao Tz?. To resolve action into thought, and thought into abstraction, was his wicked transcendental aim.  Like the obscure philosopher of early Greek speculation, he believed in the identity of contraries; like Plato, he was an idealist, and had all the idealist's contempt for utilitarian systems; he was a mystic like Dionysius, and Scotus Erigena, and Jacob B?hme, and held, with them and with Philo, that the object of life was to get rid of self-consciousness, and to become the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination.  In fact, Chuang Tz? may be said to have summed up in himself almost every mood of European metaphysical or mystical thought, from Heraclitus down to Hegel.  There was something in him of the Quietist also; and in his worship of Nothing he may be said to have in some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of medi?val days who, like Tauler and Master Eckhart, adored the _purum nihil_ and the Abyss. The great middle classes of this country, to whom, as we all know, our prosperity, if not our civilization, is entirely due, may shrug their shoulders over all this and ask, with a certain amount of reason, what is the identity of contraries to them, and why they should get rid of that self-consciousness which is their chief characteristic.  But Chuang Tz? was something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist.  He sought to destroy society, as we know it, as the middle classes know it; and the sad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a Rousseau the scientific reasoning of a Herbert Spencer.  There is nothing of the sentimentalist in him.  He pities the rich more than the poor, if he even pities at all, and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering.  He has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures, nor does he propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to those who come in last in the race.  It is the race itself that he objects to; and as for active sympathy, which has become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day, he thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation as ?beating a drum in a forest in order to find a fugitive.?  It is a mere waste of energy.  That is all. While, as for a thoroughly sympathetic man, he is, in the eyes of Chuang Tz?, simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else, and so misses the only possible excuse for his own existence.  Yes; incredible as it may seem, this curious thinker looked back with a sigh of regret to a certain Golden Age when there were no competitive examinations, no wearisome educational systems, no missionaries, no penny dinners for the people, no Established Churches, no Humanitarian Societies, no dull lectures about one's duty to one's neighbour, and no tedious sermons about any subject at all.  In those ideal days, he tells us, people loved each other without being conscious of charity, or writing to the newspapers about it.  They were upright, and yet they never published books upon Altruism.  As every man kept his knowledge to himself, the world escaped the curse of scepticism; and as every man kept his virtues to himself, nobody meddled in other people's business.  They lived simple and peaceful lives, and were contented with such food and raiment as they could get.  Neighbouring districts were in sight, and ?the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in the other,? yet the people grew old and died without ever interchanging visits.  There was no chattering about clever men, and no laudation of good men.  The intolerable sense of obligation was unknown.  The deeds of humanity left no trace, and their affairs were not made a burden for prosperity by foolish historians.  In an evil moment the Philanthropist made his appearance, and brought with him the mischievous idea of Government.  ?There is such a thing,? says Chuang Tz?, ?as leaving mankind alone: there has never been such a thing as governing mankind.?  All modes of government are wrong.  They are unscientific, because they seek to alter the natural environment of man; they are immoral because, by interfering with the individual, they produce the most aggressive forms of egotism; they are ignorant, because they try to spread education; they are self-destructive, because they engender anarchy.  ?Of old,? he tells us, ?the Yellow Emperor first caused charity and duty to one's neighbour to interfere with the natural goodness of the heart of man.  In consequence of this, Yao and Shun wore the hair off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people.  They disturbed their internal economy in order to find room for artificial virtues.  They exhausted their energies in framing laws, and they were failures.?  Man's heart, our philosopher goes on to say, may be ?forced down or stirred up,? and in either case the issue is fatal.  Yao made the people too happy, so they were not satisfied.  Chieh made them too wretched, so they grew discontented.  Then every one began to argue about the best way of tinkering up society.  ?It is quite clear that something must be done,? they said to each other, and there was a general rush for knowledge.  The results were so dreadful that the Government of the day had to bring in Coercion, and as a consequence of this ?virtuous men sought refuge in mountain caves, while rulers of state sat trembling in ancestral halls.?  Then, when everything was in a state of perfect chaos, the Social Reformers got up on platforms, and preached salvation from the ills that they and their system had caused.  The poor Social Reformers! ?They know not shame, nor what it is to blush,? is the verdict of Chuang Tz? upon them.  The economic question, also, is discussed by this almond-eyed sage at great length, and he writes about the curse of capital as eloquently as Mr. Hyndman.  The accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil. It makes the strong violent, and the weak dishonest.  It creates the petty thief, and puts him in a bamboo cage.  It creates the big thief, and sets him on a throne of white jade.  It is the father of competition, and competition is the waste, as well as the destruction, of energy.  The order of nature is rest, repetition, and peace.  Weariness and war are the results of an artificial society based upon capital; and the richer this society gets, the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is, for it has neither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments for the wicked.  There is also this to be remembered?that the prizes of the world degrade a man as much as the world's punishments.  The age is rotten with its worship of success.  As for education, true wisdom can neither be learnt nor taught.  It is a spiritual state, to which he who lives in harmony with nature attains.  Knowledge is shallow if we compare it with the extent of the unknown, and only the unknowable is of value. Society produces rogues, and education makes one rogue cleverer than another.  That is the only result of School Boards.  Besides, of what possible philosophic importance can education be, when it serves simply to make each man differ from his neighbour?  We arrive ultimately at a chaos of opinions, doubt everything, and fall into the vulgar habit of arguing; and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Look at Hui Tzu.  ?He was a man of many ideas.  His work would fill five carts. But his doctrines were paradoxical.?  He said that there were feathers in an egg, because there were feathers on a chicken; that a dog could be a sheep, because all names were arbitrary; that there was a moment when a swift-flying arrow was neither moving nor at rest; that if you took a stick a foot long, and cut it in half every day, you would never come to the end of it; and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three, because taken separately they were two, and taken together they were one, and one and two made up three.  ?He was like a man running a race with his own shadow, and making a noise in order to drown the echo.  He was a clever gadfly, that was all.  What was the use of him??  Morality is, of course, a different thing.  It went out of fashion, says Chuang Tz?, when people began to moralize.  Men ceased then to be spontaneous and to act on intuition.  They became priggish and artificial, and were so blind as to have a definite purpose in life. Then came Governments and Philanthropists, those two pests of the age. The former tried to coerce people into being good, and so destroyed the|2
13| natural goodness of man.  The latter were a set of aggressive busybodies who caused confusion wherever they went.  They were stupid enough to have principles, and unfortunate enough to act up to them.  They all came to bad ends, and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results as universal egotism.  ?They tripped people up over charity, and fettered them with duties to their neighbours.?  They gushed over music, and fussed over ceremonies.  As a consequence of all this, the world lost its equilibrium, and has been staggering ever since.  Who, then, according to Chuang Tz?, is the perfect man?  And what is his manner of life?  The perfect man does nothing beyond gazing at the universe.  He adopts no absolute position.  ?In motion, he is like water. At rest, he is like a mirror.  And, like Echo, he answers only when he is called upon.?  He lets externals take care of themselves.  Nothing material injures him; nothing spiritual punishes him.  His mental equilibrium gives him the empire of the world.  He is never the slave of objective existences.  He knows that, ?just as the best language is that which is never spoken, so the best action is that which is never done.? He is passive, and accepts the laws of life.  He rests in inactivity, and sees the world become virtuous of itself.  He does not try to ?bring about his own good deeds.?  He never wastes himself on effort.  He is not troubled about moral distinctions.  He knows that things are what they are, and that their consequences will be what they will be.  His mind is the 'speculum of creation,? and he is ever at peace.  All this is of course excessively dangerous, but we must remember that Chuang Tz? lived more than two thousand years ago, and never had the opportunity of seeing our unrivalled civilization.  And yet it is possible that, were he to come back to earth and visit us, he might have something to say to Mr. Balfour about his coercion and active misgovernment in Ireland; he might smile at some of our philanthropic ardours, and shake his head over many of our organized charities; the School Board might not impress him, nor our race for wealth stir his admiration; he might wonder at our ideals, and grow sad over what we have realized.  Perhaps it is well that Chuang Tz? cannot return.  Meanwhile, thanks to Mr. Giles and Mr. Quaritch, we have his book to console us, and certainly it is a most fascinating and delightful volume. Chuang Tz? is one of the Darwinians before Darwin.  He traces man from the germ, and sees his unity with nature.  As an anthropologist he is excessively interesting, and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor living in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself, and knowing only one parent, the mother, with all the accuracy of a lecturer at the Royal Society.  Like Plato, he adopts the dialogue as his mode of expression, ?putting words into other people's mouths,? he tells us, ?in order to gain breadth of view.?  As a story-teller he is charming.  The account of the visit of the respectable Confucius to the great Robber Ch? is most vivid and brilliant, and it is impossible not to laugh over the ultimate discomfiture of the sage, the barrenness of whose moral platitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand.  Even in his metaphysics, Chuang Tz? is intensely humorous.  He personifies his abstractions, and makes them act plays before us.  The Spirit of the Clouds, when passing eastward through the expanse of air, happened to fall in with the Vital Principle.  The latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about: whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said, ?Who are you, old man, and what are you doing??  ?Strolling!? replied the Vital Principle, without stopping, for all activities are ceaseless.  ?I want to _know_ something,? continued the Spirit of the Clouds.  ?Ah!? cried the Vital Principle, in a tone of disapprobation, and a marvellous conversation follows, that is not unlike the dialogue between the Sphinx and the Chimera in Flaubert's curious drama.  Talking animals, also, have their place in Chuang Tz?'s parables and stories, and through myth and poetry and fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance.  Of course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be consciously good, and that doing anything is the worst form of idleness.  Thousands of excellent and really earnest philanthropists would be absolutely thrown upon the rates if we adopted the view that nobody should be allowed to meddle in what does not concern him.  The doctrine of the uselessness of all useful things would not merely endanger our commercial supremacy as a nation, but might bring discredit upon many prosperous and serious-minded members of the shop-keeping classes.  What would become of our popular preachers, our Exeter Hall orators, our drawing-room evangelists, if we said to them, in the words of Chuang Tz?, ?Mosquitoes will keep a man awake all night with their biting, and just in the same way this talk of charity and duty to one's neighbour drives us nearly crazy.  Sirs, strive to keep the world to its own original simplicity, and, as the wind bloweth where it listeth, so let Virtue establish itself.  Wherefore this undue energy??  And what would be the fate of governments and professional politicians if we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as governing mankind at all?  It is clear that Chuang Tz? is a very dangerous writer, and the publication of his book in English, two thousand years after his death, is obviously premature, and may cause a great deal of pain to many thoroughly respectable and industrious persons.  It may be true that the ideal of self-culture and self-development, which is the aim of his scheme of life, and the basis of his scheme of philosophy, is an ideal somewhat needed by an age like ours, in which most people are so anxious to educate their neighbours that they have actually no time left in which to educate themselves.  But would it be wise to say so?  It seems to me that if we once admitted the force of any one of Chuang Tz?'s destructive criticisms we should have to put some check on our national habit of self-glorification; and the only thing that ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praise he always gives himself for doing them.  There may, however, be a few who have grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that sets enthusiasm to do the work of the intellect.  To these, and such as these, Chuang Tz? will be welcome.  But let them only read him.  Let them not talk about him.  He would be disturbing at dinner-parties, and impossible at afternoon teas, and his whole life was a protest against platform speaking.  ?The perfect man ignores self; the divine man ignores action; the true sage ignores reputation.?  These are the principles of Chuang Tz?.  When I first had the privilege?and I count it a very high one?of meeting Mr. Walter Pater, he said to me, smiling, ?Why do you always write poetry?  Why do you not write prose?  Prose is so much more difficult.?  It was during my undergraduate days at Oxford; days of lyrical ardour and of studious sonnet-writing; days when one loved the exquisite intricacy and musical repetitions of the ballade, and the villanelle with its linked long-drawn echoes and its curious completeness; days when one solemnly sought to discover the proper temper in which a triolet should be written; delightful days, in which, I am glad to say, there was far more rhyme than reason.  I may frankly confess now that at the time I did not quite comprehend what Mr. Pater really meant; and it was not till I had carefully studied his beautiful and suggestive essays on the Renaissance that I fully realized what a wonderful self-conscious art the art of English prose-writing really is, or may be made to be.  Carlyle's stormy rhetoric, Ruskin's winged and passionate eloquence, had seemed to me to spring from enthusiasm rather than from art.  I do not think I knew then that even prophets correct their proofs.  As for Jacobean prose, I thought it too exuberant; and Queen Anne prose appeared to me terribly bald, and irritatingly rational.  But Mr. Pater's essays became to me ?the golden book of spirit and sense, the holy writ of beauty.?  They are still this to me.  It is possible, of course, that I may exaggerate about them.  I certainly hope that I do; for where there is no exaggeration there is no love, and where there is no love there is no understanding. It is only about things that do not interest one, that one can give a really unbiassed opinion; and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always valueless.  But I must not allow this brief notice of Mr. Pater's new volume to degenerate into an autobiography.  I remember being told in America that whenever Margaret Fuller wrote an essay upon Emerson the printers had always to send out to borrow some additional capital ?I's,? and I feel it right to accept this transatlantic warning.  _Appreciations_, in the fine Latin sense of the word, is the title given by Mr. Pater to his book, which is an exquisite collection of exquisite essays, of delicately wrought works of art'some of them being almost Greek in their purity of outline and perfection of form, others medi?val in their strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion, and all of them absolutely modern, in the true meaning of the term modernity.  For he to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives.  To realize the nineteenth century one must realize every century that has preceded it, and that has contributed to its making.  To know anything about oneself, one must know all about others.  There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathize, no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive.  The legacies of heredity may make us alter our views of moral responsibility, but they cannot but intensify our sense of the value of Criticism; for the true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional impulse obscure.  Perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the least successful, of the essays contained in the present volume is that on _Style_.  It is the most interesting because it is the work of one who speaks with the high authority that comes from the noble realization of things nobly conceived.  It is the least successful, because the subject is too abstract.  A true artist like Mr. Pater is most felicitous when he deals with the concrete, whose very limitations give him finer freedom, while they necessitate more intense vision.  And yet what a high ideal is contained in these few pages!  How good it is for us, in these days of popular education and facile journalism, to be reminded of the real scholarship that is essential to the perfect writer, who, ?being a true lover of words for their own sake, a minute and constant observer of their physiognomy,? will avoid what is mere rhetoric, or ostentatious ornament, or negligent misuse of terms, or ineffective surplusage, and will be known by his tact of omission, by his skilful economy of means, by his selection and self-restraint, and perhaps above all by that conscious artistic structure which is the expression of mind in style.  I think I have been wrong in saying that the subject is too abstract.  In Mr. Pater's hands it becomes very real to us indeed, and he shows us how, behind the perfection of a man's style, must lie the passion of a man's soul.  As one passes to the rest of the volume, one finds essays on Wordsworth and on Coleridge, on Charles Lamb and on Sir Thomas Browne, on some of Shakespeare's plays and on the English kings that Shakespeare fashioned, on Dante Rossetti, and on William Morris.  As that on Wordsworth seems to be Mr. Pater's last work, so that on the singer of the _Defence of Guenevere_ is certainly his earliest, or almost his earliest, and it is interesting to mark the change that has taken place in his style.  This change is, perhaps, at first sight not very apparent.  In 1868 we find Mr. Pater writing with the same exquisite care for words, with the same studied music, with the same temper, and something of the same mode of treatment.  But, as he goes on, the architecture of the style becomes richer and more complex, the epithet more precise and intellectual. Occasionally one may be inclined to think that there is, here and there, a sentence which is somewhat long, and possibly, if one may venture to say so, a little heavy and cumbersome in movement.  But if this be so, it comes from those side-issues suddenly suggested by the idea in its progress, and really revealing the idea more perfectly; or from those felicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme, and yet convey something of the charm of chance; or from a desire to suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulating effect, and to avoid, it may be, the violence and harshness of too definite and exclusive an opinion.  For in matters of art, at any rate, thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than fixed, and, recognizing its dependence upon the moods and upon the passion of fine moments, will not accept the rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma.  The critical pleasure, too, that we receive from tracing, through what may seem the intricacies of a sentence, the working of the constructive intelligence, must not be overlooked.  As soon as we have realized the design, everything appears clear and simple.  After a time, these long sentences of Mr. Pater's come to have the charm of an elaborate piece of music, and the unity of such music also.  I have suggested that the essay on Wordsworth is probably the most recent bit of work contained in this volume.  If one might choose between so much that is good, I should be inclined to say it is the finest also. The essay on Lamb is curiously suggestive; suggestive, indeed, of a somewhat more tragic, more sombre figure, than men have been wont to think of in connection with the author of the _Essays of Elia_.  It is an interesting aspect under which to regard Lamb, but perhaps he himself would have had some difficulty in recognizing the portrait given of him. He had, undoubtedly, great sorrows, or motives for sorrow, but he could console himself at a moment's notice for the real tragedies of life by reading any one of the Elizabethan tragedies, provided it was in a folio edition.  The essay on Sir Thomas Browne is delightful, and has the strange, personal, fanciful charm of the author of the _Religio Medici_, Mr. Pater often catching the colour and accent and tone of whatever artist, or work of art, he deals with.  That on Coleridge, with its insistence on the necessity of the cultivation of the relative, as opposed to the absolute spirit in philosophy and in ethics, and its high appreciation of the poet's true position in our literature, is in style and substance a very blameless work.  Grace of expression and delicate subtlety of thought and phrase, characterize the essays on Shakespeare. But the essay on Wordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own.  It appeals, not to the ordinary Wordsworthian with his uncritical temper, and his gross confusion of ethical and 'sthetical problems, but rather to those who desire to separate the gold from the dross, and to reach at the true Wordsworth through the mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears his name, and that serves often to conceal him from us.  The presence of an alien element in Wordsworth's art is, of course, recognized by Mr. Pater, but he touches on it merely from the psychological point of view, pointing out how this quality of higher and lower moods gives the effect in his poetry ?of a power not altogether his own, or under his control?; a power which comes and goes when it wills, 'so that the old fancy which made the poet's art an enthusiasm, a form of divine possession, seems almost true of him.?  Mr. Pater's earlier essays had their _purpurei panni_, so eminently suitable for quotation, such as the famous passage on _Mona Lisa_, and that other in which Botticelli's strange conception of the Virgin is so strangely set forth.  From the present volume it is difficult to select any one passage in preference to another as specially characteristic of Mr. Pater's treatment.  This, however, is worth quoting at length.  It contains a truth eminently suitable for our age:  Certainly the real secret of Wordsworth has never been better expressed. After having read and reread Mr. Pater's essay?for it requires re-reading?one returns to the poet's work with a new sense of joy and wonder, and with something of eager and impassioned expectation.  And perhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the finest criticism.  Finally, one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that has gone to fashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful volume.  The difference between the classical and romantic spirits in art has often, and with much over-emphasis, been discussed.  But with what a light sure touch does Mr. Pater write of it!  How subtle and certain are his distinctions!  If imaginative prose be really the special art of this century, Mr. Pater must rank amongst our century's most characteristic artists.  In certain things he stands almost alone.  The age has produced wonderful prose styles, turbid with individualism, and violent with excess of rhetoric.  But in Mr. Pater, as in Cardinal Newman, we find the union of personality with perfection.  He has no rival in his own sphere, and he has escaped disciples.  And this, not because he has not been imitated, but because in art so fine as his there is something that, in its essence, is inimitable.  Perhaps he will write poetry some day.  If he does we would earnestly appeal to him to give up calling a cock ?proud chanticleer.?  Few synonyms are so depressing.  A young writer can gain more from the study of a literary poet than from the study of a lyrist.  I have seen many audiences more interesting than the actors, and have often heard better dialogue in the _foyer_ than I have on the stage.  The Dramatic College might take up the education of spectators as well as that of players, and teach people that there is a proper moment for the throwing of flowers as well as a proper method.  Life remains eternally unchanged; it is art which, by presenting it to us under various forms, enables us to realize its many-sided mysteries, and to catch the quality of its most fiery-coloured moments.  The originality, I mean, which we ask from the artist, is originality of treatment, not of subject.  It is only the unimaginative who ever invents.  The true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes, and he annexes everything.  If I ventured on a bit of advice, which I feel most reluctant to do, it would be to the effect that while one should always study the method of a great artist, one should never imitate his manner.  The manner of an artist is essentially individual, the method of an artist is absolutely universal.  The first is personality, which no one should copy; the second is perfection, which all should aim at.  A critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me that no one ever went out hunting when roses were in full bloom.  Personally, that is exactly the season I would select for the chase, but then I know more about flowers than I do about foxes, and like them much better.  The nineteenth century may be a prosaic age, but we fear that, if we are to judge by the general run of novels, it is not an age of prose.  Perhaps in this century we are too altruistic to be really artistic.  I am led to hope that the University will some day have a theatre of its own, and that proficiency in scene-painting will be regarded as a necessary qualification for the Slade Professorship.  On the stage, literature returns to life and arch?ology becomes art.  A fine theatre is a temple where all the muses may meet, a second Parnassus.  It would be sad indeed if the many volumes of poems that are every year published in London found no readers but the authors themselves and the authors? relations; and the real philanthropist should recognize it as part of his duties to buy every new book of verse that appears.  A fifteen-line sonnet is as bad a monstrosity as a sonnet in dialogue.  Antiquarian books, as a rule, are extremely dull reading.  They give us facts without form, science without style, and learning without life.  The Roman patron, in fact, kept the Roman poet alive, and we fancy that many of our modern bards rather regret the old system.  Better, surely, the humiliation of the _sportula_ than the indignity of a bill for printing!  Better to accept a country-house as a gift than to be in debt to one's landlady!  On the whole, the patron was an excellent institution, if not for poetry at least for the poets; . . . every poet longs for a M?cenas.  The two things the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and music of voice.  Indeed, to gain these virtues their actors used to subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular regime of diet, health being to the Greeks not merely a quality of art, but a condition of its production.  One should not be too severe on English novels: they are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed.  Most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their culture.  Not that a tramp's mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of the poetic faculty.  Far from it!  He, if any one, should possess that freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist, for he has no taxes to pay and no relations to worry him.  The man who possesses a permanent address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is necessarily limited and localized.  Only the tramp has absolute liberty of living. Was not Homer himself a vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a caravan?  In art as in life the law of heredity holds good.  _On est toujours fils de quelqu?un_.  He has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from him?a very difficult thing to do.  Morocco is a sort of paradox among countries, for though it lies westward of Piccadilly, yet it is purely Oriental in character, and though it is but three hours? sail from Europe, yet it makes you feel (to use the forcible expression of an American writer) as if you had been taken up by the scruff of the neck and set down in the Old Testament.  As children themselves are the perfect flowers of life, so a collection of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all anthologies.  No English poet has written of children with more love and grace and delicacy [than Herrick].  His _Ode on the Birth of Our Saviour_, his poem _To His Saviour_, _A Child_: _A Present by a Child_, his _Graces for Children_, and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them exquisite works of art, simple, sweet and sincere.  As the cross-benches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take to Homeric studies.  Many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with Achilles after some violent political crisis and, enraged at the fickleness of fortune, more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant for party.  There are two ways of misunderstanding a poem.  One is to misunderstand it and the other to praise it for qualities it does not possess.  Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event.  It is true that such aphorisms as  can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry, still, they are preferable, on the whole, to the date of Hannah More's birth, or of the burning down of Exeter Change, or of the opening of the Great Exhibition; and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis of Culture, we should all be much improved if we began each day with a fine passage of English poetry.  Even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing.  Prefixed to the Calendar is an introductory note . . . displaying that intimate acquaintance with Sappho's lost poems which is the privilege only of those who are not acquainted with Greek literature.  Mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities; it is in their reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief.  All premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves.  No one survives being over-estimated.  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was one of the first true men of letters America produced, and as such deserves a high place in any history of American civilization.  To a land out of breath in its greed for gain he showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature; his lectures, though not by any means brilliant, were still productive of much good; he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote some pretty poems.  But his poems are not of the kind that call for intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or, indeed, for any serious discussion at all.  Though the _Psalm of Life_ be shouted from Maine to California, that would not make it true poetry.  Longfellow has no imitators, for of echoes themselves there are no echoes and it is only style that makes a school.  Poe's marvellous lines _To Helen_, a poem as beautiful as a Greek gem and as musical as Apollo's lute.  Good novelists are much rarer than good sons, and none of us would part readily with Micawber and Mrs. Nickleby.  Still, the fact remains that a man who was affectionate and loving to his children, generous and warm-hearted to his friends, and whose books are the very bacchanalia of benevolence, pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh, and this fact every biographer of Dickens should face and, if possible, explain.  No age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor.  What we do not know about Shakespeare is a most fascinating subject, and one that would fill a volume, but what we do know about him is so meagre and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather depressing.  They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study.  Rossetti's was a great personality, and personalities such as his do not easily survive shilling primers.  We are sorry to find an English dramatic critic misquoting Shakespeare, as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved specially for our English actors.  Biographies of this kind rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder, add to death itself a new terror, and make one wish that all art were anonymous.  A pillar of fire to the few who knew him, and of cloud to the many who knew him not, Dante Gabriel Rossetti lived apart from the gossip and tittle-tattle of a shallow age.  He never trafficked with the merchants for his soul, nor brought his wares into the market-place for the idle to gape at.  Passionate and romantic though he was, yet there was in his nature something of high austerity.  He loved seclusion, and hated notoriety, and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular biographies, sandwiched between the author of _Pickwick_ and the Great Lexicographer.  We sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published, as the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling.  The only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of place is history.  In novels they are detestable.  Shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without ever appealing to our imagination.  Pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in art, as in politics, there is a great future for monsters.  It is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be misunderstood.  As truly religious people are resigned to everything, even to mediocre poetry, there is no reason at all why Madame Guyon's verses should not be popular with a large section of the community.  A simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle.  Such novels as _Scamp_ are possibly more easy to write than they are to read.  We have no doubt that when Bailey wrote to Lord Houghton that common-sense and gentleness were Keats's tw|2
14|o special characteristics the worthy Archdeacon meant extremely well, but we prefer the real Keats, with his passionate wilfulness, his fantastic moods and his fine inconsistence.  Part of Keats's charm as a man is his fascinating incompleteness.  The Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to teach, is no longer applicable to a society such as ours, with its solidarity of interests, its recognition of natural rights, and its universal education, however suitable it may have been to the Greek cities under Roman rule.  Nothing in the United States struck me more than the fact that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely due to the efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful magazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every question of public interest, and exercise an important influence upon the growth and tendencies of literature and art.  Indeed, the women of America are the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so necessary for culture.  The men are, as a rule, so absorbed in business, that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent Bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture of his country would be in petticoats.  By that time, however, it is probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated, as similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits.  The aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in Sheridan, is to mirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of its day, and the censure of the Puritan, whether real or affected, is always out of place in literary criticism, and shows a want of recognition of the essential distinction between art and life.  After all, it is only the Philistine who thinks of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his cowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is very little use in airing one's moral sense at the expense of one's artistic appreciation.  The _?neid_ bears almost the same relation to the _Iliad_ that the _Idylls of the King_ do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur.  Like them it is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity or the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, ?neas is no less a failure than Arthur.  There is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate impossible virtues.  As far as the serious presentation of life is concerned, what we require is more imaginative treatment, greater freedom from theatric language and theatric convention.  It may be questioned, also, whether the consistent reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature.  True originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in the rejection of all models and masters.  _Dans l?art comme dans la nature on est toujours fils de quelqu?un_, and we should not quarrel with the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre.  A little child once asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing.  In France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented the modern method of looking at life; and one great artist, Flaubert, who is the impeccable master of style; and to the influence of these two men we may trace almost all contemporary French fiction.  But in England we have had no schools worth speaking of.  The fiery torch lit by the Bront's has not been passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only journalism; Thackeray's delightful superficial philosophy, superb narrative power, and clever social satire have found no echoes; nor has Trollope left any direct successors behind him?a fact which is not much to be regretted, however, as, admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy afternoons and tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of literature he is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva.  George Meredith's style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning.  As a writer he has mastered everything, except language; as a novelist he can do everything, except tell a story; as an artist he is everything, except articulate.  Too strange to be popular, too individual to have imitators, the author of _Richard Feverel_ stands absolutely alone.  It is easy to disarm criticism, but he has disarmed the disciple. He gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit, and is never so pathetic as when he is humorous.  To turn truth into a paradox is not difficult, but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no Theseus can thread his labyrinth, no ?dipus solve his secret.  The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets once remarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that no one can live for three days without poetry.  This, however, can hardly be said to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiously uncommon quality which is called common-sense.  I fancy that most people, if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like their culture to repose on a basis of good cookery.  A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no little poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is an admirable thing.  This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the subject.  Little poets are an extremely interesting study.  The best of them have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of them may bore yet they rarely brutalize.  It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a bad translator.  We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for.  In one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result is extremely depressing.  is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry.  Mr. Griffiths should beware of originality.  Like beauty, it is a fatal gift.  There is a wide difference between the beautiful Tuscan city and the sea-city of the Adriatic.  Florence is a city full of memories of the great figures of the past.  The traveller cannot pass along her streets without treading in the very traces of Dante, without stepping on soil made memorable by footprints never to be effaced.  The greatness of the surroundings, the palaces, churches, and frowning medi?val castles in the midst of the city, are all thrown into the background by the greatness, the individuality, the living power and vigour of the men who are their originators, and at the same time their inspiring soul.  But when we turn to Venice the effect is very different.  We do not think of the makers of that marvellous city, but rather of what they made.  The idealized image of Venice herself meets us everywhere.  The mother is not overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her sons.  In her records the city is everything?the republic, the worshipped ideal of a community in which every man for the common glory seems to have been willing to sink his own.  We know that Dante stood within the red walls of the arsenal, and saw the galleys making and mending, and the pitch flaming up to heaven; Petrarch came to visit the great Mistress of the Sea, taking refuge there, ?in this city, true home of the human race,? from trouble, war and pestilence outside; and Byron, with his facile enthusiasms and fervent eloquence, made his home for a time in one of the stately, decaying palaces; but with these exceptions no great poet has ever associated himself with the life of Venice.  She had architects, sculptors and painters, but no singer of her own.  To realize the popularity of the great poets one should turn to the minor poets and see whom they follow, what master they select, whose music they echo.  Ordinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead, and words and phrases that once touched the heart of the world have become wearisome and meaningless through repetition.  If Theology desires to move us, she must re-write her formulas.  It takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern.  Nature is always a little behind the age.  Mr. Nash, who styles himself ?a humble soldier in the army of Faith,? expresses a hope that his book may ?invigorate devotional feeling, especially among the young, to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than to their elders,? but we should be sorry to think that people of any age could admire such a paraphrase as the following:  It is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the best intentions, and that people are never so trivial as when they take themselves very seriously.  Mr. Foster is an American poet who has read Hawthorne, which is wise of him, and imitated Longfellow, which is not quite so commendable.  _Andiatoroct?_ is the title of a volume of poems by the Rev. Clarence Walworth, of Albany, N.Y.  It is a word borrowed from the Indians, and should, we think, be returned to them as soon as possible.  The most curious poem of the book is called _Scenes at the Holy Home_:  Poems of this kind were popular in the Middle Ages when the cathedrals of every Christian country served as its theatres.  They are anachronisms now, and it is odd that they should come to us from the United States. In matters of this kind we should have some protection.  As for the triolets, and the rondels, and the careful study of metrical subtleties, these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art.  They have had certainly one good result?they have made our minor poets readable, and have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses.  Poetry has many modes of music; she does not blow through one pipe alone. Directness of utterance is good, but so is the subtle recasting of thought into a new and delightful form.  Simplicity is good, but complexity, mystery, strangeness, symbolism, obscurity even, these have their value.  Indeed, properly speaking, there is no such thing as Style; there are merely styles, that is all.  Writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets.  Poetry may be said to need far more self-restraint than prose.  Its conditions are more exquisite.  It produces its effects by more subtle means.  It must not be allowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere eloquence.  It is, in one sense, the most self-conscious of all the arts, as it is never a means to an end but always an end in itself.  It may be difficult for a poet to find English synonyms for Asiatic expressions, but even if it were impossible it is none the less a poet's duty to find them.  As it is, Sir Edwin Arnold has translated Sa?di and some one must translate Sir Edwin Arnold.  Lounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets, but it largely depends on the lounger.  People are so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves, that charity is largely on the increase.  But with this kind of charity I have not much sympathy.  If one gives away a book, it should be a charming book'so charming, that one regrets having given it.  Mr. Whistler, for some reason or other, always adopted the phraseology of the minor prophets.  Possibly it was in order to emphasize his well-known claims to verbal inspiration, or perhaps he thought with Voltaire that _Habakkuk ?tait capable de tout_, and wished to shelter himself under the shield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose prophecies, according to the French philosopher, has ever been fulfilled.  The idea was clever enough at the beginning, but ultimately the manner became monotonous.  The spirit of the Hebrews is excellent but their mode of writing is not to be imitated, and no amount of American jokes will give it that modernity which is essential to a good literary style.  Admirable as are Mr. Whistler's fireworks on canvas, his fireworks in prose are abrupt, violent and exaggerated.  ?The decisive events of the world,? as has been well said, ?take place in the intellect,? and as for Board-schools, academic ceremonies, hospital wards and the like, they may be well left to the artists of the illustrated papers, who do them admirably and quite as well as they need be done.  Indeed, the pictures of contemporary events, Royal marriages, naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in the Academy every year, are always extremely bad; while the very same subjects treated in black and white in the _Graphic_ or the _London News_ are excellent. Besides, if we want to understand the history of a nation through the medium of art, it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go and not to the arts that are definitely imitative.  The visible aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of life's spirit.  The difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour seems to me to be this: if they do not go into society, their books are unreadable; and if they do go into society, they have no time left for writing.  I must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be simply a method of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no one can understand.  Allegory, parable, and vision have their high artistic uses, but their philosophical and scientific uses are very small.  The object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to the artistic instinct, but rather to portray life vividly for us, to draw attention to social anomalies, and social forms of injustice.  Many of our novelists are really pamphleteers, reformers masquerading as story-tellers, earnest sociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life.  The book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so literary as ours, an age in which all social reforms have been preceded and have been largely influenced by fiction.  Mr. Stopford Brooke said some time ago that Socialism and the socialistic spirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song, would widen their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision, and would touch, with the fire and fervour of a new faith, lips that had else been silent, hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold.  What Art gains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a problem that is not easy to solve.  It is, however, certain that Socialism starts well equipped.  She has her poets and her painters, her art lecturers and her cunning designers, her powerful orators and her clever writers.  If she fails it will not be for lack of expression.  If she succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force.  Socialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by any hard and fast creed or to be stereotyped into an iron formula.  She welcomes many and multiform natures.  She rejects none and has room for all.  She has the attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the heart of one and the brain of another, and draws this man by his hatred and injustice, and his neighbour by his faith in the future, and a third, it may be, by his love of art or by his wild worship of a lost and buried past.  And all of this is well.  For, to make men Socialists is nothing, but to make Socialism human is a great thing.  The Reformation gained much from the use of popular hymn-tunes, and the Socialists seem determined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon the people.  However, they must not be too sanguine about the result. The walls of Thebes rose up to the sound of music, and Thebes was a very dull city indeed.  We really must protest against Mr. Matthews? efforts to confuse the poetry of Piccadilly with the poetry of Parnassus.  To tell us, for instance, that Mr. Austin Dobson's verse ?has not the condensed clearness nor the incisive vigor of Mr. Locker's? is really too bad even for Transatlantic criticism.  Nobody who lays claim to the slightest knowledge of literature and the forms of literature should ever bring the two names into conjunction.  Mr. Dobson has produced work that is absolutely classical in its exquisite beauty of form.  Nothing more artistically perfect in its way than the _Lines to a Greek Girl_ has been written in our time.  This little poem will be remembered in literature as long as _Thyrsis_ is remembered, and _Thyrsis_ will never be forgotten.  Both have that note of distinction that is so rare in these days of violence, exaggeration and rhetoric.  Of course, to suggest, as Mr. Matthews does, that Mr. Dobson's poems belong to ?the literature of power? is ridiculous.  Power is not their aim, nor is it their effect.  They have other qualities, and in their own delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals; they have none even second to them.  The heroine is a sort of well-worn Becky Sharp, only much more beautiful than Becky, or at least than Thackeray's portraits of her, which, however, have always seemed to me rather ill-natured.  I feel sure that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was extremely pretty, and I have never understood how it was that Thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a creation of his pen.  A critic recently remarked of Adam Lindsay Gordon that through him Australia had found her first fine utterance in song.  This, however, is an amiable error.  There is very little of Australia in Gordon's poetry. His heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupied with memories and dreams of England and such culture as England gave him.  He owed nothing to the land of his adoption.  Had he stayed at home he would have done much better work.  That Australia, however, will some day make amends by producing a poet of her own we cannot doubt, and for him there will be new notes to sound and new wonders to tell of.  The best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly in Australia those poems that in England he might have made perfect.  Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments.  There seems to be some curious connection between piety and poor rhymes.  The South African poets, as a class, are rather behind the age.  They seem to think that ?Aurora? is a very novel and delightful epithet for the dawn.  On the whole they depress us.  The only original thing in the volume is the description of Mr. Robert Buchanan's ?grandeur of mind.?  This is decidedly new.  Dr. Cockle tells us that M?llner's _Guilt_ and _The Ancestress_ of Grillparzer are the masterpieces of German fate-tragedy.  His translation of the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for any further acquaintance with the school.  Here is a specimen from the fourth act of the fate-tragedy.  The Renaissance had for its object the development of great personalities.  The perfect freedom of the temperament in matters of art, the perfect freedom of the intellect in intellectual matters, the full development of the individual, were the things it aimed at.  As we study its history we find it full of great anarchies.  It solved no political or social problems; it did not seek to solve them.  The ideal of the ?Grand Si?cle,? and of Richelieu, in whom the forces of that great age were incarnate, was different.  The ideas of citizenship, of the building up of a great nation, of the centralization of forces, of collective action, of ethnic unity of purpose, came before the world.  The creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is never without its danger, and it is sad to find the provincial towns of France, once so varied and individual in artistic expression, writing to Paris for designs and advice.  And yet, through Colbert's great centralizing scheme of State supervision and State aid, France was the one country in Europe, and has remained the one country in Europe, where the arts are not divorced from industry.  Hawthorne re-created for us the America of the past with the incomparable grace of a very perfect artist, but Mr. Bret Harte's emphasized modernity has, in its own sphere, won equal, or almost equal, triumphs.  It is pleasant to come across a heroine [Bret Harte's _Cressy_] who is not identified with any great cause, and represents no important principle, but is simply a wonderful nymph from American backwoods, who has in her something of Artemis, and not a little of Aphrodite.  It is always a pleasure to come across an American poet who is not national, and who tries to give expression to the literature that he loves rather than to the land in which he lives.  The Muses care so little for geography!  Blue-books are generally dull reading, but Blue-books on Ireland have always been interesting.  They form the record of one of the great tragedies of modern Europe.  In them England has written down her indictment against herself and has given to the world the history of her shame.  If in the last century she tried to govern Ireland with an insolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice, she has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that is aggravated by good intentions.  Like most penmen he [Froude] overrates the power of the sword.  Where England has had to struggle she has been wise.  Where physical strength has been on her side, as in Ireland, she has been made unwieldy by that strength.  Her own strong hands have blinded her.  She has had force but no direction.  There are some who will welcome with delight the idea of solving the Irish question by doing away with the Irish people.  There are others who will remember that Ireland has extended her boundaries, and that we have now to reckon with her not merely in the Old World but in the New.  Plastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible aspect of life; it is different when we come to deal with those secrets which self-consciousness alone contains, and which self-consciousness itself can but half reveal.  Action takes place in the sunlight, but the soul works in the dark.  There is something curiously interesting in the marked tendency of modern poetry to become obscure.  Many critics, writing with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature, have ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to affectation.  Its origin is rather to be found in the complexity of the new problems, and in the fact that self-consciousness is not yet adequate to explain the contents of the Ego.  In Mr. Browning's poems, as in life itself, which has suggested, or rather necessitated, the new method, thought seems to proceed not on logical lines, but on lines of passion.  The unity of the individual is being expressed through its inconsistencies and its contradictions.  In a strange twilight man is seeking for himself, and when he has found his own image, he cannot understand it.  Objective forms of art, such as sculpture and the drama, sufficed one for the perfect presentation of life; they can no longer so suffice.  As he is not a genius he, naturally, behaves admirably on every occasion.  Certainly dialect is dramatic.  It is a vivid method of re-creating a past that never existed.  It is something between ?A Return to Nature? and ?A Return to the Glossary.?  It is so artificial that it is really na?ve.  From the point of view of mere music, much may be said for it. Wonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song.  There are possibilities of fresh rhymes, and in search for a fresh rhyme poets may be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classical utterance into devious byways and less-trodden paths.  Sometimes one is tempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of provincialisms, but there is more in it than mere mispronunciation.  With that revival of an antique form, often comes the revival of an antique spirit.  Through limitations that are sometimes uncouth, and always narrow, comes Tragedy herself; and though she may stammer in her utterance, and deck herself in cast-off weeds and trammelling raiment, still we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her, so rare are her visits to us now, so rare her presence in an age that demands a happy ending from every play, and that sees in the theatre merely a source of amusement.  There is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards. The last page is, as a rule, the most interesting, and when one begins with the catastrophe or the _d?no?ment_ one feels on pleasant terms of equality with the author.  It is like going behind the scenes of a theatre.  One is no longer taken in, and the hairbreadth escapes of the hero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved.  He has every form of sincerity except the sincerity of the artist, a defect that he shares with most of our popular writers.  On the whole _Primavera_ is a pleasant little book, and we are glad to welcome it.  It is charmingly ?got up,? and undergraduates might read it with advantage during lecture hours.     The artist is the creator of beautiful things.  To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.  The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.  The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.  This is a fault.  Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.  For these there is hope.  They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.  There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.  Books are well written, or badly written.  That is all.  The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.  The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.  The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.  No artist desires to prove anything.  Even things that are true can be proved.  No artist has ethical sympathies.  An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.  No artist is ever morbid.  The artist can express everything.  Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.  Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.  From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.  From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type.  All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.  Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.  It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.  Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.  When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.  We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.  The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.                 All art is quite useless.  The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.  From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.  The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.  The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.  In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordi|2
15|"nary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.  As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there.  But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.  ""It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"" said Lord Henry languidly.  ""You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.  The Academy is too large and too vulgar.  Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.  The Grosvenor is really the only place.""  ""I don't think I shall send it anywhere,"" he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford.  ""No, I won't send it anywhere.""  Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.  ""Not send it anywhere?  My dear fellow, why?  Have you any reason?  What odd chaps you painters are!  You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.  As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.  It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.  A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.""  ""I know you will laugh at me,"" he replied, ""but I really can't exhibit it.  I have put too much of myself into it.""  Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.  ""Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.""  ""Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that.  But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.  Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.  The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid.  Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are!  Except, of course, in the Church.  But then in the Church they don't think.  A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.  I feel quite sure of that.  He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.  Don't flatter yourself, Basil:  you are not in the least like him.""  ""You don't understand me, Harry,"" answered the artist.  ""Of course I am not like him.  I know that perfectly well.  Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him.  You shrug your shoulders?  I am telling you the truth.  There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.  It is better not to be different from one's fellows.  The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.  If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.  They live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.  They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.  Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.""  ""Dorian Gray?  Is that his name?"" asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.  ""Yes, that is his name.  I didn't intend to tell it to you.""  ""But why not?""  ""Oh, I can't explain.  When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one.  It is like surrendering a part of them.  I have grown to love secrecy.  It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us.  The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.  When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going.  If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.  It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life.  I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?""  ""Not at all,"" answered Lord Henry, ""not at all, my dear Basil.  You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.  I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.  My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact, than I am.  She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all.  I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me.""  ""I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.  ""I believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.  You are an extraordinary fellow.  You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose.""  ""Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.  The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves.  In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.  After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.  ""I am afraid I must be going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago.""  ""What is that?"" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.  ""You know quite well.""  ""I do not, Harry.""  ""Well, I will tell you what it is.  I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.  I want the real reason.""  ""I told you the real reason.""  ""No, you did not.  You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it.  Now, that is childish.""  ""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.  The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.  It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.  The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.""  Lord Henry laughed.  ""And what is that?"" he asked.  ""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his face.  ""I am all expectation, Basil,"" continued his companion, glancing at him.  ""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the painter; ""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.  Perhaps you will hardly believe it.""  Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it.  ""I am quite sure I shall understand it,"" he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, ""and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.""  The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air.  A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings.  Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and wondered what was coming.  ""The story is simply this,"" said the painter after some time.  ""Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.  With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.  Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me.  I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale.  A curious sensation of terror came over me.  I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.  I did not want any external influence in my life.  You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.  I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you.  Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.  I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.  I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.  It was not conscience that made me do so:  it was a sort of cowardice.  I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.""  ""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm.  That is all.""  ""I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either. However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door.  There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon.  'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out.  You know her curiously shrill voice?""  ""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.  ""I could not get rid of her.  She brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses.  She spoke of me as her dearest friend.  I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.  I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.  Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me.  We were quite close, almost touching.  Our eyes met again. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all.  It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.  I am sure of that.  Dorian told me so afterwards.  He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other.""  ""And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"" asked his companion.  ""I know she goes in for giving a rapid _precis_ of all her guests.  I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding details.  I simply fled.  I like to find out people for myself.  But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.  She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know.""  ""Poor Lady Brandon!  You are hard on her, Harry!"" said Hallward listlessly.  ""My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in opening a restaurant.  How could I admire her?  But tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?""  ""Oh, something like, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable.  Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?'  Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.""  ""Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,"" said the young lord, plucking another daisy.  Hallward shook his head.  ""You don't understand what friendship is, Harry,"" he murmured--""or what enmity is, for that matter.  You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.""  ""How horribly unjust of you!"" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky.  ""Yes; horribly unjust of you.  I make a great difference between people.  I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.  A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool.  They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me.  Is that very vain of me?  I think it is rather vain.""  ""I should think it was, Harry.  But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.""  ""My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.""  ""And much less than a friend.  A sort of brother, I suppose?""  ""Oh, brothers!  I don't care for brothers.  My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.""  ""Harry!"" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.  ""My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.  But I can't help detesting my relations.  I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.  I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders.  The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves.  When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent.  And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly.""  ""I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either.""  Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane.  ""How English you are Basil!  That is the second time you have made that observation.  If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to do--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself.  Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.  Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.  However, I don't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.  I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.  Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.  How often do you see him?""  ""Every day.  I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.  He is absolutely necessary to me.""  ""How extraordinary!  I thought you would never care for anything but your art.""  ""He is all my art to me now,"" said the painter gravely.  ""I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history.  The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me.  It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him.  Of course, I have done all that.  But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.  I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it.  There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.  But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.  I see things differently, I think of them differently.  I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before.  'A dream of form in days of thought'--who is it who says that?  I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.  The merely visible presence of this lad--for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty--his merely visible presence--ah!  I wonder can you realize all that that means?  Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.  The harmony of soul and body--how much that is!  We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.  Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!  You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?  It is one of the best things I have ever done.  And why is it so?  Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.  Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.""  ""Basil, this is extraordinary!  I must see Dorian Gray.""  Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.  After some time he came back.  ""Harry,"" he said, ""Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art.  You might see nothing in him.  I see everything in him.  He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.  He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.  I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours.  That is all.""  ""Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?"" asked Lord Henry.  ""Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to speak to him.  He knows nothing about it.  He shall never know anything about it.  But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes.  My heart shall never be put under their microscope.  There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry--too much of myself!""  ""Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.  They know how useful passion is for publication.  Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.""  ""I hate them for it,"" cried Hallward.  ""An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.  We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.  We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.  Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.""  ""I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you.  It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.  Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?""  The painter considered for a few moments.  ""He likes me,"" he answered after a pause; ""I know he likes me.  Of course I flatter him dreadfully.  I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said.  As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.  Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.  Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.""  ""Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,"" murmured Lord Henry. ""Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.  It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.  That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.  In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.  The thoroughly well-informed man--that is the modern ideal.  And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.  It is like a _bric-a-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.  I think you will tire first, all the same.  Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.  The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent.  It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.  What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.""  ""Harry, don't talk like that.  As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.  You can't feel what I feel.  You change too often.""  ""Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.  Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.""  And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.  There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.  How pleasant it was in the garden!  And how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him.  One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends--those were the fascinating things in life.  He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.  Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.  The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.  It was charming to have escaped all that!  As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him.  He turned to Hallward and said, ""My dear fellow, I have just remembered.""  ""Remembered what, Harry?""  ""Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.""  ""Where was it?"" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.  ""Don't look so angry, Basil.  It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's.  She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.  I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not.  She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature.  I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.  I wish I had known it was your friend.""  ""I am very glad you didn't, Harry.""  ""Why?""  ""I don't want you to meet him.""  ""You don't want me to meet him?""  ""No.""  ""Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,"" said the butler, coming into the garden.  ""You must introduce me now,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing.  The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. ""Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker:  I shall be in in a few moments."" The man bowed and went up the walk.  Then he looked at Lord Henry.  ""Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,"" he said.  ""He has a simple and a beautiful nature.  Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him.  Don't spoil him.  Don't try to influence him.  Your influence would be bad.  The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it.  Don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses:  my life as an artist depends on him.  Mind, Harry, I trust you.""  He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.  ""What nonsense you talk!"" said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.  As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.  He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's ""Forest Scenes.""  ""You must lend me these, Basil,"" he cried.  ""I want to learn them.  They are perfectly charming.""  ""That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.""  ""Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of myself,"" answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner.  When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up.  ""I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you.""  ""This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.  I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything.""  ""You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,"" said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand.  ""My aunt has often spoken to me about you.  You are one of her favourites, and, I am afraid, one of her victims also.""  ""I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present,"" answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence.  ""I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.  We were to have played a duet together--three duets, I believe.  I don't know what she will say to me.  I am far too frightened to call.""  ""Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt.  She is quite devoted to you. And I don't think it really matters about your not being there.  The audience probably thought it was a duet.  When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.""  ""That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,"" answered Dorian, laughing.  Lord Henry looked at him.  Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair.  There was something in his face that made one trust him at once.  All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's passionate purity.  One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world.  No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.  ""You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too charming."" And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.  The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready.  He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry's last remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, ""Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?""  Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.  ""Am I to go, Mr. Gray?"" he asked.  ""Oh, please don't, Lord Henry.  I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods, and I can't bear him when he sulks.  Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.""  ""I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.  It is so tediou"|2
16|"s a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it.  But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.  You don't really mind, Basil, do you?  You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to.""  Hallward bit his lip.  ""If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself.""  Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.  ""You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go.  I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans.  Good-bye, Mr. Gray.  Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street.  I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when you are coming.  I should be sorry to miss you.""  ""Basil,"" cried Dorian Gray, ""if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go, too.  You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.  Ask him to stay.  I insist upon it.""  ""Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,"" said Hallward, gazing intently at his picture.  ""It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters.  I beg you to stay.""  ""But what about my man at the Orleans?""  The painter laughed.  ""I don't think there will be any difficulty about that.  Sit down again, Harry.  And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says.  He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception of myself.""  Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy.  He was so unlike Basil.  They made a delightful contrast.  And he had such a beautiful voice.  After a few moments he said to him, ""Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?  As bad as Basil says?""  ""There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.  All influence is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view.""  ""Why?""  ""Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul.  He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.  His virtues are not real to him.  His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed.  He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.  The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each of us is here for.  People are afraid of themselves, nowadays.  They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self.  Of course, they are charitable.  They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar.  But their own souls starve, and are naked.  Courage has gone out of our race.  Perhaps we never really had it.  The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion--these are the two things that govern us.  And yet--""  ""Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy,"" said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he had never seen there before.  ""And yet,"" continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, ""I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream--I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.  But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.  The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives.  We are punished for our refusals.  Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.  The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.  Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.  Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.  It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain.  It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.  You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--""  ""Stop!"" faltered Dorian Gray, ""stop! you bewilder me.  I don't know what to say.  There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.  Don't speak.  Let me think.  Or, rather, let me try not to think.""  For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes strangely bright.  He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him.  Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself.  The few words that Basil's friend had said to him--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.  Music had stirred him like that.  Music had troubled him many times. But music was not articulate.  It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us.  Words!  Mere words!  How terrible they were!  How clear, and vivid, and cruel!  One could not escape from them.  And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!  They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.  Mere words!  Was there anything so real as words?  Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He understood them now.  Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire.  Why had he not known it?  With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him.  He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing.  He felt intensely interested.  He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air.  Had it hit the mark?  How fascinating the lad was!  Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from strength.  He was unconscious of the silence.  ""Basil, I am tired of standing,"" cried Dorian Gray suddenly.  ""I must go out and sit in the garden.  The air is stifling here.""  ""My dear fellow, I am so sorry.  When I am painting, I can't think of anything else.  But you never sat better.  You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes.  I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose he has been paying you compliments.  You mustn't believe a word that he says.""  ""He has certainly not been paying me compliments.  Perhaps that is the reason that I don't believe anything he has told me.""  ""You know you believe it all,"" said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes.  ""I will go out to the garden with you.  It is horribly hot in the studio.  Basil, let us have something iced to drink, something with strawberries in it.""  ""Certainly, Harry.  Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want.  I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on.  Don't keep Dorian too long.  I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece.  It is my masterpiece as it stands.""  Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine.  He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder.  ""You are quite right to do that,"" he murmured. ""Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.""  The lad started and drew back.  He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened.  His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.  ""Yes,"" continued Lord Henry, ""that is one of the great secrets of life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.  You are a wonderful creation.  You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.""  Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.  He could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him.  His romantic, olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him.  There was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm.  They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.  But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.  Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?  He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him.  Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life's mystery.  And, yet, what was there to be afraid of?  He was not a schoolboy or a girl.  It was absurd to be frightened.  ""Let us go and sit in the shade,"" said Lord Henry.  ""Parker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.  You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt.  It would be unbecoming.""  ""What can it matter?"" cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden.  ""It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.""  ""Why?""  ""Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.""  ""I don't feel that, Lord Henry.""  ""No, you don't feel it now.  Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.  Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.  Don't frown.  You have.  And beauty is a form of genius--is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.  It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.  It cannot be questioned.  It has its divine right of sovereignty.  It makes princes of those who have it.  You smile?  Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial.  That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.  To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders.  It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.  The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.  But what the gods give they quickly take away.  You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully.  When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.  Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful.  Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.  You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.  You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.  Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age.  Live!  Live the wonderful life that is in you!  Let nothing be lost upon you.  Be always searching for new sensations.  Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants.  You might be its visible symbol.  With your personality there is nothing you could not do.  The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.  There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself.  I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.  For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time.  The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.  The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.  But we never get back our youth.  The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish.  Our limbs fail, our senses rot.  We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.  Youth!  Youth!  There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!""  Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.  The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel.  A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment.  Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms.  He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.  After a time the bee flew away.  He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus.  The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.  Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in.  They turned to each other and smiled.  ""I am waiting,"" he cried.  ""Do come in.  The light is quite perfect, and you can bring your drinks.""  They rose up and sauntered down the walk together.  Two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.  ""You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,"" said Lord Henry, looking at him.  ""Yes, I am glad now.  I wonder shall I always be glad?""  ""Always!  That is a dreadful word.  It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it.  They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever.  It is a meaningless word, too.  The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.""  As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry's arm.  ""In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,"" he murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose.  Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him. The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance.  In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden.  The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.  After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning.  ""It is quite finished,"" he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.  Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.  It was certainly a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.  ""My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,"" he said.  ""It is the finest portrait of modern times.  Mr. Gray, come over and look at yourself.""  The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.  ""Is it really finished?"" he murmured, stepping down from the platform.  ""Quite finished,"" said the painter.  ""And you have sat splendidly to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.""  ""That is entirely due to me,"" broke in Lord Henry.  ""Isn't it, Mr. Gray?""  Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it.  When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure.  A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.  He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.  The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation.  He had never felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship.  He had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them.  They had not influenced his nature.  Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity.  That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him.  Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed.  The scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair.  The life that was to make his soul would mar his body.  He would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.  As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.  His eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears.  He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.  ""Don't you like it?"" cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.  ""Of course he likes it,"" said Lord Henry.  ""Who wouldn't like it?  It is one of the greatest things in modern art.  I will give you anything you like to ask for it.  I must have it.""  ""It is not my property, Harry.""  ""Whose property is it?""  ""Dorian's, of course,"" answered the painter.  ""He is a very lucky fellow.""  ""How sad it is!"" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait.  ""How sad it is!  I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful.  But this picture will remain always young.  It will never be older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other way!  If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!  For that--for that--I would give everything!  Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!  I would give my soul for that!""  ""You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing.  ""It would be rather hard lines on your work.""  ""I should object very strongly, Harry,"" said Hallward.  Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.  ""I believe you would, Basil. You like your art better than your friends.  I am no more to you than a green bronze figure.  Hardly as much, I dare say.""  The painter stared in amazement.  It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that.  What had happened?  He seemed quite angry.  His face was flushed and his cheeks burning.  ""Yes,"" he continued, ""I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun.  You will like them always.  How long will you like me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose.  I know, now, that when one loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that.  Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth is the only thing worth having.  When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself.""  Hallward turned pale and caught his hand.  ""Dorian!  Dorian!"" he cried, ""don't talk like that.  I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another.  You are not jealous of material things, are you?--you who are finer than any of them!""  ""I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.  I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me.  Why should it keep what I must lose?  Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it.  Oh, if it were only the other way!  If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!  Why did you paint it?  It will mock me some day--mock me horribly!""  The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.  ""This is your doing, Harry,"" said the painter bitterly.  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  ""It is the real Dorian Gray--that is all.""  ""It is not.""  ""If it is not, what have I to do with it?""  ""You should have gone away when I asked you,"" he muttered.  ""I stayed when you asked me,"" was Lord Henry's answer.  ""Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it.  What is it but canvas and colour?  I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them.""  Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window.  What was he doing there?  His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.  Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.  He had found it at last.  He was going to rip up the canvas.  With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.  ""Don't, Basil, don't!"" he cried.  ""It would be murder!""  ""I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,"" said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise.  ""I never thought you would.""  ""Appreciate it?  I am in love with it, Basil.  It is part of myself.  I feel that.""  ""Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home.  Then you can do what you like with yourself."" And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea.  ""You will have tea, of course, Dorian?  And so will you, Harry?  Or do you object to such simple pleasures?""  ""I adore simple pleasures,"" said Lord Henry.  ""They are the last refuge of the complex.  But I don't like scenes, except on the stage.  What absurd fellows you are, both of you!  I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal.  It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational.  I am glad he is not, after all--though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture.  You had much better let me have it, Basil.  This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I really do.""  ""If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!"" cried Dorian Gray; ""and I don't allow people to call me a silly boy.""  ""You know the picture is yours, Dorian.  I gave it to you before it existed.""  ""And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.""  ""I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.""  ""Ah! this morning!  You have lived since then.""  There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.  There was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.  Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea.  The two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers.  ""Let us go to the theatre to-night,"" said Lord Henry.  ""There is sure to be something on, somewhere.  I have promised to dine at White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement.  I think that would be a rather nice excuse:  it would have all the surprise of candour.""  ""It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes,"" muttered Hallward. ""And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.""  ""Yes,"" answered Lord Henry dreamily, ""the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable.  It is so sombre, so depressing.  Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life.""  ""You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.""  ""Before which Dorian?  The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one in the picture?""  ""Before either.""  ""I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,"" said the lad.  ""Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won't you?""  ""I can't, really.  I would sooner not.  I have a lot of work to do.""  ""Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.""  ""I should like that awfully.""  The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. ""I shall stay with the real Dorian,"" he said, sadly.  ""Is it the real Dorian?"" cried the original of the portrait, strolling across to him.  ""Am I really like that?""  ""Yes; you are just like that.""  ""How wonderful, Basil!""  ""At least you are like it in appearance.  But it will never alter,"" sighed Hallward.  ""That is something.""  ""What a fuss people make about fidelity!"" exclaimed Lord Henry.  ""Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology.  It has nothing to do with our own will.  Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.""  ""Don't go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,"" said Hallward.  ""Stop and dine with me.""  ""I can't, Basil.""  ""Why?""  ""Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.""  ""He won't like you the better for keeping your promises.  He always breaks his own.  I beg you not to go.""  Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.  ""I entreat you.""  The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.  ""I must go, Basil,"" he answered.  ""Very well,"" said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray.  ""It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better lose no time.  Good-bye, Harry.  Good-bye, Dorian.  Come and see me soon.  Come to-morrow.""  ""Certainly.""  ""You won't forget?""  ""No, of course not,"" cried Dorian.  ""And ... Harry!""  ""Yes, Basil?""  ""Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.""  ""I have forgotten it.""  ""I trust you.""  ""I wish I could trust myself,"" said Lord Henry, laughing.  ""Come, Mr. Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place. Good-bye, Basil.  It has been a most interesting afternoon.""  As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.      At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure.  The son, who had been his father's secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious "|2
17|"study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.  He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club.  He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth.  In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals.  He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.  His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.  When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_.  ""Well, Harry,"" said the old gentleman, ""what brings you out so early?  I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five.""  ""Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George.  I want to get something out of you.""  ""Money, I suppose,"" said Lord Fermor, making a wry face.  ""Well, sit down and tell me all about it.  Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.""  ""Yes,"" murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; ""and when they grow older they know it.  But I don't want money.  It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.  Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it.  Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me.  What I want is information:  not useful information, of course; useless information.""  ""Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.  When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better.  But I hear they let them in now by examination.  What can you expect?  Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.""  ""Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,"" said Lord Henry languidly.  ""Mr. Dorian Gray?  Who is he?"" asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white eyebrows.  ""That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George.  Or rather, I know who he is.  He is the last Lord Kelso's grandson.  His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.  I want you to tell me about his mother.  What was she like?  Whom did she marry?  You have known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her.  I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present.  I have only just met him.""  ""Kelso's grandson!"" echoed the old gentleman.  ""Kelso's grandson! ... Of course.... I knew his mother intimately.  I believe I was at her christening.  She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind.  Certainly.  I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday.  The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage.  There was an ugly story about it.  They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public--paid him, sir, to do it, paid him--and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon.  The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards.  He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again.  Oh, yes; it was a bad business.  The girl died, too, died within a year.  So she left a son, did she?  I had forgotten that.  What sort of boy is he?  If he is like his mother, he must be a good-looking chap.""  ""He is very good-looking,"" assented Lord Henry.  ""I hope he will fall into proper hands,"" continued the old man.  ""He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him.  His mother had money, too.  All the Selby property came to her, through her grandfather.  Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog.  He was, too.  Came to Madrid once when I was there.  Egad, I was ashamed of him.  The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares.  They made quite a story of it.  I didn't dare show my face at Court for a month.  I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.""  ""I don't know,"" answered Lord Henry.  ""I fancy that the boy will be well off.  He is not of age yet.  He has Selby, I know.  He told me so. And ... his mother was very beautiful?""  ""Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry.  What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand.  She could have married anybody she chose.  Carlington was mad after her.  She was romantic, though.  All the women of that family were.  The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her.  Told me so himself.  She laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after him.  And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?  Ain't English girls good enough for him?""  ""It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.""  ""I'll back English women against the world, Harry,"" said Lord Fermor, striking the table with his fist.  ""The betting is on the Americans.""  ""They don't last, I am told,"" muttered his uncle.  ""A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase.  They take things flying.  I don't think Dartmoor has a chance.""  ""Who are her people?"" grumbled the old gentleman.  ""Has she got any?""  Lord Henry shook his head.  ""American girls are as clever at concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,"" he said, rising to go.  ""They are pork-packers, I suppose?""  ""I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake.  I am told that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after politics.""  ""Is she pretty?""  ""She behaves as if she was beautiful.  Most American women do.  It is the secret of their charm.""  ""Why can't these American women stay in their own country?  They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women.""  ""It is.  That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of it,"" said Lord Henry.  ""Good-bye, Uncle George. I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.  Thanks for giving me the information I wanted.  I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.""  ""Where are you lunching, Harry?""  ""At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray.  He is her latest _protege_.""  ""Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her charity appeals.  I am sick of them.  Why, the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.""  ""All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her, but it won't have any effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.  It is their distinguishing characteristic.""  The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant.  Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.  So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage.  Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance.  A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion.  A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime.  Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain.  The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.  Yes; it was an interesting background.  It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were.  Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.  Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.  Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin.  He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.  No other activity was like it.  To project one's soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.  Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us.  There was nothing that one could not do with him.  He could be made a Titan or a toy.  What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ...  And Basil?  From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was!  The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real:  how strange it all was!  He remembered something like it in history.  Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it?  Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait.  He would seek to dominate him--had already, indeed, half done so.  He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.  Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses.  He found that he had passed his aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back. When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch.  He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.  ""Late as usual, Harry,"" cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.  He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to her, looked round to see who was there.  Dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek. Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness.  Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule.  The post on her left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was thirty.  His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book. Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever quite escape.  ""We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,"" cried the duchess, nodding pleasantly to him across the table.  ""Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person?""  ""I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.""  ""How dreadful!"" exclaimed Lady Agatha.  ""Really, some one should interfere.""  ""I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American dry-goods store,"" said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.  ""My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.""  ""Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?"" asked the duchess, raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.  ""American novels,"" answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.  The duchess looked puzzled.  ""Don't mind him, my dear,"" whispered Lady Agatha.  ""He never means anything that he says.""  ""When America was discovered,"" said the Radical member--and he began to give some wearisome facts.  Like all people who try to exhaust a subject, he exhausted his listeners.  The duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption.  ""I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all!"" she exclaimed.  ""Really, our girls have no chance nowadays.  It is most unfair.""  ""Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,"" said Mr. Erskine; ""I myself would say that it had merely been detected.""  ""Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,"" answered the duchess vaguely.  ""I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty.  And they dress well, too.  They get all their dresses in Paris.  I wish I could afford to do the same.""  ""They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,"" chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.  ""Really!  And where do bad Americans go to when they die?"" inquired the duchess.  ""They go to America,"" murmured Lord Henry.  Sir Thomas frowned.  ""I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country,"" he said to Lady Agatha.  ""I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil.  I assure you that it is an education to visit it.""  ""But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?"" asked Mr. Erskine plaintively.  ""I don't feel up to the journey.""  Sir Thomas waved his hand.  ""Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.""  ""How dreadful!"" cried Lord Henry.  ""I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable.  There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect.""  ""I do not understand you,"" said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.  ""I do, Lord Henry,"" murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.  ""Paradoxes are all very well in their way...."" rejoined the baronet.  ""Was that a paradox?"" asked Mr. Erskine.  ""I did not think so.  Perhaps it was.  Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth.  To test reality we must see it on the tight rope.  When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.""  ""Dear me!"" said Lady Agatha, ""how you men argue!  I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about.  Oh!  Harry, I am quite vexed with you.  Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End?  I assure you he would be quite invaluable.  They would love his playing.""  ""I want him to play to me,"" cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.  ""But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,"" continued Lady Agatha.  ""I can sympathize with everything except suffering,"" said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders.  ""I cannot sympathize with that.  It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.  There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain.  One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.  The less said about life's sores, the better.""  ""Still, the East End is a very important problem,"" remarked Sir Thomas with a grave shake of the head.  ""Quite so,"" answered the young lord.  ""It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.""  The politician looked at him keenly.  ""What change do you propose, then?"" he asked.  Lord Henry laughed.  ""I don't desire to change anything in England except the weather,"" he answered.  ""I am quite content with philosophic contemplation.  But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.  The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.""  ""But we have such grave responsibilities,"" ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly.  ""Terribly grave,"" echoed Lady Agatha.  Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine.  ""Humanity takes itself too seriously.  It is the world's original sin.  If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different.""  ""You are really very comforting,"" warbled the duchess.  ""I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.  For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush.""  ""A blush is very becoming, Duchess,"" remarked Lord Henry.  ""Only when one is young,"" she answered.  ""When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign.  Ah!  Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.""  He thought for a moment.  ""Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?"" he asked, looking at her across the table.  ""A great many, I fear,"" she cried.  ""Then commit them over again,"" he said gravely.  ""To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.""  ""A delightful theory!"" she exclaimed.  ""I must put it into practice.""  ""A dangerous theory!"" came from Sir Thomas's tight lips.  Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused.  Mr. Erskine listened.  ""Yes,"" he continued, ""that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.""  A laugh ran round the table.  He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox.  The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober.  Facts fled before her like frightened forest things.  Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides.  It was an extraordinary improvisation.  He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination.  He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible.  He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing.  Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.  At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting.  She wrung her hands in mock despair.  ""How annoying!"" she cried.  ""I must go.  I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.  If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet.  It is far too fragile.  A harsh word would ruin it.  No, I must go, dear Agatha.  Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing.  I am sure I don't know what to say about your views.  You must come and dine with us some night.  Tuesday?  Are you disengaged Tuesday?""  ""For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,"" said Lord Henry with a bow.  ""Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,"" she cried; ""so mind you come""; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies.  When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.  ""You talk books away,"" he said; ""why don't you write one?""  ""I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.  I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal.  But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature.""  ""I fear you are right,"" answered Mr. Erskine.  ""I myself used to have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.  And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?""  ""I quite forget what I said,"" smiled Lord Henry.  ""Was it all very bad?""  ""Very bad indeed.  In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.  But I should like to talk to you about life. The generation into which I was born was tedious.  Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess.""  ""I shall be charmed.  A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It has a perfect host, and a perfect library.""  ""You will complete it,"" answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow.  ""And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.  I am due at the Athenaeum.  It is the hour when we sleep there.""  ""All of you, Mr. Erskine?""  ""Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English Academy of Letters.""  Lord Henry laughed and rose.  ""I am going to the park,"" he cried.  As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm. ""Let me come with you,"" he murmured.  ""But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,"" answered Lord Henry.  ""I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.  Do let me.  And you will promise to talk to me all the time?  No one talks so wonderfully as you do.""  ""Ah!  I have talked quite enough for to-day,"" said Lord Henry, smiling. ""All I want now is to look at life.  You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.""      One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.  It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk, long-fringed Persian rugs.  On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device.  Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.  Lord Henry had not yet come in.  He was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.  So the lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him.  Once or twice he thought of going away.  At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened.  ""How late you are, Harry!"" he murmured.  ""I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,"" answered a shrill voice.  He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet.  ""I beg your pardon.  I thought--""  ""You thought it was my husband.  It is only his wife.  You must let me introduce myself.  I know you quite well by your photographs.  I think my husband has got seventeen of them.""  ""Not seventeen, Lady Henry?""  ""Well, eighteen, then.  And I saw you with him the other night at the opera.""  She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her vague forget-me-not eyes.  She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.  She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.  She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.  Her name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.  ""That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?""  ""Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin.  I like Wagner's music better than anybody's. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says.  That is a great advantage, don't you think so, Mr. Gray?""  The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.  Dorian smiled and shook his head:  ""I am afraid I don't think so, Lady Henry.  I never talk during music--at least, during good music.  If one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation.""  ""Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?  I always hear Harry's views from his friends.  It is the only way I get to know of them.  But you must not think I don't like good music.  I adore it, but I am afraid of it.  It makes me too romantic.  I have simply worshipped pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me.  I don't know what it is about them.  Perhaps it is that they are foreigners.  They all are, ain't they?  Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time, don't they?  It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art.  Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it?  You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?  You must come.  I can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners.  They make one's rooms look so picturesque.  But here is Harry!  Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something--I forget what it was--and I found Mr. Gray here.  We have had such a pleasant chat about music.  We have quite the same ideas.  No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant.  I am so glad I've seen him.""  ""I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,"" said Lord Henry, elevating his dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile.  ""So sorry I am late, Dorian.  I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.""  ""I am afraid I must be going,"" exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh.  ""I have promised to drive with the duchess.  Good-bye, Mr. Gray.  Good-bye, Harry.  You are dining out, I suppose?  So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury's.""  ""I dare s"|2
18|"ay, my dear,"" said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni.  Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa.  ""Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,"" he said after a few puffs.  ""Why, Harry?""  ""Because they are so sentimental.""  ""But I like sentimental people.""  ""Never marry at all, Dorian.  Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious:  both are disappointed.""  ""I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry.  I am too much in love. That is one of your aphorisms.  I am putting it into practice, as I do everything that you say.""  ""Who are you in love with?"" asked Lord Henry after a pause.  ""With an actress,"" said Dorian Gray, blushing.  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  ""That is a rather commonplace _debut_.""  ""You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.""  ""Who is she?""  ""Her name is Sibyl Vane.""  ""Never heard of her.""  ""No one has.  People will some day, however.  She is a genius.""  ""My dear boy, no woman is a genius.  Women are a decorative sex.  They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.  Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.""  ""Harry, how can you?""  ""My dear Dorian, it is quite true.  I am analysing women at present, so I ought to know.  The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured.  The plain women are very useful.  If you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to supper.  The other women are very charming.  They commit one mistake, however.  They paint in order to try and look young.  Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.  _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used to go together.  That is all over now.  As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied.  As for conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decent society.  However, tell me about your genius.  How long have you known her?""  ""Ah!  Harry, your views terrify me.""  ""Never mind that.  How long have you known her?""  ""About three weeks.""  ""And where did you come across her?""  ""I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it. After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.  You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.  For days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.  As I lounged in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they led.  Some of them fascinated me.  Others filled me with terror.  There was an exquisite poison in the air.  I had a passion for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined to go out in search of some adventure.  I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.  I fancied a thousand things.  The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.  I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret of life.  I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares.  About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.  A hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.  He had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. 'Have a box, my Lord?' he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility.  There was something about him, Harry, that amused me.  He was such a monster.  You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn't--my dear Harry, if I hadn't--I should have missed the greatest romance of my life.  I see you are laughing.  It is horrid of you!""  ""I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.  But you should not say the greatest romance of your life.  You should say the first romance of your life.  You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love.  A _grande passion_ is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one use of the idle classes of a country.  Don't be afraid.  There are exquisite things in store for you.  This is merely the beginning.""  ""Do you think my nature so shallow?"" cried Dorian Gray angrily.  ""No; I think your nature so deep.""  ""How do you mean?""  ""My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people.  What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect--simply a confession of failure.  Faithfulness!  I must analyse it some day.  The passion for property is in it.  There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.  But I don't want to interrupt you.  Go on with your story.""  ""Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.  I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house.  It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress-circle.  Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.""  ""It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.""  ""Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing.  I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill.  What do you think the play was, Harry?""  ""I should think 'The Idiot Boy', or 'Dumb but Innocent'.  Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe.  The longer I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us.  In art, as in politics, _les grandperes ont toujours tort_.""  ""This play was good enough for us, Harry.  It was Romeo and Juliet.  I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place.  Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way.  At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began.  Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad.  He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit.  They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet!  Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.  She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.  You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.  I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me.  And her voice--I never heard such a voice.  It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's ear.  Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy.  In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.  There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.  You know how a voice can stir one.  Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget.  When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different.  I don't know which to follow.  Why should I not love her?  Harry, I do love her.  She is everything to me in life.  Night after night I go to see her play.  One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.  I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover's lips.  I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of.  She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat.  I have seen her in every age and in every costume.  Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination.  They are limited to their century.  No glamour ever transfigures them.  One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.  One can always find them.  There is no mystery in any of them.  They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.  They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner.  They are quite obvious.  But an actress!  How different an actress is!  Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?""  ""Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.""  ""Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.""  ""Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces.  There is an extraordinary charm in them, sometimes,"" said Lord Henry.  ""I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.""  ""You could not have helped telling me, Dorian.  All through your life you will tell me everything you do.""  ""Yes, Harry, I believe that is true.  I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me.  If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you.  You would understand me.""  ""People like you--the wilful sunbeams of life--don't commit crimes, Dorian.  But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.  And now tell me--reach me the matches, like a good boy--thanks--what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?""  Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. ""Harry!  Sibyl Vane is sacred!""  ""It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice.  ""But why should you be annoyed?  I suppose she will belong to you some day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a romance.  You know her, at any rate, I suppose?""  ""Of course I know her.  On the first night I was at the theatre, the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her.  I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.  I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.""  ""I am not surprised.""  ""Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers.  I told him I never even read them.  He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.""  ""I should not wonder if he was quite right there.  But, on the other hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all expensive.""  ""Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,"" laughed Dorian. ""By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go.  He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended.  I declined.  The next night, of course, I arrived at the place again.  When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art.  He was a most offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare.  He told me once, with an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to 'The Bard,' as he insisted on calling him.  He seemed to think it a distinction.""  ""It was a distinction, my dear Dorian--a great distinction.  Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life.  To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour.  But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?""  ""The third night.  She had been playing Rosalind.  I could not help going round.  I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me--at least I fancied that she had.  The old Jew was persistent.  He seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented.  It was curious my not wanting to know her, wasn't it?""  ""No; I don't think so.""  ""My dear Harry, why?""  ""I will tell you some other time.  Now I want to know about the girl.""  ""Sibyl?  Oh, she was so shy and so gentle.  There is something of a child about her.  Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power.  I think we were both rather nervous.  The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like children.  He would insist on calling me 'My Lord,' so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.  She said quite simply to me, 'You look more like a prince.  I must call you Prince Charming.'""  ""Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.""  ""You don't understand her, Harry.  She regarded me merely as a person in a play.  She knows nothing of life.  She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen better days.""  ""I know that look.  It depresses me,"" murmured Lord Henry, examining his rings.  ""The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest me.""  ""You were quite right.  There is always something infinitely mean about other people's tragedies.""  ""Sibyl is the only thing I care about.  What is it to me where she came from?  From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine.  Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every night she is more marvellous.""  ""That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now.  I thought you must have some curious romance on hand.  You have; but it is not quite what I expected.""  ""My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have been to the opera with you several times,"" said Dorian, opening his blue eyes in wonder.  ""You always come dreadfully late.""  ""Well, I can't help going to see Sibyl play,"" he cried, ""even if it is only for a single act.  I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe.""  ""You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can't you?""  He shook his head.  ""To-night she is Imogen,"" he answered, ""and to-morrow night she will be Juliet.""  ""When is she Sibyl Vane?""  ""Never.""  ""I congratulate you.""  ""How horrid you are!  She is all the great heroines of the world in one.  She is more than an individual.  You laugh, but I tell you she has genius.  I love her, and I must make her love me.  You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!  I want to make Romeo jealous.  I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad.  I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.  My God, Harry, how I worship her!""  He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.  Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.  He was terribly excited.  Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure.  How different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward's studio!  His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame.  Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way.  ""And what do you propose to do?"" said Lord Henry at last.  ""I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.  I have not the slightest fear of the result.  You are certain to acknowledge her genius.  Then we must get her out of the Jew's hands. She is bound to him for three years--at least for two years and eight months--from the present time.  I shall have to pay him something, of course.  When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly.  She will make the world as mad as she has made me.""  ""That would be impossible, my dear boy.""  ""Yes, she will.  She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age.""  ""Well, what night shall we go?""  ""Let me see.  To-day is Tuesday.  Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet to-morrow.""  ""All right.  The Bristol at eight o'clock; and I will get Basil.""  ""Not eight, Harry, please.  Half-past six.  We must be there before the curtain rises.  You must see her in the first act, where she meets Romeo.""  ""Half-past six!  What an hour!  It will be like having a meat-tea, or reading an English novel.  It must be seven.  No gentleman dines before seven.  Shall you see Basil between this and then?  Or shall I write to him?""  ""Dear Basil!  I have not laid eyes on him for a week.  It is rather horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I delight in it.  Perhaps you had better write to him.  I don't want to see him alone.  He says things that annoy me.  He gives me good advice.""  Lord Henry smiled.  ""People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves.  It is what I call the depth of generosity.""  ""Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine.  Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.""  ""Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work.  The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense.  The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.  Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are.  A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.  But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating.  The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look.  The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.  He lives the poetry that he cannot write.  The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.""  ""I wonder is that really so, Harry?"" said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on the table.  ""It must be, if you say it.  And now I am off. Imogen is waiting for me.  Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.""  As he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think.  Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.  He was pleased by it.  It made him a more interesting study.  He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import.  And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.  Human life--that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.  Compared to it there was nothing else of any value.  It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.  There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them.  There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature.  And, yet, what a great reward one received!  How wonderful the whole world became to one!  To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord--there was a delight in that!  What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.  He was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.  To a large extent the lad was his own creation.  He had made him premature.  That was something.  Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.  Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect.  But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.  Yes, the lad was premature.  He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring.  The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him.  With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.  He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.  Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!  There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.  Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!  Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?  Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?  The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.  He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.  As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value.  It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.  Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid.  But there was no motive power in experience.  It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.  It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results.  His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.  There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex passion.  What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.  It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.  Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious.  It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.  While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner.  He got up and looked out into the street.  The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.  The sky above was like a faded rose.  He thought of his friend's young fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end.  When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he saw a telegram lying on the hall table.  He opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray.  It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.      ""Mother, Mother, I am so happy!"" whispered the girl, burying her face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained.  ""I am so happy!"" she repeated, ""and you must be happy, too!""  Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her daughter's head.  ""Happy!"" she echoed, ""I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you act.  You must not think of anything but your acting.  Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.""  The girl looked up and pouted.  ""Money, Mother?"" she cried, ""what does money matter?  Love is more than money.""  ""Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James.  You must not forget that, Sibyl.  Fifty pounds is a very large sum.  Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.""  ""He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,"" said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.  ""I don't know how we could manage without him,"" answered the elder woman querulously.  Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.  ""We don't want him any more, Mother.  Prince Charming rules life for us now."" Then she paused.  A rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.  Quick breath parted the petals of her lips.  They trembled.  Some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.  ""I love him,"" she said simply.  ""Foolish child! foolish child!"" was the parrot-phrase flung in answer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the words.  The girl laughed again.  The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.  Her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret.  When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.  Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense.  She did not listen.  She was free in her prison of passion.  Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.  She had called on memory to remake him.  She had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back.  His kiss burned again upon her mouth.  Her eyelids were warm with his breath.  Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.  This young man might be rich.  If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.  The arrows of craft shot by her.  She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.  Suddenly she felt the need to speak.  The wordy silence troubled her. ""Mother"|2
19|", Mother,"" she cried, ""why does he love me so much?  I know why I love him.  I love him because he is like what love himself should be. But what does he see in me?  I am not worthy of him.  And yet--why, I cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him, I don't feel humble.  I feel proud, terribly proud.  Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince Charming?""  The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.  Sybil rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.  ""Forgive me, Mother.  I know it pains you to talk about our father.  But it only pains you because you loved him so much.  Don't look so sad.  I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago.  Ah! let me be happy for ever!""  ""My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.  Besides, what do you know of this young man?  You don't even know his name.  The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you should have shown more consideration.  However, as I said before, if he is rich ...""  ""Ah!  Mother, Mother, let me be happy!""  Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her arms.  At this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.  He was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement.  He was not so finely bred as his sister.  One would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.  Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.  She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.  She felt sure that the _tableau_ was interesting.  ""You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,"" said the lad with a good-natured grumble.  ""Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,"" she cried.  ""You are a dreadful old bear.""  And she ran across the room and hugged him.  James Vane looked into his sister's face with tenderness.  ""I want you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.  I don't suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again.  I am sure I don't want to.""  ""My son, don't say such dreadful things,"" murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.  She felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.  It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.  ""Why not, Mother?  I mean it.""  ""You pain me, my son.  I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence.  I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.""  ""Society!"" muttered the lad.  ""I don't want to know anything about that.  I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage.  I hate it.""  ""Oh, Jim!"" said Sibyl, laughing, ""how unkind of you!  But are you really going for a walk with me?  That will be nice!  I was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking it.  It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon.  Where shall we go?  Let us go to the park.""  ""I am too shabby,"" he answered, frowning.  ""Only swell people go to the park.""  ""Nonsense, Jim,"" she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.  He hesitated for a moment.  ""Very well,"" he said at last, ""but don't be too long dressing.""  She danced out of the door.  One could hear her singing as she ran upstairs.  Her little feet pattered overhead.  He walked up and down the room two or three times.  Then he turned to the still figure in the chair.  ""Mother, are my things ready?"" he asked.  ""Quite ready, James,"" she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.  For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers.  Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met.  She used to wonder if he suspected anything.  The silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her. She began to complain.  Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.  ""I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life,"" she said.  ""You must remember that it is your own choice.  You might have entered a solicitor's office.  Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families.""  ""I hate offices, and I hate clerks,"" he replied.  ""But you are quite right.  I have chosen my own life.  All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don't let her come to any harm.  Mother, you must watch over her.""  ""James, you really talk very strangely.  Of course I watch over Sibyl.""  ""I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her.  Is that right?  What about that?""  ""You are speaking about things you don't understand, James.  In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention.  I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.  That was when acting was really understood.  As for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not.  But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.  He is always most polite to me.  Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.""  ""You don't know his name, though,"" said the lad harshly.  ""No,"" answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.  ""He has not yet revealed his real name.  I think it is quite romantic of him.  He is probably a member of the aristocracy.""  James Vane bit his lip.  ""Watch over Sibyl, Mother,"" he cried, ""watch over her.""  ""My son, you distress me very much.  Sibyl is always under my special care.  Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him.  I trust he is one of the aristocracy.  He has all the appearance of it, I must say.  It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.  They would make a charming couple.  His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.""  The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his coarse fingers.  He had just turned round to say something when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.  ""How serious you both are!"" she cried.  ""What is the matter?""  ""Nothing,"" he answered.  ""I suppose one must be serious sometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock. Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.""  ""Good-bye, my son,"" she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.  She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.  ""Kiss me, Mother,"" said the girl.  Her flowerlike lips touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost.  ""My child! my child!"" cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery.  ""Come, Sibyl,"" said her brother impatiently.  He hated his mother's affectations.  They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary Euston Road.  The passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.  He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.  Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger.  He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.  Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.  Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.  She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers.  For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.  Oh, no!  A sailor's existence was dreadful.  Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!  He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen.  The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.  Or, no.  He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.  They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language.  He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.  Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.  Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.  But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.  She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.  He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep.  God was very good, and would watch over him.  She would pray for him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.  The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.  He was heart-sick at leaving home.  Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl's position.  This young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good.  He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.  He was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness. Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.  His mother!  He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that he had brooded on for many months of silence.  A chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of horrible thoughts.  He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face.  His brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.  ""You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,"" cried Sibyl, ""and I am making the most delightful plans for your future.  Do say something.""  ""What do you want me to say?""  ""Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,"" she answered, smiling at him.  He shrugged his shoulders.  ""You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, Sibyl.""  She flushed.  ""What do you mean, Jim?"" she asked.  ""You have a new friend, I hear.  Who is he?  Why have you not told me about him?  He means you no good.""  ""Stop, Jim!"" she exclaimed.  ""You must not say anything against him.  I love him.""  ""Why, you don't even know his name,"" answered the lad.  ""Who is he?  I have a right to know.""  ""He is called Prince Charming.  Don't you like the name.  Oh! you silly boy! you should never forget it.  If you only saw him, you would think him the most wonderful person in the world.  Some day you will meet him--when you come back from Australia.  You will like him so much. Everybody likes him, and I ... love him.  I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it!  Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have him sitting there!  To play for his delight!  I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them.  To be in love is to surpass one's self.  Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting 'genius' to his loafers at the bar.  He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will announce me as a revelation.  I feel it.  And it is all his, his only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces.  But I am poor beside him.  Poor?  What does that matter?  When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window.  Our proverbs want rewriting.  They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.""  ""He is a gentleman,"" said the lad sullenly.  ""A prince!"" she cried musically.  ""What more do you want?""  ""He wants to enslave you.""  ""I shudder at the thought of being free.""  ""I want you to beware of him.""  ""To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.""  ""Sibyl, you are mad about him.""  She laughed and took his arm.  ""You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred.  Some day you will be in love yourself.  Then you will know what it is.  Don't look so sulky.  Surely you should be glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have ever been before.  Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and difficult.  But it will be different now.  You are going to a new world, and I have found one.  Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by.""  They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers.  The tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire.  A white dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air. The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.  She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.  He spoke slowly and with effort.  They passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters.  Sibyl felt oppressed.  She could not communicate her joy.  A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win.  After some time she became silent.  Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.  She started to her feet.  ""There he is!"" she cried.  ""Who?"" said Jim Vane.  ""Prince Charming,"" she answered, looking after the victoria.  He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm.  ""Show him to me. Which is he?  Point him out.  I must see him!"" he exclaimed; but at that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.  ""He is gone,"" murmured Sibyl sadly.  ""I wish you had seen him.""  ""I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him.""  She looked at him in horror.  He repeated his words.  They cut the air like a dagger.  The people round began to gape.  A lady standing close to her tittered.  ""Come away, Jim; come away,"" she whispered.  He followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd.  He felt glad at what he had said.  When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round.  There was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips.  She shook her head at him.  ""You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all.  How can you say such horrible things?  You don't know what you are talking about.  You are simply jealous and unkind.  Ah!  I wish you would fall in love.  Love makes people good, and what you said was wicked.""  ""I am sixteen,"" he answered, ""and I know what I am about.  Mother is no help to you.  She doesn't understand how to look after you.  I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all.  I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up.  I would, if my articles hadn't been signed.""  ""Oh, don't be so serious, Jim.  You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in.  I am not going to quarrel with you.  I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect happiness.  We won't quarrel.  I know you would never harm any one I love, would you?""  ""Not as long as you love him, I suppose,"" was the sullen answer.  ""I shall love him for ever!"" she cried.  ""And he?""  ""For ever, too!""  ""He had better.""  She shrank from him.  Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.  He was merely a boy.  At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their shabby home in the Euston Road.  It was after five o'clock, and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting.  Jim insisted that she should do so.  He said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present.  She would be sure to make a scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.  In Sybil's own room they parted.  There was jealousy in the lad's heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him, had come between them.  Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her with real affection.  There were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs.  His mother was waiting for him below.  She grumbled at his unpunctuality, as he entered.  He made no answer, but sat down to his meagre meal.  The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth.  Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him.  After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands.  He felt that he had a right to know.  It should have been told to him before, if it was as he suspected.  Leaden with fear, his mother watched him.  Words dropped mechanically from her lips.  A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers.  When the clock struck six, he got up and went to the door.  Then he turned back and looked at her. Their eyes met.  In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy.  It enraged him.  ""Mother, I have something to ask you,"" he said.  Her eyes wandered vaguely about the room.  She made no answer.  ""Tell me the truth.  I have a right to know.  Were you married to my father?""  She heaved a deep sigh.  It was a sigh of relief.  The terrible moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she felt no terror.  Indeed, in some measure it was a disappointment to her.  The vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer.  The situation had not been gradually led up to.  It was crude.  It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.  ""No,"" she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.  ""My father was a scoundrel then!"" cried the lad, clenching his fists.  She shook her head.  ""I knew he was not free.  We loved each other very much.  If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.  Don't speak against him, my son.  He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he was highly connected.""  An oath broke from his lips.  ""I don't care for myself,"" he exclaimed, ""but don't let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love with her, or says he is?  Highly connected, too, I suppose.""  For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman.  Her head drooped.  She wiped her eyes with shaking hands.  ""Sibyl has a mother,"" she murmured; ""I had none.""  The lad was touched.  He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed her.  ""I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,"" he said, ""but I could not help it.  I must go now.  Good-bye. Don't forget that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog.  I swear it.""  The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her.  She was familiar with the atmosphere.  She breathed more freely, and for the first time for many months she really admired her son.  She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short.  Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for.  The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman.  The moment was lost in vulgar details.  It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.  She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted.  She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after.  She remembered the phrase.  It had pleased her.  Of the threat she said nothing.  It was vividly and dramatically expressed.  She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.      ""I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?"" said Lord Henry that evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.  ""No, Harry,"" answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter.  ""What is it?  Nothing about politics, I hope!  They don't interest me.  There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing.""  ""Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,"" said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.  Hallward started and then frowned.  ""Dorian engaged to be married!"" he cried.  ""Impossible!""  ""It is perfectly true.""  ""To whom?""  ""To some little actress or other.""  ""I can't believe it.  Dorian is far too sensible.""  ""Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear Basil.""  ""Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.""  ""Except in America,"" rejoined Lord Henry languidly.  ""But I didn't say he was married.  I said he was engaged to be married.  There is a great difference.  I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged.  I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.""  ""But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth.  It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.""  ""If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.  He is sure to do it, then.  Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.""  ""I hope the girl is good, Harry.  I don't want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect.""  ""Oh, she is better than good--she is beautiful,"" murmured Lord Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. ""Dorian says she is beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind.  Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people.  It has had that excellent effect, amongst others.  We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his appointment.""  ""Are you serious?""  ""Quite serious, Basil.  I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment.""  ""But do you approve of it, Harry?"" asked the painter, walking up and down the room and biting his lip.  ""You can't approve of it, possibly. It is some silly infatuation.""  ""I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now.  It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.  We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices.  I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.  If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me.  Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her.  Why not? If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting.  You know I am not a champion of marriage.  The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish.  And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality.  Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex.  They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos.  They are forced to have more than one life.  They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence.  Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience.  I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else.  He would be a wonderful study.""  ""You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don't. If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself.  You are much better than you pretend to be.""  Lord Henry laughed.  ""The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves.  The basis of optimism is sheer terror.  We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us.  We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets.  I mean everything that I have said.  I have the greatest contempt for optimism.  As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested.  If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it.  As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly encourage them.  They have the charm of being fashionable.  But here is Dorian himself.  He will tell you more than I can.""  ""My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!"" said the lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn.  ""I have never been so happy.  Of course, it is sudden--all really delightful things are.  And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life."" He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome.  ""I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,"" said Hallward, ""but I don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement. You let Harry know.""  ""And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner,"" broke in Lord Henry, putting his hand on the lad's shoulder and smiling as he spoke. ""Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about.""  ""There is really not much to tell,"" cried Dorian as they took their seats at the small round table.  ""What happened was simply this.  After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre.  Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd.  But Sibyl! You should have seen her!  When she came on in her boy's clothes, she was perfectly wonderful.  She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red.  She had never seemed to me more exquisite.  She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil.  Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose.  As for her acting--well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist.  I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled.  I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century.  I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen.  After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her.  As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before.  My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other.  I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment.  It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy.  She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus.  Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands.  I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help it.  Of course, our engagement is a dead s"|2
20|"ecret.  She has not even told her own mother.  I don't know what my guardians will say.  Lord Radley is sure to be furious.  I don't care.  I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like.  I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare's plays?  Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.  I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.""  ""Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,"" said Hallward slowly.  ""Have you seen her to-day?"" asked Lord Henry.  Dorian Gray shook his head.  ""I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall find her in an orchard in Verona.""  Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.  ""At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian?  And what did she say in answer?  Perhaps you forgot all about it.""  ""My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal.  I told her that I loved her, and she said she was not worthy to be my wife.  Not worthy!  Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her.""  ""Women are wonderfully practical,"" murmured Lord Henry, ""much more practical than we are.  In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.""  Hallward laid his hand upon his arm.  ""Don't, Harry.  You have annoyed Dorian.  He is not like other men.  He would never bring misery upon any one.  His nature is too fine for that.""  Lord Henry looked across the table.  ""Dorian is never annoyed with me,"" he answered.  ""I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any question--simple curiosity.  I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.  Except, of course, in middle-class life.  But then the middle classes are not modern.""  Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head.  ""You are quite incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind.  It is impossible to be angry with you.  When you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast, a beast without a heart.  I cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves.  I love Sibyl Vane.  I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine.  What is marriage?  An irrevocable vow.  You mock at it for that.  Ah! don't mock.  It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take.  Her trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good.  When I am with her, I regret all that you have taught me.  I become different from what you have known me to be.  I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.""  ""And those are ...?"" asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.  ""Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure.  All your theories, in fact, Harry.""  ""Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,"" he answered in his slow melodious voice.  ""But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory as my own.  It belongs to Nature, not to me.  Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval.  When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.""  ""Ah! but what do you mean by good?"" cried Basil Hallward.  ""Yes,"" echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table, ""what do you mean by good, Harry?""  ""To be good is to be in harmony with one's self,"" he replied, touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers. ""Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.  One's own life--that is the important thing.  As for the lives of one's neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one's moral views about them, but they are not one's concern.  Besides, individualism has really the higher aim.  Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age.  I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.""  ""But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one pays a terrible price for doing so?"" suggested the painter.  ""Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays.  I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.""  ""One has to pay in other ways but money.""  ""What sort of ways, Basil?""  ""Oh!  I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the consciousness of degradation.""  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  ""My dear fellow, mediaeval art is charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date.  One can use them in fiction, of course.  But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact.  Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is.""  ""I know what pleasure is,"" cried Dorian Gray.  ""It is to adore some one.""  ""That is certainly better than being adored,"" he answered, toying with some fruits.  ""Being adored is a nuisance.  Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods.  They worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them.""  ""I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us,"" murmured the lad gravely.  ""They create love in our natures.  They have a right to demand it back.""  ""That is quite true, Dorian,"" cried Hallward.  ""Nothing is ever quite true,"" said Lord Henry.  ""This is,"" interrupted Dorian.  ""You must admit, Harry, that women give to men the very gold of their lives.""  ""Possibly,"" he sighed, ""but they invariably want it back in such very small change.  That is the worry.  Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.""  ""Harry, you are dreadful!  I don't know why I like you so much.""  ""You will always like me, Dorian,"" he replied.  ""Will you have some coffee, you fellows?  Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and some cigarettes.  No, don't mind the cigarettes--I have some.  Basil, I can't allow you to smoke cigars.  You must have a cigarette.  A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.  What more can one want?  Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me.  I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.""  ""What nonsense you talk, Harry!"" cried the lad, taking a light from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table. ""Let us go down to the theatre.  When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life.  She will represent something to you that you have never known.""  ""I have known everything,"" said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his eyes, ""but I am always ready for a new emotion.  I am afraid, however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing.  Still, your wonderful girl may thrill me.  I love acting.  It is so much more real than life.  Let us go.  Dorian, you will come with me.  I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.  You must follow us in a hansom.""  They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing.  The painter was silent and preoccupied.  There was a gloom over him.  He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened.  After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs.  He drove off by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him.  A strange sense of loss came over him.  He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past.  Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes.  When the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.      For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile.  He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice.  Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever.  He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban.  Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.  At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet.  Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit.  The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire.  The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.  They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them.  Some women were laughing in the pit.  Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant.  The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.  ""What a place to find one's divinity in!"" said Lord Henry.  ""Yes!"" answered Dorian Gray.  ""It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things.  When she acts, you will forget everything.  These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.  They sit silently and watch her.  They weep and laugh as she wills them to do.  She makes them as responsive as a violin.  She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self.""  ""The same flesh and blood as one's self!  Oh, I hope not!"" exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.  ""Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian,"" said the painter.  ""I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.  Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble.  To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth doing.  If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world.  This marriage is quite right.  I did not think so at first, but I admit it now.  The gods made Sibyl Vane for you.  Without her you would have been incomplete.""  ""Thanks, Basil,"" answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand.  ""I knew that you would understand me.  Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me.  But here is the orchestra.  It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five minutes.  Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me.""  A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.  Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at--one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen.  There was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes.  A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house.  She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble.  Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, ""Charming! charming!""  The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends.  The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.  Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world.  Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in the water.  The curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily.  Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.  Yet she was curiously listless.  She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on Romeo.  The few words she had to speak--      Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,         Which mannerly devotion shows in this;     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,         And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss--  with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner.  The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false.  It was wrong in colour.  It took away all the life from the verse.  It made the passion unreal.  Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.  He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him.  She seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent.  They were horribly disappointed.  Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act.  They waited for that.  If she failed there, there was nothing in her.  She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.  That could not be denied.  But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she went on.  Her gestures became absurdly artificial.  She overemphasized everything that she had to say.  The beautiful passage--      Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night--  was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--          Although I joy in thee,     I have no joy of this contract to-night:     It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be     Ere one can say, ""It lightens.""  Sweet, good-night!     This bud of love by summer's ripening breath     May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet--  she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.  Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was the girl herself.  When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat.  ""She is quite beautiful, Dorian,"" he said, ""but she can't act.  Let us go.""  ""I am going to see the play through,"" answered the lad, in a hard bitter voice.  ""I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry.  I apologize to you both.""  ""My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,"" interrupted Hallward.  ""We will come some other night.""  ""I wish she were ill,"" he rejoined.  ""But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold.  She has entirely altered.  Last night she was a great artist.  This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.""  ""Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.  Love is a more wonderful thing than art.""  ""They are both simply forms of imitation,"" remarked Lord Henry.  ""But do let us go.  Dorian, you must not stay here any longer.  It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.  Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll?  She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.  There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating--people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.  Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.  Come to the club with Basil and myself.  We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.  She is beautiful. What more can you want?""  ""Go away, Harry,"" cried the lad.  ""I want to be alone.  Basil, you must go.  Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking?""  The hot tears came to his eyes.  His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.  ""Let us go, Basil,"" said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his voice, and the two young men passed out together.  A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act.  Dorian Gray went back to his seat.  He looked pale, and proud, and indifferent.  The play dragged on, and seemed interminable.  Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots and laughing.  The whole thing was a _fiasco_.  The last act was played to almost empty benches.  The curtain went down on a titter and some groans.  As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom.  The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on her face.  Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.  There was a radiance about her.  Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own.  When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over her.  ""How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!"" she cried.  ""Horribly!"" he answered, gazing at her in amazement.  ""Horribly!  It was dreadful.  Are you ill?  You have no idea what it was.  You have no idea what I suffered.""  The girl smiled.  ""Dorian,"" she answered, lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth.  ""Dorian, you should have understood.  But you understand now, don't you?""  ""Understand what?"" he asked, angrily.  ""Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad.  Why I shall never act well again.""  He shrugged his shoulders.  ""You are ill, I suppose.  When you are ill you shouldn't act.  You make yourself ridiculous.  My friends were bored.  I was bored.""  She seemed not to listen to him.  She was transfigured with joy.  An ecstasy of happiness dominated her.  ""Dorian, Dorian,"" she cried, ""before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life.  It was only in the theatre that I lived.  I thought that it was all true.  I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.  The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also.  I believed in everything.  The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike.  The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real.  You came--oh, my beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison.  You taught me what reality really is.  To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played.  To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say.  You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.  You had made me understand what love really is.  My love!  My love!  Prince Charming!  Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows.  You are more to me than all art can ever be.  What have I to do with the puppets of a play?  When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me.  I thought that I was going to be wonderful.  I found that I could do nothing.  Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me.  I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours?  Take me away, Dorian--take me away with you, where we can be quite alone.  I hate the stage.  I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire.  Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies?  Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love.  You have made me see that.""  He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face.  ""You have killed my love,"" he muttered.  She looked at him in wonder and laughed.  He made no answer.  She came across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.  She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.  He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.  Then he leaped up and went to the door.  ""Yes,"" he cried, ""you have killed my love.  You used to stir my imagination.  Now you don't even stir my curiosity.  You simply produce no effect.  I loved you because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.  You have thrown it all away.  You are shallow and stupid.  My God! how mad I was to love you!  What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now.  I will never see you again.  I will never think of you.  I will never mention your name.  You don't know what you were to me, once.  Why, once ... Oh, I can't bear to think of it!  I wish I had never laid eyes upon you!  You have spoiled the romance of my life.  How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your art, you are nothing.  I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent.  The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.  What are you now?  A third-rate actress with a pretty face.""  The girl grew white, and trembled.  She clenched her hands together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat.  ""You are not serious, Dorian?"" she murmured.  ""You are acting.""  ""Acting!  I leave that to you.  You do it so well,"" he answered bitterly.  She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her face, came across the room to him.  She put her hand upon his arm and looked into his eyes.  He thrust her back.  ""Don't touch me!"" he cried.  A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay there like a trampled flower.  ""Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!"" she whispered.  ""I am so sorry I didn't act well.  I was thinking of you all the time.  But I will try--indeed, I will try.  It came so suddenly across me, my love for you.  I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me--if we had not kissed each other.  Kiss me again, my love.  Don't go away from me.  I couldn't bear it.  Oh! don't go away from me.  My brother ... No; never mind.  He didn't mean it.  He was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and try to improve.  Don't be cruel to me, because I love you better than anything in the world.  After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you.  But you are quite right, Dorian.  I should have shown myself more of an artist.  It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn't help it.  Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me."" A fit of passionate sobbing choked her.  She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.  There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.  Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed him.  ""I am going,"" he said at last in his calm clear voice.  ""I don't wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again.  You have disappointed me.""  She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer.  Her little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him.  He turned on his heel and left the room.  In a few moments he was out of the theatre.  Where he went to he hardly knew.  He remembered wandering through dimly lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses.  Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him.  Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes.  He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.  As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden. The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl.  Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.  The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain.  He followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons.  A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries.  He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly.  They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.  A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of vegetables.  Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over.  Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.  The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.  Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.  After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home.  For a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it.  From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising.  It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.  In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.  He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.  As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him.  He started back as if in surprise. Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.  After he had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.  In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.  The expression looked different.  One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth.  It was certainly strange.  He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.  The bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.  But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even.  The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.  He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him, glanced hurriedly into its polished depths.  No line like that warped his red lips.  What did it mean?  He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again.  There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered.  It was not a mere fancy of his own.  The thing was horribly apparent.  He threw himself into a chair and began to think.  Suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio"|2
21|" the day the picture had been finished.  Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.  Surely his wish had not been fulfilled?  Such things were impossible.  It seemed monstrous even to think of them.  And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.  Cruelty!  Had he been cruel?  It was the girl's fault, not his.  He had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great.  Then she had disappointed him.  She had been shallow and unworthy.  And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child.  He remembered with what callousness he had watched her.  Why had he been made like that?  Why had such a soul been given to him? But he had suffered also.  During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture.  His life was well worth hers.  She had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age.  Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men.  They lived on their emotions.  They only thought of their emotions.  When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes.  Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were.  Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane?  She was nothing to him now.  But the picture?  What was he to say of that?  It held the secret of his life, and told his story.  It had taught him to love his own beauty.  Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?  Would he ever look at it again?  No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.  The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad.  The picture had not changed.  It was folly to think so.  Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile.  Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.  Its blue eyes met his own.  A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him.  It had altered already, and would alter more.  Its gold would wither into grey.  Its red and white roses would die.  For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness.  But he would not sin.  The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience.  He would resist temptation.  He would not see Lord Henry any more--would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things.  He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again.  Yes, it was his duty to do so.  She must have suffered more than he had.  Poor child!  He had been selfish and cruel to her.  The fascination that she had exercised over him would return.  They would be happy together.  His life with her would be beautiful and pure.  He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.  ""How horrible!"" he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.  When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath.  The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.  He thought only of Sibyl.  A faint echo of his love came back to him.  He repeated her name over and over again.  The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.      It was long past noon when he awoke.  His valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late.  Finally his bell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.  ""Monsieur has well slept this morning,"" he said, smiling.  ""What o'clock is it, Victor?"" asked Dorian Gray drowsily.  ""One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.""  How late it was!  He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his letters.  One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning.  He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened listlessly.  They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season.  There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.  After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom.  The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.  He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through.  A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.  As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window.  It was an exquisite day.  The warm air seemed laden with spices.  A bee flew in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before him.  He felt perfectly happy.  Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait, and he started.  ""Too cold for Monsieur?"" asked his valet, putting an omelette on the table.  ""I shut the window?""  Dorian shook his head.  ""I am not cold,"" he murmured.  Was it all true?  Had the portrait really changed?  Or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy?  Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing was absurd.  It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It would make him smile.  And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!  First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips.  He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room.  He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait.  He was afraid of certainty.  When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain.  As the door was closing behind him, he called him back.  The man stood waiting for his orders.  Dorian looked at him for a moment.  ""I am not at home to any one, Victor,"" he said with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.  Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.  The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.  He scanned it curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life.  Should he move it aside, after all?  Why not let it stay there?  What was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible.  If it was not true, why trouble about it?  But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?  What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own picture?  Basil would be sure to do that.  No; the thing had to be examined, and at once.  Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.  He got up and locked both doors.  At least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame.  Then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face.  It was perfectly true.  The portrait had altered.  As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest.  That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him.  And yet it was a fact.  Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?  Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true?  Or was there some other, more terrible reason?  He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.  One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him.  It had made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.  It was not too late to make reparation for that.  She could still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all.  There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep.  But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.  Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.  Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir.  He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering.  He did not know what to do, or what to think.  Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.  He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of pain.  There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us.  It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.  When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.  Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside.  ""My dear boy, I must see you.  Let me in at once.  I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this.""  He made no answer at first, but remained quite still.  The knocking still continued and grew louder.  Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable.  He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.  ""I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry as he entered. ""But you must not think too much about it.""  ""Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?"" asked the lad.  ""Yes, of course,"" answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves.  ""It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault.  Tell me, did you go behind and see her, after the play was over?""  ""Yes.""  ""I felt sure you had.  Did you make a scene with her?""  ""I was brutal, Harry--perfectly brutal.  But it is all right now.  I am not sorry for anything that has happened.  It has taught me to know myself better.""  ""Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!  I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.""  ""I have got through all that,"" said Dorian, shaking his head and smiling.  ""I am perfectly happy now.  I know what conscience is, to begin with.  It is not what you told me it was.  It is the divinest thing in us.  Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before me.  I want to be good.  I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous.""  ""A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian!  I congratulate you on it.  But how are you going to begin?""  ""By marrying Sibyl Vane.""  ""Marrying Sibyl Vane!"" cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him in perplexed amazement.  ""But, my dear Dorian--""  ""Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say.  Something dreadful about marriage.  Don't say it.  Don't ever say things of that kind to me again.  Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me.  I am not going to break my word to her.  She is to be my wife.""  ""Your wife!  Dorian! ... Didn't you get my letter?  I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man.""  ""Your letter?  Oh, yes, I remember.  I have not read it yet, Harry.  I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like.  You cut life to pieces with your epigrams.""  ""You know nothing then?""  ""What do you mean?""  Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray, took both his hands in his own and held them tightly.  ""Dorian,"" he said, ""my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.""  A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry's grasp.  ""Dead!  Sibyl dead! It is not true!  It is a horrible lie!  How dare you say it?""  ""It is quite true, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry, gravely.  ""It is in all the morning papers.  I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came.  There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it.  Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.  But in London people are so prejudiced.  Here, one should never make one's _debut_ with a scandal.  One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age.  I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre?  If they don't, it is all right.  Did any one see you going round to her room?  That is an important point.""  Dorian did not answer for a few moments.  He was dazed with horror. Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, ""Harry, did you say an inquest?  What did you mean by that?  Did Sibyl--? Oh, Harry, I can't bear it!  But be quick.  Tell me everything at once.""  ""I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public.  It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something upstairs.  They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again.  They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres.  I don't know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it.  I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.""  ""Harry, Harry, it is terrible!"" cried the lad.  ""Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it.  I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen.  I should have thought she was almost younger than that.  She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting.  Dorian, you mustn't let this thing get on your nerves.  You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the opera.  It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there.  You can come to my sister's box.  She has got some smart women with her.""  ""So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,"" said Dorian Gray, half to himself, ""murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife. Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that.  The birds sing just as happily in my garden.  And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards.  How extraordinarily dramatic life is!  If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.  Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life.  Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl.  Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead?  Sibyl!  Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!  It seems years ago to me now.  She was everything to me.  Then came that dreadful night--was it really only last night?--when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She explained it all to me.  It was terribly pathetic.  But I was not moved a bit.  I thought her shallow.  Suddenly something happened that made me afraid.  I can't tell you what it was, but it was terrible.  I said I would go back to her.  I felt I had done wrong.  And now she is dead.  My God!  My God!  Harry, what shall I do?  You don't know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.  She would have done that for me.  She had no right to kill herself.  It was selfish of her.""  ""My dear Dorian,"" answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case and producing a gold-latten matchbox, ""the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life.  If you had married this girl, you would have been wretched.  Of course, you would have treated her kindly.  One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.  But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her.  And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for.  I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been abject--which, of course, I would not have allowed--but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.""  ""I suppose it would,"" muttered the lad, walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale.  ""But I thought it was my duty.  It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.  I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions--that they are always made too late.  Mine certainly were.""  ""Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws.  Their origin is pure vanity.  Their result is absolutely _nil_. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak.  That is all that can be said for them.  They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.""  ""Harry,"" cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him, ""why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?  I don't think I am heartless.  Do you?""  ""You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,"" answered Lord Henry with his sweet melancholy smile.  The lad frowned.  ""I don't like that explanation, Harry,"" he rejoined, ""but I am glad you don't think I am heartless.  I am nothing of the kind.  I know I am not.  And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should.  It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.  It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but by which I have not been wounded.""  ""It is an interesting question,"" said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, ""an extremely interesting question.  I fancy that the true explanation is this:  It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.  They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.  They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives.  If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.  Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play.  Or rather we are both.  We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us.  In the present case, what is it that has really happened?  Some one has killed herself for love of you.  I wish that I had ever had such an experience.  It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life.  The people who have adored me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me.  They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences.  That awful memory of woman!  What a fearful thing it is!  And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals!  One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details.  Details are always vulgar.""  ""I must sow poppies in my garden,"" sighed Dorian.  ""There is no necessity,"" rejoined his companion.  ""Life has always poppies in her hands.  Of course, now and then things linger.  I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die.  Ultimately, however, it did die.  I forget what killed it.  I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me.  That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity.  Well--would you believe it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future.  I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.  She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life.  I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.  But what a lack of taste she showed!  The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen.  They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it.  If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.  They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art.  You are more fortunate than I am.  I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.  Ordinary women always console themselves.  Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours.  Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.  It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.  They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.  Religion consoles some.  Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.  Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.  Conscience makes egotists of us all.  Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life.  Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.""  ""What is that, Harry?"" said the lad listlessly.  ""Oh, the obvious consolation.  Taking some one else's admirer when one loses one's own.  In good society that always whitewashes a woman.  But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets!  There is something to me quite beautiful about her death.  I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love.""  ""I was terribly cruel to her.  You forget that.""  ""I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else.  They have wonderfully primitive instincts.  We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same.  They love being dominated.  I am sure you were splendid.  I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked.  And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to everything.""  ""What was that, Harry?""  ""You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance--that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.""  ""She will never come to life again now,"" muttered the lad, burying his face in his hands.  ""No, she will never come to life.  She has played her last part.  But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.  The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died.  To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of joy.  The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.  Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled.  Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died.  But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane.  She was less real than they are.""  There was a silence.  The evening darkened in the room.  Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.  The colours faded wearily out of things.  After some time Dorian Gray looked up.  ""You have explained me to myself, Harry,"" he murmured with something of a sigh of relief.  ""I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself.  How well you know me!  But we will not talk again of what has happened.  It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.  I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.""  ""Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.  There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.""  ""But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled?  What then?""  ""Ah, then,"" said Lord Henry, rising to go, ""then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories.  As it is, they are brought to you.  No, you must keep your good looks.  We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.  We cannot spare you.  And now you had better dress and drive down to the club.  We are rather late, as it is.""  ""I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry.  I feel too tired to eat anything.  What is the number of your sister's box?""  ""Twenty-seven, I believe.  It is on the grand tier.  You will see her name on the door.  But I am sorry you won't come and dine.""  ""I don't feel up to it,"" said Dorian listlessly.  ""But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me.  You are certainly my best friend.  No one has ever understood me as you have.""  ""We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,"" answered Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand.  ""Good-bye. I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope.  Remember, Patti is singing.""  As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. He waited impatiently for him to go.  The man seemed to take an interminable time over everything.  As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back.  No; there was no further change in the picture.  It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he had known of it himself.  It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred.  The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was.  Or was it indifferent to results?  Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul"|2
22|"?  He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.  Poor Sibyl!  What a romance it had all been!  She had often mimicked death on the stage.  Then Death himself had touched her and taken her with him.  How had she played that dreadful last scene?  Had she cursed him, as she died?  No; she had died for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now.  She had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life.  He would not think any more of what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.  When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of love.  A wonderful tragic figure?  Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace.  He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.  He felt that the time had really come for making his choice.  Or had his choice already been made?  Yes, life had decided that for him--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life.  Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins--he was to have all these things.  The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.  A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas.  Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him.  Morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times.  Was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded?  Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!  For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease.  It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged.  And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control?  Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution?  Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all?  If thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things?  Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance.  He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power.  If the picture was to alter, it was to alter.  That was all.  Why inquire too closely into it?  For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.  He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places.  This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors.  As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul.  And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.  When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade.  Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken.  Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous.  What did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas?  He would be safe.  That was everything.  He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was already waiting for him.  An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.      As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.  ""I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,"" he said gravely.  ""I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera.  Of course, I knew that was impossible.  But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.  I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another.  I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first.  I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club.  I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you.  I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.  I know what you must suffer. But where were you?  Did you go down and see the girl's mother?  For a moment I thought of following you there.  They gave the address in the paper.  Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it?  But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.  Poor woman!  What a state she must be in!  And her only child, too!  What did she say about it all?""  ""My dear Basil, how do I know?"" murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored.  ""I was at the opera.  You should have come on there.  I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first time.  We were in her box.  She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.  Don't talk about horrid subjects.  If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened.  It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.  I may mention that she was not the woman's only child.  There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.  But he is not on the stage.  He is a sailor, or something.  And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting.""  ""You went to the opera?"" said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice.  ""You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?  You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?  Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!""  ""Stop, Basil!  I won't hear it!"" cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. ""You must not tell me about things.  What is done is done.  What is past is past.""  ""You call yesterday the past?""  ""What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?  It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.  A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.  I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions.  I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.""  ""Dorian, this is horrible!  Something has changed you completely.  You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture.  But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then.  You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world.  Now, I don't know what has come over you.  You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.  It is all Harry's influence.  I see that.""  The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.  ""I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil,"" he said at last, ""more than I owe to you.  You only taught me to be vain.""  ""Well, I am punished for that, Dorian--or shall be some day.""  ""I don't know what you mean, Basil,"" he exclaimed, turning round.  ""I don't know what you want.  What do you want?""  ""I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,"" said the artist sadly.  ""Basil,"" said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder, ""you have come too late.  Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself--""  ""Killed herself!  Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?"" cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.  ""My dear Basil!  Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident?  Of course she killed herself.""  The elder man buried his face in his hands.  ""How fearful,"" he muttered, and a shudder ran through him.  ""No,"" said Dorian Gray, ""there is nothing fearful about it.  It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age.  As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives.  They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious.  You know what I mean--middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing.  How different Sibyl was!  She lived her finest tragedy.  She was always a heroine.  The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love.  When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.  She passed again into the sphere of art.  There is something of the martyr about her.  Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.  But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered.  If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears.  Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.  I suffered immensely.  Then it passed away.  I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists.  And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me.  That is charming of you.  You find me consoled, and you are furious.  How like a sympathetic person!  You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.  He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope.  And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view.  Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la consolation des arts_?  I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.  Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.  I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.  Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these.  But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me.  To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life.  I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this.  You have not realized how I have developed.  I was a schoolboy when you knew me.  I am a man now.  I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas.  I am different, but you must not like me less.  I am changed, but you must always be my friend.  Of course, I am very fond of Harry.  But I know that you are better than he is.  You are not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better.  And how happy we used to be together!  Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me.  I am what I am.  There is nothing more to be said.""  The painter felt strangely moved.  The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality had been the great turning point in his art.  He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more.  After all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.  There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.  ""Well, Dorian,"" he said at length, with a sad smile, ""I won't speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.  I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it.  The inquest is to take place this afternoon.  Have they summoned you?""  Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word ""inquest.""  There was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind.  ""They don't know my name,"" he answered.  ""But surely she did?""  ""Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one.  She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming.  It was pretty of her.  You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil.  I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.""  ""I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.  But you must come and sit to me yourself again.  I can't get on without you.""  ""I can never sit to you again, Basil.  It is impossible!"" he exclaimed, starting back.  The painter stared at him.  ""My dear boy, what nonsense!"" he cried. ""Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you?  Where is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it?  Let me look at it.  It is the best thing I have ever done.  Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that.  I felt the room looked different as I came in.""  ""My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.  You don't imagine I let him arrange my room for me?  He settles my flowers for me sometimes--that is all.  No; I did it myself.  The light was too strong on the portrait.""  ""Too strong!  Surely not, my dear fellow?  It is an admirable place for it.  Let me see it.""  And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.  A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between the painter and the screen.  ""Basil,"" he said, looking very pale, ""you must not look at it.  I don't wish you to.""  ""Not look at my own work!  You are not serious.  Why shouldn't I look at it?"" exclaimed Hallward, laughing.  ""If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live.  I am quite serious.  I don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.  But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us.""  Hallward was thunderstruck.  He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement.  He had never seen him like this before.  The lad was actually pallid with rage.  His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire.  He was trembling all over.  ""Dorian!""  ""Don't speak!""  ""But what is the matter?  Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to,"" he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window.  ""But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn.  I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?""  ""To exhibit it!  You want to exhibit it?"" exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him.  Was the world going to be shown his secret?  Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That was impossible.  Something--he did not know what--had to be done at once.  ""Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that.  Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October.  The portrait will only be away a month.  I should think you could easily spare it for that time.  In fact, you are sure to be out of town.  And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it.""  Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.  There were beads of perspiration there.  He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger.  ""You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,"" he cried.  ""Why have you changed your mind?  You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have.  The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless.  You can't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition.  You told Harry exactly the same thing."" He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes.  He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in jest, ""If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won't exhibit your picture.  He told me why he wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me.""  Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.  He would ask him and try.  ""Basil,"" he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face, ""we have each of us a secret.  Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine.  What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?""  The painter shuddered in spite of himself.  ""Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.  I could not bear your doing either of those two things.  If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content.  I have always you to look at.  If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied.  Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation.""  ""No, Basil, you must tell me,"" insisted Dorian Gray.  ""I think I have a right to know.""  His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place.  He was determined to find out Basil Hallward's mystery.  ""Let us sit down, Dorian,"" said the painter, looking troubled.  ""Let us sit down.  And just answer me one question.  Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?""  ""Basil!"" cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.  ""I see you did.  Don't speak.  Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me.  I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you.  You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.  I worshipped you.  I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.  I wanted to have you all to myself.  I was only happy when I was with you.  When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about this.  It would have been impossible.  You would not have understood it.  I hardly understood it myself.  I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....  Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.  Then came a new development.  I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile.  You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of your own face.  And it had all been what art should be--unconscious, ideal, and remote.  One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time.  Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell.  But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.  I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry.  I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.  Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.  You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.  But I did not mind that.  When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint.  Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.  Art is always more abstract than we fancy.  Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all.  It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him.  And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse.  I see now that you were right.  The picture cannot be shown.  You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you.  As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.""  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  The colour came back to his cheeks, and a smile played about his lips.  The peril was over.  He was safe for the time.  Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend.  Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.  But that was all.  He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry?  Was that one of the things that life had in store?  ""It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,"" said Hallward, ""that you should have seen this in the portrait.  Did you really see it?""  ""I saw something in it,"" he answered, ""something that seemed to me very curious.""  ""Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?""  Dorian shook his head.  ""You must not ask me that, Basil.  I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture.""  ""You will some day, surely?""  ""Never.""  ""Well, perhaps you are right.  And now good-bye, Dorian.  You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.  Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you.  Ah! you don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you.""  ""My dear Basil,"" said Dorian, ""what have you told me?  Simply that you felt that you admired me too much.  That is not even a compliment.""  ""It was not intended as a compliment.  It was a confession.  Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.  Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words.""  ""It was a very disappointing confession.""  ""Why, what did you expect, Dorian?  You didn't see anything else in the picture, did you?  There was nothing else to see?""  ""No; there was nothing else to see.  Why do you ask?  But you mustn't talk about worship.  It is foolish.  You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so.""  ""You have got Harry,"" said the painter sadly.  ""Oh, Harry!"" cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.  ""Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable.  Just the sort of life I would like to lead.  But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble.  I would sooner go to you, Basil.""  ""You will sit to me again?""  ""Impossible!""  ""You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.  No man comes across two ideal things.  Few come across one.""  ""I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again. There is something fatal about a portrait.  It has a life of its own. I will come and have tea with you.  That will be just as pleasant.""  ""Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,"" murmured Hallward regretfully.  ""And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again.  But that can't be helped.  I quite understand what you feel about it.""  As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.  Poor Basil!  How little he knew of the true reason!  And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!  How much that strange confession explained to him!  The painter's absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious reticences--he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.  He sighed and touched the bell.  The portrait must be hidden away at all costs.  He could not run such a risk of discovery again.  It had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.      When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.  The man was quite impassive and waited for his orders.  Dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it.  He could see the reflection of Victor's face perfectly.  It was like a placid mask of servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there.  Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.  Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once.  It seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen.  Or was that merely his own fancy?  After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library.  He asked her for the key of the schoolroom.  ""The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?"" she exclaimed.  ""Why, it is full of dust.  I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It is not fit for you to see, sir.  It is not, indeed.""  ""I don't want it put straight, Leaf.  I only want the key.""  ""Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it.  Why, it hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his lordship died.""  He winced at the mention of his grandfather.  He had hateful memories of him.  ""That does not matter,"" he answered.  ""I simply want to see the place--that is all.  Give me the key.""  ""And here is the key, sir,"" said the old lady, going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.  ""Here is the key.  I'll have it off the bunch in a moment.  But you don't think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?""  ""No, no,"" he cried petulantly.  ""Thank you, Leaf.  That will do.""  She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the household.  He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best.  She left the room, wreathed in smiles.  As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room.  His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in.  It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead.  Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas.  They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace.  They would defile it and make it shameful.  And yet the thing would still live on.  It would be always alive.  He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.  Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament.  The love that he bore him--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual.  It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire.  It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.  Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was too late now.  The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that.  But the future was inevitable.  There were passions in him that would fi"|2
23|"nd their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.  He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was the face on the canvas viler than before?  It seemed to him that it was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.  Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there.  It was simply the expression that had altered.  That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little account!  His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement.  A look of pain came across him, and he flung the rich pall over the picture.  As he did so, a knock came to the door.  He passed out as his servant entered.  ""The persons are here, Monsieur.""  He felt that the man must be got rid of at once.  He must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to.  There was something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.  ""Wait for an answer,"" he said, handing it to him, ""and show the men in here.""  In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.  Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him.  As a rule, he never left his shop.  He waited for people to come to him.  But he always made an exception in favour of Dorian Gray.  There was something about Dorian that charmed everybody.  It was a pleasure even to see him.  ""What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?"" he said, rubbing his fat freckled hands.  ""I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person.  I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir.  Picked it up at a sale.  Old Florentine.  Came from Fonthill, I believe.  Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.""  ""I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr. Hubbard.  I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame--though I don't go in much at present for religious art--but to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me.  It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.""  ""No trouble at all, Mr. Gray.  I am delighted to be of any service to you.  Which is the work of art, sir?""  ""This,"" replied Dorian, moving the screen back.  ""Can you move it, covering and all, just as it is?  I don't want it to get scratched going upstairs.""  ""There will be no difficulty, sir,"" said the genial frame-maker, beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended.  ""And, now, where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?""  ""I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or perhaps you had better go in front.  I am afraid it is right at the top of the house.  We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.""  He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent.  The elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.  ""Something of a load to carry, sir,"" gasped the little man when they reached the top landing.  And he wiped his shiny forehead.  ""I am afraid it is rather heavy,"" murmured Dorian as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.  He had not entered the place for more than four years--not, indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then as a study when he grew somewhat older.  It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance.  It appeared to Dorian to have but little changed.  There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy.  There the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks.  On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists.  How well he remembered it all!  Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round.  He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away.  How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him!  But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this.  He had the key, and no one else could enter it.  Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean.  What did it matter?  No one could see it.  He himself would not see it.  Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul?  He kept his youth--that was enough.  And, besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all?  There was no reason that the future should be so full of shame.  Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.  Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.  No; that was impossible.  Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon the canvas was growing old.  It might escape the hideousness of sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.  The cheeks would become hollow or flaccid.  Yellow crow's feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible.  The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are.  There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.  The picture had to be concealed.  There was no help for it.  ""Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,"" he said, wearily, turning round. ""I am sorry I kept you so long.  I was thinking of something else.""  ""Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,"" answered the frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath.  ""Where shall we put it, sir?""  ""Oh, anywhere.  Here:  this will do.  I don't want to have it hung up. Just lean it against the wall.  Thanks.""  ""Might one look at the work of art, sir?""  Dorian started.  ""It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,"" he said, keeping his eye on the man.  He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life.  ""I shan't trouble you any more now. I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.""  ""Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.  Ever ready to do anything for you, sir."" And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face.  He had never seen any one so marvellous.  When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket.  He felt safe now.  No one would ever look upon the horrible thing.  No eye but his would ever see his shame.  On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o'clock and that the tea had been already brought up.  On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled.  A copy of the third edition of _The St. James's Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned.  He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing. He would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a blank space was visible on the wall.  Perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room.  It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house.  He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace.  He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's note.  It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James's_ languidly, and looked through it.  A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye.  It drew attention to the following paragraph:   INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.--An inquest was held this morning at the Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre, Holborn.  A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.   He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and flung the pieces away.  How ugly it all was!  And how horribly real ugliness made things!  He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him the report.  And it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil.  Victor might have read it.  The man knew more than enough English for that.  Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something.  And, yet, what did it matter?  What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?  There was nothing to fear.  Dorian Gray had not killed her.  His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.  What was it, he wondered.  He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves.  After a few minutes he became absorbed.  It was the strangest book that he had ever read.  It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him.  Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him.  Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.  It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin.  The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_. There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour.  The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy.  One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.  It was a poisonous book.  The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.  The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.  Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed through the windows.  He read on by its wan light till he could read no more.  Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner.  It was almost nine o'clock before he reached the club, where he found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.  ""I am so sorry, Harry,"" he cried, ""but really it is entirely your fault.  That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going.""  ""Yes, I thought you would like it,"" replied his host, rising from his chair.  ""I didn't say I liked it, Harry.  I said it fascinated me.  There is a great difference.""  ""Ah, you have discovered that?"" murmured Lord Henry.  And they passed into the dining-room.      For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it.  He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control.  The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself.  And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it.  In one point he was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero.  He never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable.  It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place--that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly valued.  For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him.  Even those who had heard the most evil things against him--and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs--could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him.  He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.  Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.  There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them.  His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.  They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.  Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass.  The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure.  He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.  He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.  He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.  There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish.  But moments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification.  The more he knew, the more he desired to know.  He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.  Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society.  Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.  His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.  Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world.  To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to ""make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.""  Like Gautier, he was one for whom ""the visible world existed.""  And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him.  His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.  For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane.  He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.  The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.  As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.  So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose!  There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.  Yes:  there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.  It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience.  Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.  Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.  But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.  There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.  Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble.  In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.  Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave.  Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.  The wan mirrors get back their mimic life.  The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed.  Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.  We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.  It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.  It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him.  The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize.  He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the ""_panis caelestis_,"" the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.  The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him.  As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.  But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.  Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.  Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself.  He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.  And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East.  He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the i"|2
24|"magination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.  At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed--or feigned to charm--great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.  The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear.  He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them.  He had the mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness.  He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description.  The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.  Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to ""Tannhauser"" and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.  On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls.  This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him.  He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.  He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal.  He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.  He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.  In Alphonso's Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes ""with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs."" There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and ""by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe"" the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain.  According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent.  The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine.  The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour.  The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids. Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.  The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague.  In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any danger by fire.  The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the ceremony of his coronation.  The gates of the palace of John the Priest were ""made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within."" Over the gable were ""two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,"" so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night.  In Lodge's strange romance 'A Margarite of America', it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold ""all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults."" Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead.  A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss.  When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he flung it away--Procopius tells the story--nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it.  The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he worshipped.  When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds.  Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies.  Hall described Henry VIII, on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as wearing ""a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large balasses."" The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane.  Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parseme_ with pearls.  Henry II wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients.  The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.  How exquisite life had once been!  How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration!  Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.  Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe.  As he investigated the subject--and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up--he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.  He, at any rate, had escaped that.  Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged.  No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom.  How different it was with material things!  Where had they passed to?  Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?  Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?  He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with ""lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature""; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning ""_Madame, je suis tout joyeux_,"" the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls.  He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with ""thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold.""  Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.  Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.  Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment.  The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran.  Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.  It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.  And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as ""woven air,"" and ""running water,"" and ""evening dew""; strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of _lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_, with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.  He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church.  In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.  Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals.  The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work.  The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.  In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his imagination.  For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne.  Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.  For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence. Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away.  On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.  After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter.  He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.  He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.  It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that?  He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him.  He had not painted it.  What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?  Even if he told them, would they believe it?  Yet he was afraid.  Sometimes when he was down at his great house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.  What if it should be stolen?  The mere thought made him cold with horror.  Surely the world would know his secret then.  Perhaps the world already suspected it.  For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him. He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.  Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year.  It was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.  His extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to discover his secret.  Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him.  It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.  Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.  Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm.  His great wealth was a certain element of security.  Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating.  It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.  And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life.  Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrees_, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view.  For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.  Form is absolutely essential to it.  It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.  Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.  Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion.  He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.  To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.  He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins.  Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was ""caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company.""  Was it young Herbert's life that he sometimes led?  Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own?  Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life?  Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.  What had this man's legacy been?  Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame?  Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?  Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.  A flower was in her right hand, and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses.  On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.  There were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes.  He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told about her lovers.  Had he something of her temperament in him?  These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him.  What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches?  How evil he looked!  The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.  Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings.  He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.  What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert?  How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!  What passions had he bequeathed?  The world had looked upon him as infamous.  He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.  Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.  Her blood, also, stirred within him.  How curious it all seemed!  And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips--he knew what he had got from her.  He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others.  She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.  There were vine leaves in her hair.  The purple spilled from the cup she was holding.  The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour.  They seemed to follow him wherever he went.  Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.  There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions.  He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety.  It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.  The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy.  In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _taedium vitae_, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.  Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad:  Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, who had so wildly adored his brother's wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.  There was a horrible fascination in them all.  He saw them at night, and they troubled his imagination in the day.  The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain.  Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.  There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.      It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.  He was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold and foggy.  At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up.  He had a bag in his hand.  Dorian recognized him.  It was Basil Hallward.  A strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over him.  He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house.  But Hallward had seen him.  Dorian heard him first stopping on the pavement and then hurrying after him.  In a few moments, his hand was on his arm.  ""Dorian!  What an extraordinary piece of luck!  I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock. Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.  "|2
25|"I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left.  I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me.  But I wasn't quite sure.  Didn't you recognize me?""  ""In this fog, my dear Basil?  Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square.  I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel at all certain about it.  I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages.  But I suppose you will be back soon?""  ""No:  I am going to be out of England for six months.  I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head.  However, it wasn't about myself I wanted to talk.  Here we are at your door.  Let me come in for a moment.  I have something to say to you.""  ""I shall be charmed.  But won't you miss your train?"" said Dorian Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch-key.  The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch.  ""I have heaps of time,"" he answered.  ""The train doesn't go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.  In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you.  You see, I shan't have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things.  All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.""  Dorian looked at him and smiled.  ""What a way for a fashionable painter to travel!  A Gladstone bag and an ulster!  Come in, or the fog will get into the house.  And mind you don't talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious nowadays.  At least nothing should be.""  Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the library.  There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.  The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.  ""You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian.  He gave me everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes.  He is a most hospitable creature.  I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have.  What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?""  Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  ""I believe he married Lady Radley's maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker. Anglomania is very fashionable over there now, I hear.  It seems silly of the French, doesn't it?  But--do you know?--he was not at all a bad servant.  I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about.  One often imagines things that are quite absurd.  He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away.  Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself.  There is sure to be some in the next room.""  ""Thanks, I won't have anything more,"" said the painter, taking his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner.  ""And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously. Don't frown like that.  You make it so much more difficult for me.""  ""What is it all about?"" cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa.  ""I hope it is not about myself.  I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.""  ""It is about yourself,"" answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, ""and I must say it to you.  I shall only keep you half an hour.""  Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette.  ""Half an hour!"" he murmured.  ""It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking.  I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London.""  ""I don't wish to know anything about them.  I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me.  They have not got the charm of novelty.""  ""They must interest you, Dorian.  Every gentleman is interested in his good name.  You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded.  Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing.  But position and wealth are not everything.  Mind you, I don't believe these rumours at all.  At least, I can't believe them when I see you.  Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's face.  It cannot be concealed.  People talk sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things.  If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.  Somebody--I won't mention his name, but you know him--came to me last year to have his portrait done.  I had never seen him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good deal since.  He offered an extravagant price.  I refused him.  There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated.  I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.  His life is dreadful.  But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can't believe anything against you.  And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don't know what to say.  Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?  Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs?  You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.  I met him at dinner last week.  Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley.  Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with.  I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.  He told me.  He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible!  Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?  There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.  You were his great friend.  There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.  You and he were inseparable.  What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end?  What about Lord Kent's only son and his career?  I met his father yesterday in St. James's Street.  He seemed broken with shame and sorrow.  What about the young Duke of Perth?  What sort of life has he got now?  What gentleman would associate with him?""  ""Stop, Basil.  You are talking about things of which you know nothing,"" said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt in his voice.  ""You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows anything about mine.  With such blood as he has in his veins, how could his record be clean?  You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery?  If Kent's silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me?  If Adrian Singleton writes his friend's name across a bill, am I his keeper?  I know how people chatter in England.  The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander.  In this country, it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him. And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves?  My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.""  ""Dorian,"" cried Hallward, ""that is not the question.  England is bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong.  That is the reason why I want you to be fine.  You have not been fine.  One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.  Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity.  You have filled them with a madness for pleasure.  They have gone down into the depths.  You led them there.  Yes:  you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now.  And there is worse behind.  I know you and Harry are inseparable.  Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not have made his sister's name a by-word.""  ""Take care, Basil.  You go too far.""  ""I must speak, and you must listen.  You shall listen.  When you met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her.  Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?  Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her.  Then there are other stories--stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London.  Are they true?  Can they be true?  When I first heard them, I laughed.  I hear them now, and they make me shudder.  What about your country-house and the life that is led there?  Dorian, you don't know what is said about you.  I won't tell you that I don't want to preach to you.  I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then proceeded to break his word.  I do want to preach to you.  I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you.  I want you to have a clean name and a fair record.  I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with.  Don't shrug your shoulders like that.  Don't be so indifferent.  You have a wonderful influence.  Let it be for good, not for evil.  They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after.  I don't know whether it is so or not.  How should I know?  But it is said of you.  I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford.  He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.  Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read.  I told him that it was absurd--that I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.  Know you?  I wonder do I know you?  Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.""  ""To see my soul!"" muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear.  ""Yes,"" answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his voice, ""to see your soul.  But only God can do that.""  A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man.  ""You shall see it yourself, to-night!"" he cried, seizing a lamp from the table.  ""Come:  it is your own handiwork.  Why shouldn't you look at it?  You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you.  If they did believe you, they would like me all the better for it.  I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously.  Come, I tell you.  You have chattered enough about corruption.  Now you shall look on it face to face.""  There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered.  He stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner.  He felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done.  ""Yes,"" he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into his stern eyes, ""I shall show you my soul.  You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see.""  Hallward started back.  ""This is blasphemy, Dorian!"" he cried.  ""You must not say things like that.  They are horrible, and they don't mean anything.""  ""You think so?""  He laughed again.  ""I know so.  As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good.  You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.""  ""Don't touch me.  Finish what you have to say.""  A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face.  He paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.  After all, what right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray?  If he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.  ""I am waiting, Basil,"" said the young man in a hard clear voice.  He turned round.  ""What I have to say is this,"" he cried.  ""You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you.  If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I shall believe you.  Deny them, Dorian, deny them!  Can't you see what I am going through?  My God! don't tell me that you are bad, and corrupt, and shameful.""  Dorian Gray smiled.  There was a curl of contempt in his lips.  ""Come upstairs, Basil,"" he said quietly.  ""I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.  I shall show it to you if you come with me.""  ""I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.  I see I have missed my train.  That makes no matter.  I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.""  ""That shall be given to you upstairs.  I could not give it here.  You will not have to read long.""      He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close behind.  They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night.  The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase.  A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.  When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock.  ""You insist on knowing, Basil?"" he asked in a low voice.  ""Yes.""  ""I am delighted,"" he answered, smiling.  Then he added, somewhat harshly, ""You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me.  You have had more to do with my life than you think""; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.  A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange.  He shuddered.  ""Shut the door behind you,"" he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.  Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression.  The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years.  A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty book-case--that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table.  As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes.  A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting.  There was a damp odour of mildew.  ""So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?  Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine.""  The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.  ""You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part,"" muttered Hallward, frowning.  ""You won't? Then I must do it myself,"" said the young man, and he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.  An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him.  There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty.  There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth.  The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself.  But who had done it?  He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design.  The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.  He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture.  In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.  It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire.  He had never done that.  Still, it was his own picture.  He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice.  His own picture!  What did it mean?  Why had it altered?  He turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.  His mouth twitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.  He passed his hand across his forehead.  It was dank with clammy sweat.  The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting.  There was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy.  There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes.  He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.  ""What does this mean?"" cried Hallward, at last.  His own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears.  ""Years ago, when I was a boy,"" said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, ""you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks.  One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty.  In a mad moment that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer....""  ""I remember it!  Oh, how well I remember it!  No! the thing is impossible.  The room is damp.  Mildew has got into the canvas.  The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.  I tell you the thing is impossible.""  ""Ah, what is impossible?"" murmured the young man, going over to the window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.  ""You told me you had destroyed it.""  ""I was wrong.  It has destroyed me.""  ""I don't believe it is my picture.""  ""Can't you see your ideal in it?"" said Dorian bitterly.  ""My ideal, as you call it...""  ""As you called it.""  ""There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.  You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again.  This is the face of a satyr.""  ""It is the face of my soul.""  ""Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped!  It has the eyes of a devil.""  ""Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,"" cried Dorian with a wild gesture of despair.  Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it.  ""My God!  If it is true,"" he exclaimed, ""and this is what you have done with your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be!"" He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it.  The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it.  It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away.  The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.  His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering.  He placed his foot on it and put it out.  Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands.  ""Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!  What an awful lesson!"" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.  ""Pray, Dorian, pray,"" he murmured.  ""What is it that one was taught to say in one's boyhood?  'Lead us not into temptation.  Forgive us our sins. Wash away our iniquities.'  Let us say that together.  The prayer of your pride has been answered.  The prayer of your repentance will be answered also.  I worshipped you too much.  I am punished for it.  You worshipped yourself too much.  We are both punished.""  Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes.  ""It is too late, Basil,"" he faltered.  ""It is never too late, Dorian.  Let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer.  Isn't there a verse somewhere, 'Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?""  ""Those words mean nothing to me now.""  ""Hush!  Don't say that.  You have done enough evil in your life.  My God!  Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?""  Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his ear by those grinning lips.  The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything.  He glanced wildly around.  Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him.  His eye fell on it.  He knew what it was.  It was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him.  He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.  As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and turned round.  Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.  He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and stabbing again and again.  There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood.  Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively, waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air.  He stabbed him twice more, but the man did not move.  Something began to trickle on the floor.  He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.  Then he threw the knife on the table, and listened.  He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.  He opened the door and went out on the landing.  The house was absolutely quiet.  No one was about.  For a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness. Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in as he did so.  The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.  Had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.  How quickly it had all been done!  He felt strangely calm, and walking over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony.  The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.  He looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses.  The crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished.  A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went.  Now and then she stopped and peered back.  Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice.  The policeman strolled over and said something to her.  She stumbled away, laughing.  A bitter blast swept across the square.  The gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro.  He shivered and went back, closing the window behind him.  Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it.  He did not even glance at the murdered man.  He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation.  The friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his life.  That was enough.  Then he remembered the lamp.  It was a rather curious one of Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.  Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and questions would be asked.  He hesitated for a moment, then he turned back and took it from the table.  He could not help seeing the dead thing.  How still it was!  How horribly white the long hands looked!  It was like a dreadful wax image.  Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.  The woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain.  He stopped several times and waited.  No:  everything was still.  It was merely the sound of his own footsteps.  When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner. They must be hidden away somewhere.  He unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises, and put them into it.  He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he pulled out his watch.  It was twenty minutes to two.  He sat down and began to think.  Every year--every month, almost--men were strangled in England for what he had done.  There had been a madness of murder in the air.  Some red star had come too close to the earth.... And yet, what evidence was there against him?  Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.  No one had seen him come in again.  Most of the servants were at Selby Royal.  His valet had gone to bed.... Paris!  Yes.  It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he had intended.  With his curious reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be roused.  Months!  Everything could be destroyed long before then.  A sudden thought struck him.  He put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the hall.  There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull's-eye reflected in the window.  He waited and held his breath.  After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting the door very gently behind him.  Then he began ringing the bell.  In about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy.  ""I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,"" he said, stepping in; ""but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?""  ""Ten minutes past two, sir,"" answered the man, looking at the clock and blinking.  ""Ten minutes past two?  How horribly late!  You must wake me at nine to-morrow. I have some work to do.""  ""All right, sir.""  ""Did any one call this evening?""  ""Mr. Hallward, sir.  He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to catch his train.""  ""Oh!  I am sorry I didn't see him.  Did he leave any message?""  ""No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not find you at the club.""  ""That will do, Francis.  Don't forget to call me at nine to-morrow.""  ""No, sir.""  The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.  Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library.  For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room, biting his lip and thinking.  Then he took down the Blue Book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.  ""Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair.""  Yes; that was the man he wanted.      At nine o'clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.  Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.  He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.  The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been lost in some delightful dream.  Yet he had not dreamed at all. His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason.  It is one of its chiefest charms.  He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate.  The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.  The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.  It was almost like a morning in May.  Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness.  He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion.  The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlig"|2
26|"ht now.  How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.  He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad.  There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.  But this was not one of them.  It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.  When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once.  He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.  At some of the letters, he smiled.  Three of them bored him.  One he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.  ""That awful thing, a woman's memory!"" as Lord Henry had once said.  After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters.  One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.  ""Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address.""  As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.  Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward.  He frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.  When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the book.  It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.  The binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates.  It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.  As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand ""_du supplice encore mal lavee_,"" with its downy red hairs and its ""_doigts de faune_.""  He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:       Sur une gamme chromatique,        Le sein de peries ruisselant,      La Venus de l'Adriatique        Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.       Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes        Suivant la phrase au pur contour,      S'enflent comme des gorges rondes        Que souleve un soupir d'amour.       L'esquif aborde et me depose,        Jetant son amarre au pilier,      Devant une facade rose,        Sur le marbre d'un escalier.   How exquisite they were!  As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.  The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.  The sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades.  Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:       ""Devant une facade rose,         Sur le marbre d'un escalier.""  The whole of Venice was in those two lines.  He remembered the autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies.  There was romance in every place.  But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.  Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.  Poor Basil!  What a horrible way for a man to die!  He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.  He read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _cafe_ at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the ""_monstre charmant_"" that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.  But after a time the book fell from his hand.  He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him.  What if Alan Campbell should be out of England?  Days would elapse before he could come back.  Perhaps he might refuse to come.  What could he do then?  Every moment was of vital importance.  They had been great friends once, five years before--almost inseparable, indeed.  Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled:  Alan Campbell never did.  He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.  His dominant intellectual passion was for science.  At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.  Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions.  He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.  In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished--and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it.  They had met at Lady Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.  For eighteen months their intimacy lasted.  Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.  To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.  Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew.  But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present.  He had changed, too--was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.  And this was certainly true.  Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments.  This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.  Every second he kept glancing at the clock.  As the minutes went by he became horribly agitated.  At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing.  He took long stealthy strides. His hands were curiously cold.  The suspense became unbearable.  Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.  He knew what was waiting for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.  It was useless.  The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks.  Then, suddenly, time stopped for him.  Yes:  that blind, slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him.  He stared at it.  Its very horror made him stone.  At last the door opened and his servant entered.  He turned glazed eyes upon him.  ""Mr. Campbell, sir,"" said the man.  A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his cheeks.  ""Ask him to come in at once, Francis.""  He felt that he was himself again.  His mood of cowardice had passed away.  The man bowed and retired.  In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.  ""Alan!  This is kind of you.  I thank you for coming.""  ""I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.  But you said it was a matter of life and death.""  His voice was hard and cold.  He spoke with slow deliberation.  There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.  He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.  ""Yes:  it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.  Sit down.""  Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The two men's eyes met.  In Dorian's there was infinite pity.  He knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.  After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for, ""Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table. He has been dead ten hours now.  Don't stir, and don't look at me like that.  Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you.  What you have to do is this--""  ""Stop, Gray.  I don't want to know anything further.  Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me.  I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life.  Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.  They don't interest me any more.""  ""Alan, they will have to interest you.  This one will have to interest you.  I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.  But I can't help myself.  You are the one man who is able to save me.  I am forced to bring you into the matter.  I have no option.  Alan, you are scientific.  You know about chemistry and things of that kind.  You have made experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs--to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.  Nobody saw this person come into the house.  Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris.  He will not be missed for months.  When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here.  You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air.""  ""You are mad, Dorian.""  ""Ah!  I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.""  ""You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.  I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.  Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you?  What is it to me what devil's work you are up to?""  ""It was suicide, Alan.""  ""I am glad of that.  But who drove him to it?  You, I should fancy.""  ""Do you still refuse to do this for me?""  ""Of course I refuse.  I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.  I don't care what shame comes on you.  You deserve it all.  I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.  How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?  I should have thought you knew more about people's characters.  Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you.  Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man.  Go to some of your friends.  Don't come to me.""  ""Alan, it was murder.  I killed him.  You don't know what he had made me suffer.  Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had.  He may not have intended it, the result was the same.""  ""Murder!  Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?  I shall not inform upon you.  It is not my business.  Besides, without my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested.  Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid.  But I will have nothing to do with it.""  ""You must have something to do with it.  Wait, wait a moment; listen to me.  Only listen, Alan.  All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.  You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don't affect you.  If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject.  You would not turn a hair.  You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong.  On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at.  And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.  If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.""  ""I have no desire to help you.  You forget that.  I am simply indifferent to the whole thing.  It has nothing to do with me.""  ""Alan, I entreat you.  Think of the position I am in.  Just before you came I almost fainted with terror.  You may know terror yourself some day.  No! don't think of that.  Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view.  You don't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from.  Don't inquire now.  I have told you too much as it is.  But I beg of you to do this.  We were friends once, Alan.""  ""Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead.""  ""The dead linger sometimes.  The man upstairs will not go away.  He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.  Alan! Alan!  If you don't come to my assistance, I am ruined.  Why, they will hang me, Alan!  Don't you understand?  They will hang me for what I have done.""  ""There is no good in prolonging this scene.  I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter.  It is insane of you to ask me.""  ""You refuse?""  ""Yes.""  ""I entreat you, Alan.""  ""It is useless.""  The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes.  Then he stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.  He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.  Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.  Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it.  As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair.  A horrible sense of sickness came over him.  He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.  After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.  ""I am so sorry for you, Alan,"" he murmured, ""but you leave me no alternative.  I have a letter written already.  Here it is.  You see the address.  If you don't help me, I must send it.  If you don't help me, I will send it.  You know what the result will be.  But you are going to help me.  It is impossible for you to refuse now.  I tried to spare you.  You will do me the justice to admit that.  You were stern, harsh, offensive.  You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me--no living man, at any rate.  I bore it all.  Now it is for me to dictate terms.""  Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.  ""Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.  You know what they are. The thing is quite simple.  Come, don't work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done.  Face it, and do it.""  A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he shivered all over.  The ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne.  He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him.  The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable.  It seemed to crush him.  ""Come, Alan, you must decide at once.""  ""I cannot do it,"" he said, mechanically, as though words could alter things.  ""You must.  You have no choice.  Don't delay.""  He hesitated a moment.  ""Is there a fire in the room upstairs?""  ""Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.""  ""I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.""  ""No, Alan, you must not leave the house.  Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you.""  Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his assistant.  Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.  Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him.  As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a kind of ague.  For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.  A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.  As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.  There was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him. ""You are infamous, absolutely infamous!"" he muttered.  ""Hush, Alan.  You have saved my life,"" said Dorian.  ""Your life?  Good heavens! what a life that is!  You have gone from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.  In doing what I am going to do--what you force me to do--it is not of your life that I am thinking.""  ""Ah, Alan,"" murmured Dorian with a sigh, ""I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you."" He turned away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden.  Campbell made no answer.  After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.  ""Shall I leave the things here, sir?"" he asked Campbell.  ""Yes,"" said Dorian.  ""And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another errand for you.  What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids?""  ""Harden, sir.""  ""Yes--Harden.  You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible.  In fact, I don't want any white ones.  It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty place--otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it.""  ""No trouble, sir.  At what time shall I be back?""  Dorian looked at Campbell.  ""How long will your experiment take, Alan?"" he said in a calm indifferent voice.  The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.  Campbell frowned and bit his lip.  ""It will take about five hours,"" he answered.  ""It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, Francis.  Or stay:  just leave my things out for dressing.  You can have the evening to yourself.  I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you.""  ""Thank you, sir,"" said the man, leaving the room.  ""Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.  How heavy this chest is! I'll take it for you.  You bring the other things.""  He spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner.  Campbell felt dominated by him.  They left the room together.  When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.  Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his eyes.  He shuddered.  ""I don't think I can go in, Alan,"" he murmured.  ""It is nothing to me.  I don't require you,"" said Campbell coldly.  Dorian half opened the door.  As he did so, he saw the face of his portrait leering in the sunlight.  On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying.  He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.  What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?  How horrible it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.  He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man.  Then, stooping down and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the picture.  There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.  He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.  He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had thought of each other.  ""Leave me now,"" said a stern voice behind him.  He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.  As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being turned in the lock.  It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library.  He was pale, but absolutely calm.  ""I have done what you asked me to do,"" he muttered. ""And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.""  ""You have saved me from ruin, Alan.  I cannot forget that,"" said Dorian simply.  As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs.  There was a horrible smell of nitric acid in the room.  But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.      That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants.  His forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his manner as he bent over his hostess's hand was as easy and graceful as ever.  Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to play a part.  Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age.  Those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God and goodness.  He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life.  It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness.  She had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and French _esprit_ when she could get it.  Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life.  ""I know, my dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,"" she used to say, ""and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.  It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.  As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody. However, that was all Narborough's fault.  He was dreadfully short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything.""  Her guests this evening were rather tedious.  The fact was, as she explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.  ""I think it is most unkind of her, my dear,"" she whispered.  ""Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up.  You don't know what an existence they lead down there.  It is pure unadulterated country life.  They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to think about.  There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner.  You shan't sit next either of them.  You shall sit by me and amuse me.""  Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room.  Yes: it was certainly a tedious party.  Two of the people he had never seen before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess's daughter, a dowdy dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.  He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed:  ""How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late!  I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me.""  It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.  But at dinner he could not eat anything.  Plate after plate went away untasted.  Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called ""an insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,"" and now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence and abstracted manner.  From time to time the butler filled his glass with champagne.  He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.  ""Dorian,"" said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being handed round, ""what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out of sorts.""  ""I believe he is in love,"" cried Lady Narborough, ""and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous.  He is quite right.  I certainl"|2
27|"y should.""  ""Dear Lady Narborough,"" murmured Dorian, smiling, ""I have not been in love for a whole week--not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.""  ""How you men can fall in love with that woman!"" exclaimed the old lady. ""I really cannot understand it.""  ""It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady Narborough,"" said Lord Henry.  ""She is the one link between us and your short frocks.""  ""She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry.  But I remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _decolletee_ she was then.""  ""She is still _decolletee_,"" he answered, taking an olive in his long fingers; ""and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an _edition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.  She is really wonderful, and full of surprises.  Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.""  ""How can you, Harry!"" cried Dorian.  ""It is a most romantic explanation,"" laughed the hostess.  ""But her third husband, Lord Henry!  You don't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?""  ""Certainly, Lady Narborough.""  ""I don't believe a word of it.""  ""Well, ask Mr. Gray.  He is one of her most intimate friends.""  ""Is it true, Mr. Gray?""  ""She assures me so, Lady Narborough,"" said Dorian.  ""I asked her whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle.  She told me she didn't, because none of them had had any hearts at all.""  ""Four husbands!  Upon my word that is _trop de zele_.""  ""_Trop d'audace_, I tell her,"" said Dorian.  ""Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear.  And what is Ferrol like?  I don't know him.""  ""The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,"" said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.  Lady Narborough hit him with her fan.  ""Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.""  ""But what world says that?"" asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows. ""It can only be the next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.""  ""Everybody I know says you are very wicked,"" cried the old lady, shaking her head.  Lord Henry looked serious for some moments.  ""It is perfectly monstrous,"" he said, at last, ""the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.""  ""Isn't he incorrigible?"" cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.  ""I hope so,"" said his hostess, laughing.  ""But really, if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion.""  ""You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,"" broke in Lord Henry. ""You were far too happy.  When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband.  When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife.  Women try their luck; men risk theirs.""  ""Narborough wasn't perfect,"" cried the old lady.  ""If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,"" was the rejoinder.  ""Women love us for our defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.  You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite true.""  ""Of course it is true, Lord Henry.  If we women did not love you for your defects, where would you all be?  Not one of you would ever be married.  You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors.  Not, however, that that would alter you much.  Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.""  ""_Fin de siecle_,"" murmured Lord Henry.  ""_Fin du globe_,"" answered his hostess.  ""I wish it were _fin du globe_,"" said Dorian with a sigh.  ""Life is a great disappointment.""  ""Ah, my dear,"" cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, ""don't tell me that you have exhausted life.  When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him.  Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good--you look so good.  I must find you a nice wife.  Lord Henry, don't you think that Mr. Gray should get married?""  ""I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,"" said Lord Henry with a bow.  ""Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him.  I shall go through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies.""  ""With their ages, Lady Narborough?"" asked Dorian.  ""Of course, with their ages, slightly edited.  But nothing must be done in a hurry.  I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable alliance, and I want you both to be happy.""  ""What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!"" exclaimed Lord Henry.  ""A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.""  ""Ah! what a cynic you are!"" cried the old lady, pushing back her chair and nodding to Lady Ruxton.  ""You must come and dine with me soon again.  You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me.  You must tell me what people you would like to meet, though.  I want it to be a delightful gathering.""  ""I like men who have a future and women who have a past,"" he answered. ""Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?""  ""I fear so,"" she said, laughing, as she stood up.  ""A thousand pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton,"" she added, ""I didn't see you hadn't finished your cigarette.""  ""Never mind, Lady Narborough.  I smoke a great deal too much.  I am going to limit myself, for the future.""  ""Pray don't, Lady Ruxton,"" said Lord Henry.  ""Moderation is a fatal thing.  Enough is as bad as a meal.  More than enough is as good as a feast.""  Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously.  ""You must come and explain that to me some afternoon, Lord Henry.  It sounds a fascinating theory,"" she murmured, as she swept out of the room.  ""Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and scandal,"" cried Lady Narborough from the door.  ""If you do, we are sure to squabble upstairs.""  The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and came up to the top.  Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and sat by Lord Henry.  Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the House of Commons.  He guffawed at his adversaries. The word _doctrinaire_--word full of terror to the British mind--reappeared from time to time between his explosions.  An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory.  He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought.  The inherited stupidity of the race--sound English common sense he jovially termed it--was shown to be the proper bulwark for society.  A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he turned round and looked at Dorian.  ""Are you better, my dear fellow?"" he asked.  ""You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner.""  ""I am quite well, Harry.  I am tired.  That is all.""  ""You were charming last night.  The little duchess is quite devoted to you.  She tells me she is going down to Selby.""  ""She has promised to come on the twentieth.""  ""Is Monmouth to be there, too?""  ""Oh, yes, Harry.""  ""He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her.  She is very clever, too clever for a woman.  She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.  It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious.  Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay. White porcelain feet, if you like.  They have been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens.  She has had experiences.""  ""How long has she been married?"" asked Dorian.  ""An eternity, she tells me.  I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in.  Who else is coming?""  ""Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set.  I have asked Lord Grotrian.""  ""I like him,"" said Lord Henry.  ""A great many people don't, but I find him charming.  He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.""  ""I don't know if he will be able to come, Harry.  He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.""  ""Ah! what a nuisance people's people are!  Try and make him come.  By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night.  You left before eleven.  What did you do afterwards?  Did you go straight home?""  Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.  ""No, Harry,"" he said at last, ""I did not get home till nearly three.""  ""Did you go to the club?""  ""Yes,"" he answered.  Then he bit his lip.  ""No, I don't mean that.  I didn't go to the club.  I walked about.  I forget what I did.... How inquisitive you are, Harry!  You always want to know what one has been doing.  I always want to forget what I have been doing.  I came in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time.  I had left my latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in.  If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.""  Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.  ""My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman. Something has happened to you, Dorian.  Tell me what it is.  You are not yourself to-night.""  ""Don't mind me, Harry.  I am irritable, and out of temper.  I shall come round and see you to-morrow, or next day.  Make my excuses to Lady Narborough.  I shan't go upstairs.  I shall go home.  I must go home.""  ""All right, Dorian.  I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time. The duchess is coming.""  ""I will try to be there, Harry,"" he said, leaving the room.  As he drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him.  Lord Henry's casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted his nerve still.  Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.  He winced.  He hated the idea of even touching them.  Yet it had to be done.  He realized that, and when he had locked the door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag.  A huge fire was blazing.  He piled another log on it.  The smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible.  It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume everything.  At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.  Suddenly he started.  His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed nervously at his underlip.  Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis.  He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed.  His breath quickened.  A mad craving came over him. He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.  His eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.  But he still watched the cabinet.  At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring.  A triangular drawer passed slowly out.  His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.  It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.  He opened it. Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent.  He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his face.  Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock.  It was twenty minutes to twelve.  He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did so, and went into his bedroom.  As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept quietly out of his house.  In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good horse.  He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.  The man shook his head.  ""It is too far for me,"" he muttered.  ""Here is a sovereign for you,"" said Dorian.  ""You shall have another if you drive fast.""  ""All right, sir,"" answered the man, ""you will be there in an hour,"" and after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly towards the river.      A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist.  The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.  From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.  In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.  Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, ""To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.""  Yes, that was the secret.  He had often tried it, and would try it again now.  There were opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.  The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.  From time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.  The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.  Once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.  A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles.  The sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.  ""To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!""  How the words rang in his ears!  His soul, certainly, was sick to death.  Was it true that the senses could cure it?  Innocent blood had been spilled.  What could atone for that?  Ah! for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?  Who had made him a judge over others?  He had said things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.  On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step.  He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.  His throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.  He struck at the horse madly with his stick.  The driver laughed and whipped up.  He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.  The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider.  The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.  Then they passed by lonely brickfields.  The fog was lighter here, and he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire.  A dog barked as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed.  The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.  After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven streets.  Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.  He watched them curiously.  They moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things.  He hated them.  A dull rage was in his heart.  As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards.  The driver beat at them with his whip.  It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.  Certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still have dominated his temper.  From cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that very reason.  Ugliness was the one reality.  The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.  They were what he needed for forgetfulness.  In three days he would be free.  Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.  Over the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships.  Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.  ""Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it?"" he asked huskily through the trap.  Dorian started and peered round.  ""This will do,"" he answered, and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.  Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.  The light shook and splintered in the puddles.  A red glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was coaling.  The slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.  He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed.  In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.  In one of the top-windows stood a lamp.  He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.  After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked.  The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed.  At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street.  He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls.  Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.  The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.  Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered.  In one corner, with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust.  ""He thinks he's got red ants on him,"" laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by.  The man looked at her in terror and began to whimper.  At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber.  As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him.  He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure.  When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.  ""You here, Adrian?"" muttered Dorian.  ""Where else should I be?"" he answered, listlessly.  ""None of the chaps will speak to me now.""  ""I thought you had left England.""  ""Darlington is not going to do anything.  My brother paid the bill at last.  George doesn't speak to me either.... I don't care,"" he added with a sigh.  ""As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends. I think I have had too many friends.""  Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses.  The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.  He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy.  They were better off than he was.  He was prisoned in thought.  Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away.  From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him.  Yet he felt he could not stay.  The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him.  He wanted to be where no one would know who he was.  He wanted to escape from himself.  ""I am going on to the other place,"" he said after a pause.  ""On the wharf?""  ""Yes.""  ""That mad-cat is sure to be there.  They won't have her in this place now.""  Dorian shrugged his shoulders.  ""I am sick of women who love one. Women who hate one are much more interesting.  Besides, the stuff is better.""  ""Much the same.""  ""I like it better.  Come and have something to drink.  I must have something.""  ""I don't want anything,"" murmured the young man.  ""Never mind.""  Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.  A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them.  The women sidled up and began to chatter.  Dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.  A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the women.  ""We are very proud to-night,"" she sneered.  ""For God's sake don't talk to me,"" cried Dorian, stamping his foot on the ground.  ""What do you want?  Money?  Here it is.  Don't ever talk to me again.""  Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then flickered out and left them dull and glazed.  She tossed her head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers.  Her companion watched her enviously.  ""It's no use,"" sighed Adrian Singleton.  ""I don't care to go back. What does it matter?  I am quite happy here.""  ""You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?"" said Dorian, after a pause.  ""Perhaps.""  ""Good night, then.""  ""Good night,"" answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.  Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.  As he drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had taken his money.  ""There goes the devil's bargain!"" she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.  ""Curse you!"" he answered, ""don't call me that.""  She snapped her fingers.  ""Prince Charming is what you like to be called, ain't it?"" she yelled after him.  The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly round.  The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear.  He rushed out as if in pursuit.  Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.  His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult.  He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.  Yet, after all, what did it matter to him?  One's days were too brief to take the burden of another's errors on one's shoulders.  Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.  The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault.  One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.  There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses.  Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.  They move to their terrible end as automatons move.  Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.  For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.  When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.  Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his throat.  He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away.  In a second he heard the click of a revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.  ""What do you want?"" he gasped.  ""Keep quiet,"" said the man.  ""If you stir, I shoot you.""  ""You are mad.  What have I done to you?""  ""You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,"" was the answer, ""and Sibyl Vane was my sister.  She killed herself.  I know it.  Her death is at your door.  I swore I would kill you in return.  For years I have sought you.  I had no clue, no trace.  The two people who could have described you were dead.  I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.  I heard it to-night by chance.  Make your peace with God, for to-night you are going to die.""  Dorian Gray grew sick with fear.  ""I never knew her,"" he stammered.  ""I never heard of her.  You are mad.""  ""You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are going to die.""  There was a horrible moment.  Dorian did not know what to say or do.  ""Down on your knees!"" growled the man.  ""I give you one minute to make your peace--no more.  I go on board to-night for India, and I must do my job first.  One minute.  That's all.""  Dorian's arms fell to his side.  Paralysed with terror, he did not know what to do.  Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.  ""Stop,"" he cried.  ""How long ago is it since your sister died?  Quick, tell me!""  ""Eighteen years,"" said the man.  ""Why do you ask me?  What do years matter?""  ""Eighteen years,"" laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his voice.  ""Eighteen years!  Set me under the lamp and look at my face!""  James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant. Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.  Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth.  He seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago.  It was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life.  He loosened his hold and reeled back.  ""My God! my God!"" he cried, ""and I would have murdered you!""  Dorian Gray drew a long breath.  ""You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime, my man,"" he said, looking at him sternly. ""Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands.""  ""Forgive me, sir,"" muttered James Vane.  ""I was deceived.  A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.""  ""You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble,"" said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the street.  James Vane stood on the pavement in horror.  He was trembling from head to foot.  After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps.  He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start.  It was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar.  ""Why didn't you kill him?"" she hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his.  ""I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly's. You fool!  You should have killed him.  He has lots of money, and he's as bad as bad.""  ""He is not the man I am looking for,"" he answered, ""and I want no man's money.  I want a man's life.  The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now.  This one is little more than a boy.  Thank God, I have not got his blood upon my hands.""  The woman gave a bitter laugh.  ""Little more than a "|2
28|"boy!"" she sneered. ""Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.""  ""You lie!"" cried James Vane.  She raised her hand up to heaven.  ""Before God I am telling the truth,"" she cried.  ""Before God?""  ""Strike me dumb if it ain't so.  He is the worst one that comes here. They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.  It's nigh on eighteen years since I met him.  He hasn't changed much since then. I have, though,"" she added, with a sickly leer.  ""You swear this?""  ""I swear it,"" came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth.  ""But don't give me away to him,"" she whined; ""I am afraid of him.  Let me have some money for my night's lodging.""  He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.  When he looked back, the woman had vanished also.      A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband, a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests.  It was tea-time, and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding.  Her white hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her.  Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them.  On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke's description of the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection.  Three young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.  The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more expected to arrive on the next day.  ""What are you two talking about?"" said Lord Henry, strolling over to the table and putting his cup down.  ""I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys.  It is a delightful idea.""  ""But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry,"" rejoined the duchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes.  ""I am quite satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.""  ""My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world.  They are both perfect.  I was thinking chiefly of flowers.  Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins.  In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called.  He told me it was a fine specimen of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind.  It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.  Names are everything.  I never quarrel with actions.  My one quarrel is with words.  That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature.  The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.  It is the only thing he is fit for.""  ""Then what should we call you, Harry?"" she asked.  ""His name is Prince Paradox,"" said Dorian.  ""I recognize him in a flash,"" exclaimed the duchess.  ""I won't hear of it,"" laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair.  ""From a label there is no escape!  I refuse the title.""  ""Royalties may not abdicate,"" fell as a warning from pretty lips.  ""You wish me to defend my throne, then?""  ""Yes.""  ""I give the truths of to-morrow.""  ""I prefer the mistakes of to-day,"" she answered.  ""You disarm me, Gladys,"" he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.  ""Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.""  ""I never tilt against beauty,"" he said, with a wave of his hand.  ""That is your error, Harry, believe me.  You value beauty far too much.""  ""How can you say that?  I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.  But on the other hand, no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.""  ""Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?"" cried the duchess. ""What becomes of your simile about the orchid?""  ""Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys.  You, as a good Tory, must not underrate them.  Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she is.""  ""You don't like your country, then?"" she asked.  ""I live in it.""  ""That you may censure it the better.""  ""Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?"" he inquired.  ""What do they say of us?""  ""That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.""  ""Is that yours, Harry?""  ""I give it to you.""  ""I could not use it.  It is too true.""  ""You need not be afraid.  Our countrymen never recognize a description.""  ""They are practical.""  ""They are more cunning than practical.  When they make up their ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.""  ""Still, we have done great things.""  ""Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.""  ""We have carried their burden.""  ""Only as far as the Stock Exchange.""  She shook her head.  ""I believe in the race,"" she cried.  ""It represents the survival of the pushing.""  ""It has development.""  ""Decay fascinates me more.""  ""What of art?"" she asked.  ""It is a malady.""  ""Love?""  ""An illusion.""  ""Religion?""  ""The fashionable substitute for belief.""  ""You are a sceptic.""  ""Never!  Scepticism is the beginning of faith.""  ""What are you?""  ""To define is to limit.""  ""Give me a clue.""  ""Threads snap.  You would lose your way in the labyrinth.""  ""You bewilder me.  Let us talk of some one else.""  ""Our host is a delightful topic.  Years ago he was christened Prince Charming.""  ""Ah! don't remind me of that,"" cried Dorian Gray.  ""Our host is rather horrid this evening,"" answered the duchess, colouring.  ""I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly.""  ""Well, I hope he won't stick pins into you, Duchess,"" laughed Dorian.  ""Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.""  ""And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?""  ""For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you.  Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half-past eight.""  ""How unreasonable of her!  You should give her warning.""  ""I daren't, Mr. Gray.  Why, she invents hats for me.  You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone's garden-party?  You don't, but it is nice of you to pretend that you do.  Well, she made it out of nothing.  All good hats are made out of nothing.""  ""Like all good reputations, Gladys,"" interrupted Lord Henry.  ""Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy.  To be popular one must be a mediocrity.""  ""Not with women,"" said the duchess, shaking her head; ""and women rule the world.  I assure you we can't bear mediocrities.  We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.""  ""It seems to me that we never do anything else,"" murmured Dorian.  ""Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,"" answered the duchess with mock sadness.  ""My dear Gladys!"" cried Lord Henry.  ""How can you say that?  Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion.  It merely intensifies it.  We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.""  ""Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?"" asked the duchess after a pause.  ""Especially when one has been wounded by it,"" answered Lord Henry.  The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression in her eyes.  ""What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?"" she inquired.  Dorian hesitated for a moment.  Then he threw his head back and laughed.  ""I always agree with Harry, Duchess.""  ""Even when he is wrong?""  ""Harry is never wrong, Duchess.""  ""And does his philosophy make you happy?""  ""I have never searched for happiness.  Who wants happiness?  I have searched for pleasure.""  ""And found it, Mr. Gray?""  ""Often.  Too often.""  The duchess sighed.  ""I am searching for peace,"" she said, ""and if I don't go and dress, I shall have none this evening.""  ""Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,"" cried Dorian, starting to his feet and walking down the conservatory.  ""You are flirting disgracefully with him,"" said Lord Henry to his cousin.  ""You had better take care.  He is very fascinating.""  ""If he were not, there would be no battle.""  ""Greek meets Greek, then?""  ""I am on the side of the Trojans.  They fought for a woman.""  ""They were defeated.""  ""There are worse things than capture,"" she answered.  ""You gallop with a loose rein.""  ""Pace gives life,"" was the _riposte_.  ""I shall write it in my diary to-night.""  ""What?""  ""That a burnt child loves the fire.""  ""I am not even singed.  My wings are untouched.""  ""You use them for everything, except flight.""  ""Courage has passed from men to women.  It is a new experience for us.""  ""You have a rival.""  ""Who?""  He laughed.  ""Lady Narborough,"" he whispered.  ""She perfectly adores him.""  ""You fill me with apprehension.  The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists.""  ""Romanticists!  You have all the methods of science.""  ""Men have educated us.""  ""But not explained you.""  ""Describe us as a sex,"" was her challenge.  ""Sphinxes without secrets.""  She looked at him, smiling.  ""How long Mr. Gray is!"" she said.  ""Let us go and help him.  I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.""  ""Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.""  ""That would be a premature surrender.""  ""Romantic art begins with its climax.""  ""I must keep an opportunity for retreat.""  ""In the Parthian manner?""  ""They found safety in the desert.  I could not do that.""  ""Women are not always allowed a choice,"" he answered, but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.  Everybody started up.  The duchess stood motionless in horror.  And with fear in his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.  He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of the sofas.  After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression.  ""What has happened?"" he asked.  ""Oh!  I remember.  Am I safe here, Harry?"" He began to tremble.  ""My dear Dorian,"" answered Lord Henry, ""you merely fainted.  That was all.  You must have overtired yourself.  You had better not come down to dinner.  I will take your place.""  ""No, I will come down,"" he said, struggling to his feet.  ""I would rather come down.  I must not be alone.""  He went to his room and dressed.  There was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.      The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet indifferent to life itself.  The consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down, had begun to dominate him.  If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind, he shook.  The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets.  When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart.  But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him.  Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination.  It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin.  It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood.  In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded.  Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak.  That was all.  Besides, had any stranger been prowling round the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers.  Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have reported it.  Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him.  He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea.  From him, at any rate, he was safe.  Why, the man did not know who he was, could not know who he was.  The mask of youth had saved him.  And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them visible form, and make them move before one!  What sort of life would his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep! As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder.  Oh! in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend!  How ghastly the mere memory of the scene!  He saw it all again.  Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror.  Out of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin.  When Lord Henry came in at six o'clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.  It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out.  There was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life.  But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change.  His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so.  Their strong passions must either bruise or bend.  They either slay the man, or themselves die.  Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.  The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt.  After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass.  The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal.  A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.  At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun.  He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth.  ""Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?"" he asked.  ""Not very good, Dorian.  I think most of the birds have gone to the open.  I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new ground.""  Dorian strolled along by his side.  The keen aromatic air, the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom.  He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.  Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward, started a hare.  It bolted for a thicket of alders.  Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, ""Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.  Let it live.""  ""What nonsense, Dorian!"" laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded into the thicket, he fired.  There were two cries heard, the cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.  ""Good heavens!  I have hit a beater!"" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.  ""What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns!  Stop shooting there!"" he called out at the top of his voice.  ""A man is hurt.""  The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.  ""Where, sir?  Where is he?"" he shouted.  At the same time, the firing ceased along the line.  ""Here,"" answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket. ""Why on earth don't you keep your men back?  Spoiled my shooting for the day.""  Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe swinging branches aside.  In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight.  He turned away in horror.  It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.  He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper.  The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces.  There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices.  A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.  After a few moments--that were to him, in his perturbed state, like endless hours of pain--he felt a hand laid on his shoulder.  He started and looked round.  ""Dorian,"" said Lord Henry, ""I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.""  ""I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,"" he answered bitterly.  ""The whole thing is hideous and cruel.  Is the man ...?""  He could not finish the sentence.  ""I am afraid so,"" rejoined Lord Henry.  ""He got the whole charge of shot in his chest.  He must have died almost instantaneously.  Come; let us go home.""  They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking.  Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, ""It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.""  ""What is?"" asked Lord Henry.  ""Oh! this accident, I suppose.  My dear fellow, it can't be helped.  It was the man's own fault.  Why did he get in front of the guns?  Besides, it is nothing to us.  It is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course.  It does not do to pepper beaters.  It makes people think that one is a wild shot.  And Geoffrey is not; he shoots very straight.  But there is no use talking about the matter.""  Dorian shook his head.  ""It is a bad omen, Harry.  I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us.  To myself, perhaps,"" he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.  The elder man laughed.  ""The only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_, Dorian.  That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.  But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner.  I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed.  As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen.  Destiny does not send us heralds.  She is too wise or too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian?  You have everything in the world that a man can want.  There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you.""  ""There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry.  Don't laugh like that.  I am telling you the truth.  The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am.  I have no terror of death.  It is the coming of death that terrifies me.  Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me.  Good heavens! don't you see a man moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?""  Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing.  ""Yes,"" he said, smiling, ""I see the gardener waiting for you.  I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow!  You must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.""  Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.  The man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. ""Her Grace told me to wait for an answer,"" he murmured.  Dorian put the letter into his pocket.  ""Tell her Grace that I am coming in,"" he said, coldly.  The man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house.  ""How fond women are of doing dangerous things!"" laughed Lord Henry. ""It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most.  A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.""  ""How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry!  In the present instance, you are quite astray.  I like the duchess very much, but I don't love her.""  ""And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you are excellently matched.""  ""You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for scandal.""  ""The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,"" said Lord Henry, lighting a cigarette.  ""You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.""  ""The world goes to the altar of its own accord,"" was the answer.  ""I wish I could love,"" cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice.  ""But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire.  I am too much concentrated on myself.  My own personality has become a burden to me.  I want to escape, to go away, to forget.  It was silly of me to come down here at all.  I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready.  On a yacht one is safe.""  ""Safe from what, Dorian?  You are in some trouble.  Why not tell me what it is?  You know I would help you.""  ""I can't tell you, Harry,"" he answered sadly.  ""And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine.  This unfortunate accident has upset me.  I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.""  ""What nonsense!""  ""I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it.  Ah! here is the duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown.  You see we have come back, Duchess.""  ""I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,"" she answered.  ""Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset.  And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare. How curious!""  ""Yes, it was very curious.  I don't know what made me say it.  Some whim, I suppose.  It looked the loveliest of little live things.  But I am sorry they told you about the man.  It is a hideous subject.""  ""It is an annoying subject,"" broke in Lord Henry.  ""It has no psychological value at all.  Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose, how interesting he would be!  I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder.""  ""How horrid of you, Harry!"" cried the duchess.  ""Isn't it, Mr. Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again.  He is going to faint.""  Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled.  ""It is nothing, Duchess,"" he murmured; ""my nerves are dreadfully out of order.  That is all.  I am afraid I walked too far this morning.  I didn't hear what Harry said.  Was it very bad?  You must tell me some other time.  I think I must go and lie down.  You will excuse me, won't you?""  They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace.  As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.  ""Are you very much in love with him?"" he asked.  She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. ""I wish I knew,"" she said at last.  He shook his head.  ""Knowledge would be fatal.  It is the uncertainty that charms one.  A mist makes things wonderful.""  ""One may lose one's way.""  ""All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.""  ""What is that?""  ""Disillusion.""  ""It was my _debut_ in life,"" she sighed.  ""It came to you crowned.""  ""I am tired of strawberry leaves.""  ""They become you.""  ""Only in public.""  ""You would miss them,"" said Lord Henry.  ""I will not part with a petal.""  ""Monmouth has ears.""  ""Old age is dull of hearing.""  ""Has he never been jealous?""  ""I wish he had been.""  He glanced about as if in search of something.  ""What are you looking for?"" she inquired.  ""The button from your foil,"" he answered.  ""You have dropped it.""  She laughed.  ""I have still the mask.""  ""It makes your eyes lovelier,"" was his reply.  She laughed again.  Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit.  Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror in every tingling fibre of his body.  Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear.  The dreadful death of the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also.  He had nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.  At five o'clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another night at Selby Royal.  It was an ill-omened place.  Death walked there in the sunlight.  The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.  Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence.  As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see him.  He frowned and bit his lip.  ""Send him in,"" he muttered, after some moments' hesitation.  As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and spread it out before him.  ""I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning, Thornton?"" he said, taking up a pen.  ""Yes, sir,"" answered the gamekeeper.  ""Was the poor fellow married?  Had he any people dependent on him?"" asked Dorian, looking bored.  ""If so, I should not like them to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.""  ""We don't know who he is, sir.  That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about.""  ""Don't know who he is?"" said Dorian, listlessly.  ""What do you mean? Wasn't he one of your men?""  ""No, sir.  Never saw him before.  Seems like a sailor, sir.""  The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating.  ""A sailor?"" he cried out.  ""Did you say a sailor?""  ""Yes, sir.  He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both arms, and that kind of thing.""  ""Was there anything found on him?"" said Dorian, leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes.  ""Anything that would tell his name?""  ""Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any kind.  A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we think.""  Dorian started to his feet.  A terrible hope fluttered past him.  He clutched at it madly.  ""Where is the body?"" he exclaimed.  ""Quick!  I must see it at once.""  ""It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir.  The folk don't like to have that sort of thing in their houses.  They say a corpse brings bad luck.""  ""The Home Farm!  Go there at once and meet me.  Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round.  No. Never mind.  I'll go to the stables myself.  It will save time.""  In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go.  The trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path.  Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him. He lashed her across the neck with his crop.  She cleft the dusky air like an arrow.  The stones flew from her hoofs.  At last he reached the Home Farm.  Two men were loitering in the yard. He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.  In the farthest stable a light was glimmering.  Something seemed to tell him that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch.  There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life.  Then he thrust the door open and entered.  On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers.  A spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face.  A coarse candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.  Dorian Gray shuddered.  He felt that his could not be the hand to take the ha"|2
29|"ndkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him.  ""Take that thing off the face.  I wish to see it,"" he said, clutching at the door-post for support.  When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward.  A cry of joy broke from his lips.  The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane.  He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body.  As he rode home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.      ""There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,"" cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose-water. ""You are quite perfect.  Pray, don't change.""  Dorian Gray shook his head.  ""No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful things in my life.  I am not going to do any more.  I began my good actions yesterday.""  ""Where were you yesterday?""  ""In the country, Harry.  I was staying at a little inn by myself.""  ""My dear boy,"" said Lord Henry, smiling, ""anybody can be good in the country.  There are no temptations there.  That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to.  There are only two ways by which man can reach it.  One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt.  Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.""  ""Culture and corruption,"" echoed Dorian.  ""I have known something of both.  It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together.  For I have a new ideal, Harry.  I am going to alter.  I think I have altered.""  ""You have not yet told me what your good action was.  Or did you say you had done more than one?"" asked his companion as he spilled into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.  ""I can tell you, Harry.  It is not a story I could tell to any one else.  I spared somebody.  It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean.  She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane.  I think it was that which first attracted me to her.  You remember Sibyl, don't you?  How long ago that seems!  Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course.  She was simply a girl in a village.  But I really loved her.  I am quite sure that I loved her.  All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a week.  Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing.  We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her.""  ""I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure, Dorian,"" interrupted Lord Henry.  ""But I can finish your idyll for you.  You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That was the beginning of your reformation.""  ""Harry, you are horrible!  You mustn't say these dreadful things. Hetty's heart is not broken.  Of course, she cried and all that.  But there is no disgrace upon her.  She can live, like Perdita, in her garden of mint and marigold.""  ""And weep over a faithless Florizel,"" said Lord Henry, laughing, as he leaned back in his chair.  ""My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously boyish moods.  Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank?  I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.  Well, the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will be wretched.  From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation.  Even as a beginning, it is poor.  Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?""  ""I can't bear this, Harry!  You mock at everything, and then suggest the most serious tragedies.  I am sorry I told you now.  I don't care what you say to me.  I know I was right in acting as I did.  Poor Hetty!  As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine.  Don't let us talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin.  I want to be better.  I am going to be better.  Tell me something about yourself.  What is going on in town? I have not been to the club for days.""  ""The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance.""  ""I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,"" said Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.  ""My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months.  They have been very fortunate lately, however.  They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's suicide.  Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all.  I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco.  It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.  It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.""  ""What do you think has happened to Basil?"" asked Dorian, holding up his Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly.  ""I have not the slightest idea.  If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine.  If he is dead, I don't want to think about him.  Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.  I hate it.""  ""Why?"" said the younger man wearily.  ""Because,"" said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, ""one can survive everything nowadays except that.  Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.  Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian.  You must play Chopin to me.  The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.  Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her.  The house is rather lonely without her.  Of course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.  But then one regrets the loss even of one's worst habits.  Perhaps one regrets them the most.  They are such an essential part of one's personality.""  Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys.  After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, ""Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?""  Lord Henry yawned.  ""Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury watch.  Why should he have been murdered?  He was not clever enough to have enemies.  Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting.  But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible.  Basil was really rather dull.  He only interested me once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.""  ""I was very fond of Basil,"" said Dorian with a note of sadness in his voice.  ""But don't people say that he was murdered?""  ""Oh, some of the papers do.  It does not seem to me to be at all probable.  I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them.  He had no curiosity.  It was his chief defect.""  ""What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?"" said the younger man.  He watched him intently after he had spoken.  ""I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that doesn't suit you.  All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.  I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.  Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders.  I don't blame them in the smallest degree.  I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.""  ""A method of procuring sensations?  Do you think, then, that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again? Don't tell me that.""  ""Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing.  ""That is one of the most important secrets of life. I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.  One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.  But let us pass from poor Basil.  I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal.  Yes:  I should fancy that was his end.  I see him lying now on his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.  Do you know, I don't think he would have done much more good work.  During the last ten years his painting had gone off very much.""  Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch.  As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards.  ""Yes,"" he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket; ""his painting had quite gone off.  It seemed to me to have lost something.  It had lost an ideal.  When you and he ceased to be great friends, he ceased to be a great artist.  What was it separated you?  I suppose he bored you.  If so, he never forgave you.  It's a habit bores have.  By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you?  I don't think I have ever seen it since he finished it.  Oh!  I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way.  You never got it back?  What a pity! it was really a masterpiece.  I remember I wanted to buy it.  I wish I had now.  It belonged to Basil's best period.  Since then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.  Did you advertise for it?  You should.""  ""I forget,"" said Dorian.  ""I suppose I did.  But I never really liked it.  I am sorry I sat for it.  The memory of the thing is hateful to me.  Why do you talk of it?  It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play--Hamlet, I think--how do they run?--      ""Like the painting of a sorrow,      A face without a heart.""  Yes:  that is what it was like.""  Lord Henry laughed.  ""If a man treats life artistically, his brain is his heart,"" he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.  Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano. ""'Like the painting of a sorrow,'"" he repeated, ""'a face without a heart.'""  The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.  ""By the way, Dorian,"" he said after a pause, ""'what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his own soul'?""  The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend. ""Why do you ask me that, Harry?""  ""My dear fellow,"" said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise, ""I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer. That is all.  I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience.  It struck me as being rather dramatic.  London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion.  I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul, but that man had not.  I am afraid, however, he would not have understood me.""  ""Don't, Harry.  The soul is a terrible reality.  It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away.  It can be poisoned, or made perfect.  There is a soul in each one of us.  I know it.""  ""Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?""  ""Quite sure.""  ""Ah! then it must be an illusion.  The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.  That is the fatality of faith, and the lesson of romance.  How grave you are!  Don't be so serious.  What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age?  No:  we have given up our belief in the soul.  Play me something.  Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth.  You must have some secret.  I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.  You are really wonderful, Dorian.  You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.  You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.  You have changed, of course, but not in appearance.  I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.  Youth!  There is nothing like it.  It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth.  The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself.  They seem in front of me.  Life has revealed to them her latest wonder.  As for the aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle.  If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing.  How lovely that thing you are playing is!  I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes?  It is marvellously romantic.  What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative!  Don't stop.  I want music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of.  The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.  I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.  Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had!  You have drunk deeply of everything.  You have crushed the grapes against your palate.  Nothing has been hidden from you.  And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music.  It has not marred you.  You are still the same.""  ""I am not the same, Harry.""  ""Yes, you are the same.  I wonder what the rest of your life will be. Don't spoil it by renunciations.  At present you are a perfect type. Don't make yourself incomplete.  You are quite flawless now.  You need not shake your head:  you know you are.  Besides, Dorian, don't deceive yourself.  Life is not governed by will or intention.  Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.  You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong.  But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend.  Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.  There are moments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again.  I wish I could change places with you, Dorian.  The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you.  It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found.  I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself!  Life has been your art.  You have set yourself to music.  Your days are your sonnets.""  Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair. ""Yes, life has been exquisite,"" he murmured, ""but I am not going to have the same life, Harry.  And you must not say these extravagant things to me.  You don't know everything about me.  I think that if you did, even you would turn from me.  You laugh.  Don't laugh.""  ""Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?  Go back and give me the nocturne over again.  Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air.  She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she will come closer to the earth.  You won't?  Let us go to the club, then.  It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly.  There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son.  He has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.  He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you.""  ""I hope not,"" said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes.  ""But I am tired to-night, Harry.  I shan't go to the club.  It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed early.""  ""Do stay.  You have never played so well as to-night. There was something in your touch that was wonderful.  It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before.""  ""It is because I am going to be good,"" he answered, smiling.  ""I am a little changed already.""  ""You cannot change to me, Dorian,"" said Lord Henry.  ""You and I will always be friends.""  ""Yet you poisoned me with a book once.  I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.  It does harm.""  ""My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.  You will soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired.  You are much too delightful to do that.  Besides, it is no use.  You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be.  As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing as that.  Art has no influence upon action.  It annihilates the desire to act.  It is superbly sterile.  The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame. That is all.  But we won't discuss literature.  Come round to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven.  We might go together, and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.  She is a charming woman, and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying. Mind you come.  Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?  She says she never sees you now.  Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?  I thought you would be.  Her clever tongue gets on one's nerves.  Well, in any case, be here at eleven.""  ""Must I really come, Harry?""  ""Certainly.  The park is quite lovely now.  I don't think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you.""  ""Very well.  I shall be here at eleven,"" said Dorian.  ""Good night, Harry.""  As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say.  Then he sighed and went out.      It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.  As he strolled home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.  He heard one of them whisper to the other, ""That is Dorian Gray."" He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about.  He was tired of hearing his own name now.  Half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was.  He had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.  He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.  What a laugh she had!--just like a thrush singing.  And how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!  She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.  When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.  He sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.  Was it really true that one could never change?  He felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood--his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it.  He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.  But was it all irretrievable?  Was there no hope for him?  Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth!  All his failure had been due to that.  Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it.  There was purification in punishment. Not ""Forgive us our sins"" but ""Smite us for our iniquities"" should be the prayer of man to a most just God.  The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as of old.  He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield.  Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: ""The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.  The curves of your lips rewrite history.""  The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to himself.  Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel.  It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for.  But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain.  His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.  What was youth at best?  A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.  Why had he worn its livery?  Youth had spoiled him.  It was better not to think of the past.  Nothing could alter that.  It was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.  James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.  Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know.  The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away.  It was already waning.  He was perfectly safe there.  Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.  It was the living death of his own soul that troubled him.  Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life.  He could not forgive him that.  It was the portrait that had done everything.  Basil had said things to him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.  The murder had been simply the madness of a moment.  As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own act.  He had chosen to do it.  It was nothing to him.  A new life!  That was what he wanted.  That was what he was waiting for.  Surely he had begun it already.  He had spared one innocent thing, at any rate.  He would never again tempt innocence.  He would be good.  As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed.  Surely it was not still so horrible as it had been?  Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face.  Perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away.  He would go and look.  He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.  As he unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his lips.  Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him.  He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.  He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.  A cry of pain and indignation broke from him.  He could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.  The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if possible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.  Then he trembled.  Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?  Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh?  Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves?  Or, perhaps, all these?  And why was the red stain larger than it had been?  It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.  There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.  Confess?  Did it mean that he was to confess?  To give himself up and be put to death?  He laughed.  He felt that the idea was monstrous.  Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him?  There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him had been destroyed.  He himself had burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.  There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven.  Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin.  His sin?  He shrugged his shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.  He was thinking of Hetty Merton.  For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at.  Vanity?  Curiosity?  Hypocrisy?  Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that?  There had been something more.  At least he thought so.  But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing more.  Through vanity he had spared her.  In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.  For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self.  He recognized that now.  But this murder--was it to dog him all his life?  Was he always to be burdened by his past?  Was he really to confess?  Never.  There was only one bit of evidence left against him.  The picture itself--that was evidence.  He would destroy it.  Why had he kept it so long?  Once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.  Of late he had felt no such pleasure.  It had kept him awake at night. When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it.  It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy.  It had been like conscience to him.  Yes, it had been conscience.  He would destroy it.  He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.  He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.  It was bright, and glistened.  As it had killed the painter, so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that meant.  It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be free.  It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace.  He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.  There was a cry heard, and a crash.  The cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms. Two gentlem"|2
30|"en, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked up at the great house.  They walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back.  The man rang the bell several times, but there was no answer.  Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all dark.  After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched.  ""Whose house is that, Constable?"" asked the elder of the two gentlemen.  ""Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,"" answered the policeman.  They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.  One of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.  Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other.  Old Mrs. Leaf was crying and wringing her hands.  Francis was as pale as death.  After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept upstairs.  They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out.  Everything was still.  Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony.  The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old.  When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty.  Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart.  He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage.  It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.                                    SCENE  _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_; _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are passing into the Cathedral_.  [_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]     Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another    step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of    yours!                                  [_Sits down on the step of the fountain_.]  GUIDO     I think it must be here.  [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]    Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa    Croce?  [_Citizen bows_.]  I thank you, sir.  ASCANIO     Well?  GUIDO     Ay! it is here.  ASCANIO     I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.  GUIDO     [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ?The hour noon;    the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip's    Day.?  ASCANIO     And what of the man, how shall we know him?  GUIDO [_reading still_]     ?I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the    shoulder.?  A brave attire, Ascanio.  ASCANIO     I?d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of    your father?  GUIDO     Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,    just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a    man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,    signed ?Your Father's Friend,? bidding me be here to-day if I would    know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the    writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me    that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by    some one he had never since seen.  ASCANIO     And you don?t know who your father is?  GUIDO     No.  ASCANIO     No recollection of him even?  GUIDO     None, Ascanio, none.  ASCANIO [_laughing_]     Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did    mine.  GUIDO [_smiling_]     I am sure you never deserved it.  ASCANIO     Never; and that made it worse.  I hadn?t the consciousness of guilt to    buoy me up.  What hour did you say he fixed?  GUIDO     Noon.                                         [_Clock in the Cathedral strikes_.]  ASCANIO     It is that now, and your man has not come.  I don?t believe in him,    Guido.  I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I    have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me    to the nearest tavern.  [_Rises_.]  By the great gods of eating,    Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as tired as a young    maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk's sermon.  Come, Guido,    you stand there looking at nothing, like the fool who tried to look    into his own mind; your man will not come.  GUIDO     Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!  [_Just as he is leaving the stage    with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a    silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the    Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches    him_.]  MORANZONE     Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.  GUIDO     What!  Does my father live?  MORANZONE     Ay! lives in thee.    Thou art the same in mould and lineament,    Carriage and form, and outward semblances;    I trust thou art in noble mind the same.  GUIDO     Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived    But for this moment.  MORANZONE     We must be alone.  GUIDO     This is my dearest friend, who out of love    Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,    There is no secret which we do not share.  MORANZONE     There is one secret which ye shall not share;    Bid him go hence.  GUIDO [_to_ ASCANIO]     Come back within the hour.    He does not know that nothing in this world    Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.    Within the hour come.  ASCANIO     Speak not to him,    There is a dreadful terror in his look.  GUIDO [_laughing_]     Nay, nay, I doubt not that he has come to tell    That I am some great Lord of Italy,    And we will have long days of joy together.    Within the hour, dear Ascanio.                                                           [_Exit_ ASCANIO.]     Now tell me of my father?  [_Sits down on a stone seat_.]    Stood he tall?    I warrant he looked tall upon his horse.    His hair was black? or perhaps a reddish gold,    Like a red fire of gold?  Was his voice low?    The very bravest men have voices sometimes    Full of low music; or a clarion was it    That brake with terror all his enemies?    Did he ride singly? or with many squires    And valiant gentlemen to serve his state?    For oftentimes methinks I feel my veins    Beat with the blood of kings.  Was he a king?  MORANZONE     Ay, of all men he was the kingliest.  GUIDO [_proudly_]     Then when you saw my noble father last    He was set high above the heads of men?  MORANZONE     Ay, he was high above the heads of men,  [_Walks over to_ GUIDO _and puts his hand upon his shoulder_.]     On a red scaffold, with a butcher's block    Set for his neck.  GUIDO [_leaping up_]     What dreadful man art thou,    That like a raven, or the midnight owl,    Com'st with this awful message from the grave?  MORANZONE     I am known here as the Count Moranzone,    Lord of a barren castle on a rock,    With a few acres of unkindly land    And six not thrifty servants.  But I was one    Of Parma's noblest princes; more than that,    I was your father's friend.  GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]     Tell me of him.  MORANZONE     You are the son of that great Duke Lorenzo,    He was the Prince of Parma, and the Duke    Of all the fair domains of Lombardy    Down to the gates of Florence; nay, Florence even    Was wont to pay him tribute?  GUIDO     Come to his death.  MORANZONE     You will hear that soon enough.  Being at war?    O noble lion of war, that would not suffer    Injustice done in Italy!?he led    The very flower of chivalry against    That foul adulterous Lord of Rimini,    Giovanni Malatesta?whom God curse!    And was by him in treacherous ambush taken,    And like a villain, or a low-born knave,    Was by him on the public scaffold murdered.  GUIDO [_clutching his dagger_]     Doth Malatesta live?  MORANZONE     No, he is dead.  GUIDO     Did you say dead?  O too swift runner, Death,    Couldst thou not wait for me a little space,    And I had done thy bidding!  MORANZONE [_clutching his wrist_]     Thou canst do it!    The man who sold thy father is alive.  GUIDO     Sold! was my father sold?  MORANZONE     Ay! trafficked for,    Like a vile chattel, for a price betrayed,    Bartered and bargained for in privy market    By one whom he had held his perfect friend,    One he had trusted, one he had well loved,    One whom by ties of kindness he had bound?  GUIDO     And he lives    Who sold my father?  MORANZONE     I will bring you to him.  GUIDO     So, Judas, thou art living! well, I will make    This world thy field of blood, so buy it straight-way,    For thou must hang there.  MORANZONE     Judas said you, boy?    Yes, Judas in his treachery, but still    He was more wise than Judas was, and held    Those thirty silver pieces not enough.  GUIDO     What got he for my father's blood?  MORANZONE     What got he?    Why cities, fiefs, and principalities,    Vineyards, and lands.  GUIDO     Of which he shall but keep    Six feet of ground to rot in.  Where is he,    This damned villain, this foul devil? where?    Show me the man, and come he cased in steel,    In complete panoply and pride of war,    Ay, guarded by a thousand men-at-arms,    Yet I shall reach him through their spears, and feel    The last black drop of blood from his black heart    Crawl down my blade.  Show me the man, I say,    And I will kill him.  MORANZONE [_coldly_]     Fool, what revenge is there?    Death is the common heritage of all,    And death comes best when it comes suddenly.                                                 [_Goes up close to_ GUIDO.]     Your father was betrayed, there is your cue;    For you shall sell the seller in his turn.    I will make you of his household, you shall sit    At the same board with him, eat of his bread?  GUIDO     O bitter bread!  MORANZONE     Thy palate is too nice,    Revenge will make it sweet.  Thou shalt o? nights    Pledge him in wine, drink from his cup, and be    His intimate, so he will fawn on thee,    Love thee, and trust thee in all secret things.    If he bid thee be merry thou must laugh,    And if it be his humour to be sad    Thou shalt don sables.  Then when the time is ripe?                                               [GUIDO _clutches his sword_.]     Nay, nay, I trust thee not; your hot young blood,    Undisciplined nature, and too violent rage    Will never tarry for this great revenge,    But wreck itself on passion.  GUIDO     Thou knowest me not.    Tell me the man, and I in everything    Will do thy bidding.  MORANZONE     Well, when the time is ripe,    The victim trusting and the occasion sure,    I will by sudden secret messenger    Send thee a sign.  GUIDO     How shall I kill him, tell me?  MORANZONE     That night thou shalt creep into his private chamber;    But if he sleep see that thou wake him first,    And hold thy hand upon his throat, ay! that way,    Then having told him of what blood thou art,    Sprung from what father, and for what revenge,    Bid him to pray for mercy; when he prays,    Bid him to set a price upon his life,    And when he strips himself of all his gold    Tell him thou needest not gold, and hast not mercy,    And do thy business straight away.  Swear to me    Thou wilt not kill him till I bid thee do it,    Or else I go to mine own house, and leave    Thee ignorant, and thy father unavenged.  GUIDO     Now by my father's sword?  MORANZONE     The common hangman    Brake that in sunder in the public square.  GUIDO     Then by my father's grave?  MORANZONE     What grave? what grave?    Your noble father lieth in no grave,    I saw his dust strewn on the air, his ashes    Whirled through the windy streets like common straws    To plague a beggar's eyesight, and his head,    That gentle head, set on the prison spike,    For the vile rabble in their insolence    To shoot their tongues at.  GUIDO     Was it so indeed?    Then by my father's spotless memory,    And by the shameful manner of his death,    And by the base betrayal by his friend,    For these at least remain, by these I swear    I will not lay my hand upon his life    Until you bid me, then?God help his soul,    For he shall die as never dog died yet.    And now, the sign, what is it?  MORANZONE     This dagger, boy;    It was your father's.  GUIDO     Oh, let me look at it!    I do remember now my reputed uncle,    That good old husbandman I left at home,    Told me a cloak wrapped round me when a babe    Bare too such yellow leopards wrought in gold;    I like them best in steel, as they are here,    They suit my purpose better.  Tell me, sir,    Have you no message from my father to me?  MORANZONE     Poor boy, you never saw that noble father,    For when by his false friend he had been sold,    Alone of all his gentlemen I escaped    To bear the news to Parma to the Duchess.  GUIDO     Speak to me of my mother.  MORANZONE     When thy mother    Heard my black news, she fell into a swoon,    And, being with untimely travail seized?    Bare thee into the world before thy time,    And then her soul went heavenward, to wait    Thy father, at the gates of Paradise.  GUIDO     A mother dead, a father sold and bartered!    I seem to stand on some beleaguered wall,    And messenger comes after messenger    With a new tale of terror; give me breath,    Mine ears are tired.  MORANZONE     When thy mother died,    Fearing our enemies, I gave it out    Thou wert dead also, and then privily    Conveyed thee to an ancient servitor,    Who by Perugia lived; the rest thou knowest.  GUIDO     Saw you my father afterwards?  MORANZONE     Ay! once;    In mean attire, like a vineyard dresser,    I stole to Rimini.  GUIDO [_taking his hand_]     O generous heart!  MORANZONE     One can buy everything in Rimini,    And so I bought the gaolers! when your father    Heard that a man child had been born to him,    His noble face lit up beneath his helm    Like a great fire seen far out at sea,    And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido,    To rear you worthy of him; so I have reared you    To revenge his death upon the friend who sold him.  GUIDO     Thou hast done well; I for my father thank thee.    And now his name?  MORANZONE     How you remind me of him,    You have each gesture that your father had.  GUIDO     The traitor's name?  MORANZONE     Thou wilt hear that anon;    The Duke and other nobles at the Court    Are coming hither.  GUIDO     What of that? his name?  MORANZONE     Do they not seem a valiant company    Of honourable, honest gentlemen?  GUIDO     His name, milord?  [_Enter the_ DUKE OF PADUA _with_ COUNT BARDI, MAFFIO, PETRUCCI, _and other gentlemen of his Court_.]  MORANZONE [_quickly_]     The man to whom I kneel    Is he who sold your father! mark me well.  GUIDO [_clutches hit dagger_]     The Duke!  MORANZONE     Leave off that fingering of thy knife.    Hast thou so soon forgotten?  [_Kneels to the_ DUKE.]    My noble Lord.  DUKE     Welcome, Count Moranzone; ?tis some time    Since we have seen you here in Padua.    We hunted near your castle yesterday?    Call you it castle? that bleak house of yours    Wherein you sit a-mumbling o?er your beads,    Telling your vices like a good old man.                               [_Catches sight of_ GUIDO _and starts back_.]     Who is that?  MORANZONE     My sister's son, your Grace,    Who being now of age to carry arms,    Would for a season tarry at your Court  DUKE [_still looking at_ GUIDO]     What is his name?  MORANZONE     Guido Ferranti, sir.  DUKE     His city?  MORANZONE     He is Mantuan by birth.  DUKE [_advancing towards_ GUIDO]     You have the eyes of one I used to know,    But he died childless.  Are you honest, boy?    Then be not spendthrift of your honesty,    But keep it to yourself; in Padua    Men think that honesty is ostentatious, so    It is not of the fashion.  Look at these lords.  COUNT BARDI [_aside_]     Here is some bitter arrow for us, sure.  DUKE     Why, every man among them has his price,    Although, to do them justice, some of them    Are quite expensive.  COUNT BARDI [_aside_]     There it comes indeed.  DUKE     So be not honest; eccentricity    Is not a thing should ever be encouraged,    Although, in this dull stupid age of ours,    The most eccentric thing a man can do    Is to have brains, then the mob mocks at him;    And for the mob, despise it as I do,    I hold its bubble praise and windy favours    In such account, that popularity    Is the one insult I have never suffered.  MAFFIO [_aside_]     He has enough of hate, if he needs that.  DUKE     Have prudence; in your dealings with the world    Be not too hasty; act on the second thought,    First impulses are generally good.  GUIDO [_aside_]     Surely a toad sits on his lips, and spills its venom there.  DUKE     See thou hast enemies,    Else will the world think very little of thee;    It is its test of power; yet see thou show'st    A smiling mask of friendship to all men,    Until thou hast them safely in thy grip,    Then thou canst crush them.  GUIDO [_aside_]     O wise philosopher!    That for thyself dost dig so deep a grave.  MORANZONE [_to him_]     Dost thou mark his words?  GUIDO     Oh, be thou sure I do.  DUKE     And be not over-scrupulous; clean hands    With nothing in them make a sorry show.    If you would have the lion's share of life    You must wear the fox's skin.  Oh, it will fit you;    It is a coat which fitteth every man.  GUIDO     Your Grace, I shall remember.  DUKE     That is well, boy, well.    I would not have about me shallow fools,    Who with mean scruples weigh the gold of life,    And faltering, paltering, end by failure; failure,    The only crime which I have not committed:    I would have _men_ about me.  As for conscience,    Conscience is but the name which cowardice    Fleeing from battle scrawls upon its shield.    You understand me, boy?  GUIDO     I do, your Grace,    And will in all things carry out the creed    Which you have taught me.  MAFFIO     I never heard your Grace    So much in the vein for preaching; let the Cardinal    Look to his laurels, sir.  DUKE     The Cardinal!    Men follow my creed, and they gabble his.    I do not think much of the Cardinal;    Although he is a holy churchman, and    I quite admit his dulness.  Well, sir, from now    We count you of our household  [_He holds out his hand for_ GUIDO _to kiss_.  GUIDO _starts back in horror_, _but at a gesture from_ COUNT MORANZONE, _kneels and kisses it_.]     We will see    That you are furnished with such equipage    As doth befit your honour and our state.  GUIDO     I thank your Grace most heartily.  DUKE     Tell me again    What is your name?  GUIDO     Guido Ferranti, sir.  DUKE     And you are Mantuan?  Look to your wives, my lords,    When such a gallant comes to Padua.    Thou dost well to laugh, Count Bardi; I have noted    How merry is that husband by whose hearth    Sits an uncomely wife.  MAFFIO     May it please your Grace,    The wives of Padua are above suspicion.  DUKE     What, are they so ill-favoured!  Let us go,    This Cardinal detains our pious Duchess;    His sermon and his beard want cutting both:    Will you come with us, sir, and hear a text    From holy Jerome?  MORANZONE [_bowing_]     My liege, there are some matters?  DUKE [_interrupting_]     Thou need'st make no excuse for missing mass.    Come, gentlemen.                                     [_Exit with his suite into Cathedral_.]  GUIDO [_after a pause_]     So the Duke sold my father;    I kissed his hand.  MORANZONE     Thou shalt do that many times.  GUIDO     Must it be so?  MORANZONE     Ay! thou hast sworn an oath.  GUIDO     That oath shall make me marble.  MORANZONE     Farewell, boy,    Thou wilt not see me till the time is ripe.  GUIDO     I pray thou comest quickly.  MORANZONE     I will come    When it is time; be ready.  GUIDO     Fear me not.  MORANZONE     Here is your friend; see that you banish him    Both from your heart and Padua.  GUIDO     From Padua,    Not from my heart.  MORANZONE     Nay, from thy heart as well,    I will not leave thee till I see thee do it.  GUIDO     Can I have no friend?  MORANZONE     Revenge shall be thy friend;    Thou need'st no other.  GUIDO     Well, then be it so.                                               [_Enter_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]  ASCANIO     Come, Guido, I have been beforehand with you in everything, for I have    drunk a flagon of wine, eaten a pasty, and kissed the maid who served    it.  Why, you look as melancholy as a schoolboy who cannot buy apples,    or a politician who cannot sell his vote.  What news, Guido, what    news?  GUIDO     Why, that we two must part, Ascanio.  ASCANIO     That would be news indeed, but it is not true.  GUIDO     Too true it is, you must get hence, Ascanio,    And never look upon my face again.  ASCANIO     No, no; indeed you do not know me, Guido;    ?Tis true I am a common yeoman's son,    Nor versed in fashions of much courtesy;    But, if you are nobly born, cannot I be    Your serving man?  I will tend you with more love    Than any hired servant.  GUIDO [_clasping his hand_]     Ascanio!       [_Sees_ MORANZONE _looking at him and drops_ ASCANIO?S _hand_.]     It cannot be.  ASCANIO     What, is it so with you?    I thought the friendship of the antique world    Was not yet dead, but that the Roman type    Might even in this poor and common age    Find counterparts of love; then by this love    Which beats between us like a summer sea,    Whatever lot has fallen to your hand    May I not share it?  GUIDO     Share it?  ASCANIO     Ay!  GUIDO     No, no.  ASCANIO     Have you then come to some inheritance    Of lordly castle, or of stored-up gold?  GUIDO [_bitterly_]     Ay! I have come to my inheritance.    O bloody legacy! and O murderous dole!    Which, like the thrifty miser, must I hoard,    And to my own self keep; and so, I pray you,    Let us part here.  ASCANIO     What, shall we never more    Sit hand in hand, as we were wont to sit,    Over some book of ancient chivalry    Stealing a truant holiday from school,    Follow the huntsmen through the autumn woods,    And watch the falcons burst their tasselled jesses,    When the hare breaks from covert.  GUIDO     Never more.  ASCANIO     Must I go hence without a word of love?  GUIDO     You must go hence, and may love go with you.  ASCANIO     You are unknightly, and ungenerous.  GUIDO     Unknightly and ungenerous if you will.    Why should we waste more words about the matter    Let us part now.  ASCANIO     Have you no message, Guido?  GUIDO     None; my whole past was but a schoolboy's dream;    To-day my life begins.  Farewell.  ASCANIO     Farewell [_exit slowly_.]  GUIDO     Now are you satisfied?  Have you not seen    My dearest friend, and my most loved companion,    Thrust from me like a common kitchen knave!    Oh, that I did it!  Are you not satisfied?  MORANZONE     Ay! I am satisfied.  Now I go hence,    Do not forget the sign, your father's dagger,    And do the business when I send it to you.  GUIDO     Be sure I shall.  [_Exit_ LORD MORANZONE.]  GUIDO     O thou eternal heaven!    If there is aught of nature in my soul,    Of gentle pity, or fond kindliness,    Wither it up, blast it, bring it to nothing,    Or if thou wilt not, then will I myself    Cut pity with a sharp knife from my heart    And strangle mercy in her sleep at night    Lest she speak to me.  Vengeance there I have it.    Be thou my comrade and my bedfellow,    Sit by my side, ride to the chase with me,    When I am weary sing me pretty songs,    When I am light o? heart, make jest with me,    And when I dream, whisper into my ear    The dreadful secret of a father's murder?    Did I say murder?  [_Draws his dagger_.]    Listen, thou terrible God!    Thou God that punishest all broken oaths,    And bid some angel write this oath in fire,    That from this hour, till my dear father's murder    In blood I have revenged, I do forswear    The noble ties of honourable friendship,    The noble joys of dear companionship,    Affection's bonds, and loyal gratitude,    Ay, more, from this same hour I do forswear    All love of women, and the barren thing    Which men call beauty?  [_The organ peals in the Cathedral_, _and under a canopy of cloth of silver tissue_, _borne by four pages in scarlet_, _the_ DUCHESS OF PADUA _comes down the steps_; _as she passes across their eyes meet for a moment_, _and as she leaves the stage she looks back at_ GUIDO, _and the dagger falls from his hand_.]     Oh! who is that?  A CITIZEN     The Duchess of Padua!  ACT II                                     SCENE  _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_. _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of_ ?_Death to the Duke_?: _after a little interval enter the Duke very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.  DUKE     No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!    Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.  MAFFIO [_excitedly_]     Your Grace, there are two thousand people there    Who every moment grow more clamorous.  DUKE     Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!    People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;    The only men I fear are silent men.                                                 [_A yell from the people_.]     You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.                                                           [_Another yell_.]     Go, Petrucci,    And tell the captain of the guard below    To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?    Do what I bid you.                                                          [_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]  CARDINAL     I beseech your Grace    To listen to their grievances.  DUKE [_sitting on his throne_]     Ay! the peaches    Are not so big this year as they were last.    I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,    I thought you spake of peaches.                                                [_A cheer from the people_.]     What is that?  GUIDO [_rushes to the window_]     The Duchess has gone forth into the square,    And stands between the people and the guard,    And will not let them shoot.  DUKE     The devil take her!  GUIDO [_still at the window_]     And followed by a dozen of the citizens    Has come into the Palace.  DUKE [_starting up_]     By Saint James,    Our Duchess waxes bold!  BARDI     Here comes the Duchess.  DUKE     Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.                                    [_They close the door on the corridor_.]  [_Enter the Duchess followed by a crowd of meanly dressed Citizens_.]  DUCHESS [_flinging herself upon her knees_]     I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.  DUKE     What are these grievances?  DUCHESS     Alas, my Lord,    Such common things as neither you nor I,    Nor any of these noble gentlemen,    Have ever need at all to think about;    They say the bread, the very bread they eat,    Is made of sorry chaff.  FIRST CITIZEN     Ay! so it is,    Nothing but chaff.  DUKE     And very good food too,    I give it to my horses.  DUCHESS [_restraining herself_]     They say the water,    Set in the public cisterns for their use,    [Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]    To stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.  DUKE     They should drink wine; water is quite unwholesome.  SECOND CITIZEN     Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs    Take at the city gate are"|2
31| grown so high    We cannot buy wine.  DUKE     Then you should bless the taxes     Which make you temperate.  DUCHESS     Think, while we sit    In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty    Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives    Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily    And no word said.  THIRD CITIZEN     Ay! marry, that is true,    My little son died yesternight from hunger;    He was but six years old; I am so poor,    I cannot bury him.  DUKE     If you are poor,    Are you not blessed in that?  Why, poverty    Is one of the Christian virtues,                                                  [_Turns to the_ CARDINAL.]     Is it not?    I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,    Rich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates    For preaching voluntary poverty.  DUCHESS     Nay but, my lord the Duke, be generous;    While we sit here within a noble house    [With shaded porticoes against the sun,    And walls and roofs to keep the winter out],    There are many citizens of Padua    Who in vile tenements live so full of holes,    That the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast,    Are tenants also with them; others sleep    Under the arches of the public bridges    All through the autumn nights, till the wet mist    Stiffens their limbs, and fevers come, and so?  DUKE     And so they go to Abraham's bosom, Madam.    They should thank me for sending them to Heaven,    If they are wretched here. [_To the_ CARDINAL.]    Is it not said    Somewhere in Holy Writ, that every man    Should be contented with that state of life    God calls him to?  Why should I change their state,    Or meddle with an all-wise providence,    Which has apportioned that some men should starve,    And others surfeit?  I did not make the world.  FIRST CITIZEN     He hath a hard heart.  SECOND CITIZEN     Nay, be silent, neighbour;    I think the Cardinal will speak for us.  CARDINAL     True, it is Christian to bear misery,    Yet it is Christian also to be kind,    And there seem many evils in this town,    Which in your wisdom might your Grace reform.  FIRST CITIZEN     What is that word reform?  What does it mean?  SECOND CITIZEN     Marry, it means leaving things as they are; I like it not.  DUKE     Reform Lord Cardinal, did _you_ say reform?    There is a man in Germany called Luther,    Who would reform the Holy Catholic Church.    Have you not made him heretic, and uttered    Anathema, maranatha, against him?  CARDINAL [_rising from his seat_]     He would have led the sheep out of the fold,    We do but ask of you to feed the sheep.  DUKE     When I have shorn their fleeces I may feed them.    As for these rebels?  [DUCHESS _entreats him_.]  FIRST CITIZEN     That is a kind word,    He means to give us something.  SECOND CITIZEN     Is that so?  DUKE     These ragged knaves who come before us here,    With mouths chock-full of treason.  THIRD CITIZEN     Good my Lord,    Fill up our mouths with bread; we?ll hold our tongues.  DUKE     Ye shall hold your tongues, whether you starve or not.    My lords, this age is so familiar grown,    That the low peasant hardly doffs his hat,    Unless you beat him; and the raw mechanic    Elbows the noble in the public streets.                                                        [_To the Citizens_.]     Still as our gentle Duchess has so prayed us,    And to refuse so beautiful a beggar    Were to lack both courtesy and love,    Touching your grievances, I promise this?  FIRST CITIZEN     Marry, he will lighten the taxes!  SECOND CITIZEN     Or a dole of bread, think you, for each man?  DUKE     That, on next Sunday, the Lord Cardinal    Shall, after Holy Mass, preach you a sermon    Upon the Beauty of Obedience.                                                        [_Citizens murmur_.]  FIRST CITIZEN     I? faith, that will not fill our stomachs!  SECOND CITIZEN     A sermon is but a sorry sauce, when    You have nothing to eat with it.  DUCHESS     Poor people,    You see I have no power with the Duke,    But if you go into the court without,    My almoner shall from my private purse,    Divide a hundred ducats ?mongst you all.  FIRST CITIZEN     God save the Duchess, say I.  SECOND CITIZEN     God save her.  DUCHESS     And every Monday morn shall bread be set    For those who lack it.                                            [_Citizens applaud and go out_.]  FIRST CITIZEN [_going out_]     Why, God save the Duchess again!  DUKE [_calling him back_]     Come hither, fellow! what is your name?  FIRST CITIZEN     Dominick, sir.  DUKE     A good name!  Why were you called Dominick?  FIRST CITIZEN [_scratching his head_]     Marry, because I was born on St. George's day.  DUKE     A good reason! here is a ducat for you!    Will you not cry for me God save the Duke?  FIRST CITIZEN [_feebly_]     God save the Duke.  DUKE     Nay! louder, fellow, louder.  FIRST CITIZEN [_a little louder_]     God save the Duke!  DUKE     More lustily, fellow, put more heart in it!    Here is another ducat for you.  FIRST CITIZEN [_enthusiastically_]     God save the Duke!  DUKE [_mockingly_]     Why, gentlemen, this simple fellow's love    Touches me much.  [_To the Citizen_, _harshly_.]    Go!  [_Exit Citizen_, _bowing_.]    This is the way, my lords,    You can buy popularity nowadays.    Oh, we are nothing if not democratic!                                                         [_To the_ DUCHESS.]     Well, Madam,    You spread rebellion ?midst our citizens.  DUCHESS     My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,    The right to pity, and the right to mercy.  DUKE     So, so, you argue with me?  This is she,    The gentle Duchess for whose hand I yielded    Three of the fairest towns in Italy,    Pisa, and Genoa, and Orvieto.  DUCHESS     Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter    Brake you your word as ever.  DUKE     You wrong us, Madam,    There were state reasons.  DUCHESS     What state reasons are there    For breaking holy promises to a state?  DUKE     There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest    Close to the city: when I promised Pisa    Unto your noble and most trusting father,    I had forgotten there was hunting there.    At Genoa they say,    Indeed I doubt them not, that the red mullet    Runs larger in the harbour of that town    Than anywhere in Italy.                                            [_Turning to one of the Court_.]     You, my lord,    Whose gluttonous appetite is your only god,    Could satisfy our Duchess on that point.  DUCHESS     And Orvieto?  DUKE [_yawning_]     I cannot now recall    Why I did not surrender Orvieto    According to the word of my contract.    Maybe it was because I did not choose.                                               [_Goes over to the_ DUCHESS.]     Why look you, Madam, you are here alone;    ?Tis many a dusty league to your grey France,    And even there your father barely keeps    A hundred ragged squires for his Court.    What hope have you, I say?  Which of these lords    And noble gentlemen of Padua    Stands by your side.  DUCHESS     There is not one.                                  [GUIDO _starts_, _but restrains himself_.]  DUKE     Nor shall be,    While I am Duke in Padua: listen, Madam,    Being mine own, you shall do as I will,    And if it be my will you keep the house,    Why then, this palace shall your prison be;    And if it be my will you walk abroad,    Why, you shall take the air from morn to night.  DUCHESS     Sir, by what right??  DUKE     Madam, my second Duchess    Asked the same question once: her monument    Lies in the chapel of Bartholomew,    Wrought in red marble; very beautiful.    Guido, your arm.  Come, gentlemen, let us go    And spur our falcons for the mid-day chase.    Bethink you, Madam, you are here alone.           [_Exit the_ DUKE _leaning on_ GUIDO, _with his Court_.]  DUCHESS [_looking after them_]     The Duke said rightly that I was alone;    Deserted, and dishonoured, and defamed,    Stood ever woman so alone indeed?    Men when they woo us call us pretty children,    Tell us we have not wit to make our lives,    And so they mar them for us.  Did I say woo?    We are their chattels, and their common slaves,    Less dear than the poor hound that licks their hand,    Less fondled than the hawk upon their wrist.    Woo, did I say? bought rather, sold and bartered,    Our very bodies being merchandise.    I know it is the general lot of women,    Each miserably mated to some man    Wrecks her own life upon his selfishness:    That it is general makes it not less bitter.    I think I never heard a woman laugh,    Laugh for pure merriment, except one woman,    That was at night time, in the public streets.    Poor soul, she walked with painted lips, and wore    The mask of pleasure: I would not laugh like her;    No, death were better.  [_Enter_ GUIDO _behind unobserved_; _the_ DUCHESS _flings herself down before a picture of the Madonna_.]     O Mary mother, with your sweet pale face    Bending between the little angel heads    That hover round you, have you no help for me?    Mother of God, have you no help for me?  GUIDO     I can endure no longer.    This is my love, and I will speak to her.    Lady, am I a stranger to your prayers?  DUCHESS [_rising_]     None but the wretched needs my prayers, my lord.  GUIDO     Then must I need them, lady.  DUCHESS     How is that?    Does not the Duke show thee sufficient honour?  GUIDO     Your Grace, I lack no favours from the Duke,    Whom my soul loathes as I loathe wickedness,    But come to proffer on my bended knees,    My loyal service to thee unto death.  DUCHESS     Alas!  I am so fallen in estate    I can but give thee a poor meed of thanks.  GUIDO [_seizing her hand_]     Hast thou no love to give me?          [_The_ DUCHESS _starts_, _and_ GUIDO _falls at her feet_.]     O dear saint,    If I have been too daring, pardon me!    Thy beauty sets my boyish blood aflame,    And, when my reverent lips touch thy white hand,    Each little nerve with such wild passion thrills    That there is nothing which I would not do    To gain thy love.  [_Leaps up_.]    Bid me reach forth and pluck    Perilous honour from the lion's jaws,    And I will wrestle with the Nemean beast    On the bare desert!  Fling to the cave of War    A gaud, a ribbon, a dead flower, something    That once has touched thee, and I?ll bring it back    Though all the hosts of Christendom were there,    Inviolate again! ay, more than this,    Set me to scale the pallid white-faced cliffs    Of mighty England, and from that arrogant shield    Will I raze out the lilies of your France    Which England, that sea-lion of the sea,    Hath taken from her!    O dear Beatrice,    Drive me not from thy presence! without thee    The heavy minutes crawl with feet of lead,    But, while I look upon thy loveliness,    The hours fly like winged Mercuries    And leave existence golden.  DUCHESS     I did not think    I should be ever loved: do you indeed    Love me so much as now you say you do?  GUIDO     Ask of the sea-bird if it loves the sea,    Ask of the roses if they love the rain,    Ask of the little lark, that will not sing    Till day break, if it loves to see the day:?    And yet, these are but empty images,    Mere shadows of my love, which is a fire    So great that all the waters of the main    Can not avail to quench it.  Will you not speak?  DUCHESS     I hardly know what I should say to you.  GUIDO     Will you not say you love me?  DUCHESS     Is that my lesson?    Must I say all at once?  ?Twere a good lesson    If I did love you, sir; but, if I do not,    What shall I say then?  GUIDO     If you do not love me,    Say, none the less, you do, for on your tongue    Falsehood for very shame would turn to truth.  DUCHESS     What if I do not speak at all?  They say    Lovers are happiest when they are in doubt  GUIDO     Nay, doubt would kill me, and if I must die,    Why, let me die for joy and not for doubt.    Oh, tell me may I stay, or must I go?  DUCHESS     I would not have you either stay or go;    For if you stay you steal my love from me,    And if you go you take my love away.    Guido, though all the morning stars could sing    They could not tell the measure of my love.    I love you, Guido.  GUIDO [_stretching out his hands_]     Oh, do not cease at all;    I thought the nightingale sang but at night;    Or if thou needst must cease, then let my lips    Touch the sweet lips that can such music make.  DUCHESS     To touch my lips is not to touch my heart.  GUIDO     Do you close that against me?  DUCHESS     Alas! my lord,    I have it not: the first day that I saw you    I let you take my heart away from me;    Unwilling thief, that without meaning it    Did break into my fenced treasury    And filch my jewel from it!  O strange theft,    Which made you richer though you knew it not,    And left me poorer, and yet glad of it!  GUIDO [_clasping her in his arms_]     O love, love, love!  Nay, sweet, lift up your head,    Let me unlock those little scarlet doors    That shut in music, let me dive for coral    In your red lips, and I?ll bear back a prize    Richer than all the gold the Gryphon guards    In rude Armenia.  DUCHESS     You are my lord,    And what I have is yours, and what I have not    Your fancy lends me, like a prodigal    Spending its wealth on what is nothing worth.                                                             [_Kisses him_.]  GUIDO     Methinks I am bold to look upon you thus:    The gentle violet hides beneath its leaf    And is afraid to look at the great sun    For fear of too much splendour, but my eyes,    O daring eyes! are grown so venturous    That like fixed stars they stand, gazing at you,    And surfeit sense with beauty.  DUCHESS     Dear love, I would    You could look upon me ever, for your eyes    Are polished mirrors, and when I peer    Into those mirrors I can see myself,    And so I know my image lives in you.  GUIDO [_taking her in his arms_]     Stand still, thou hurrying orb in the high heavens,    And make this hour immortal!  [_A pause_.]  DUCHESS     Sit down here,    A little lower than me: yes, just so, sweet,    That I may run my fingers through your hair,    And see your face turn upwards like a flower    To meet my kiss.    Have you not sometimes noted,    When we unlock some long-disus?d room    With heavy dust and soiling mildew filled,    Where never foot of man has come for years,    And from the windows take the rusty bar,    And fling the broken shutters to the air,    And let the bright sun in, how the good sun    Turns every grimy particle of dust    Into a little thing of dancing gold?    Guido, my heart is that long-empty room,    But you have let love in, and with its gold    Gilded all life.  Do you not think that love    Fills up the sum of life?  GUIDO     Ay! without love    Life is no better than the unhewn stone    Which in the quarry lies, before the sculptor    Has set the God within it.  Without love    Life is as silent as the common reeds    That through the marshes or by rivers grow,    And have no music in them.  DUCHESS     Yet out of these    The singer, who is Love, will make a pipe    And from them he draws music; so I think    Love will bring music out of any life.    Is that not true?  GUIDO     Sweet, women make it true.    There are men who paint pictures, and carve statues,    Paul of Verona and the dyer's son,    Or their great rival, who, by the sea at Venice,    Has set God's little maid upon the stair,    White as her own white lily, and as tall,    Or Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine    Because they are mothers merely; yet I think    Women are the best artists of the world,    For they can take the common lives of men    Soiled with the money-getting of our age,    And with love make them beautiful.  DUCHESS     Ah, dear,    I wish that you and I were very poor;    The poor, who love each other, are so rich.  GUIDO     Tell me again you love me, Beatrice.  DUCHESS [_fingering his collar_]     How well this collar lies about your throat.     [LORD MORANZONE _looks through the door from the corridor outside_.]  GUIDO     Nay, tell me that you love me.  DUCHESS     I remember,    That when I was a child in my dear France,    Being at Court at Fontainebleau, the King    Wore such a collar.  GUIDO     Will you not say you love me?  DUCHESS [_smiling_]     He was a very royal man, King Francis,    Yet he was not royal as you are.    Why need I tell you, Guido, that I love you?        [_Takes his head in her hands and turns his face up to her_.]     Do you not know that I am yours for ever,    Body and soul?   [_Kisses him_, _and then suddenly catches sight of_ MORANZONE _and leaps                                   up_.]     Oh, what is that?  [MORANZONE _disappears_.]  GUIDO     What, love?  DUCHESS     Methought I saw a face with eyes of flame    Look at us through the doorway.  GUIDO     Nay, ?twas nothing:    The passing shadow of the man on guard.            [_The_ DUCHESS _still stands looking at the window_.]     ?Twas nothing, sweet.  DUCHESS     Ay! what can harm us now,    Who are in Love's hand?  I do not think I?d care    Though the vile world should with its lackey Slander    Trample and tread upon my life; why should I?    They say the common field-flowers of the field    Have sweeter scent when they are trodden on    Than when they bloom alone, and that some herbs    Which have no perfume, on being bruis?d die    With all Arabia round them; so it is    With the young lives this dull world seeks to crush,    It does but bring the sweetness out of them,    And makes them lovelier often.  And besides,    While we have love we have the best of life:    Is it not so?  GUIDO     Dear, shall we play or sing?    I think that I could sing now.  DUCHESS     Do not speak,    For there are times when all existences    Seem narrowed to one single ecstasy,    And Passion sets a seal upon the lips.  GUIDO     Oh, with mine own lips let me break that seal!    You love me, Beatrice?  DUCHESS     Ay! is it not strange    I should so love mine enemy?  GUIDO     Who is he?  DUCHESS     Why, you: that with your shaft did pierce my heart!    Poor heart, that lived its little lonely life    Until it met your arrow.  GUIDO     Ah, dear love,    I am so wounded by that bolt myself    That with untended wounds I lie a-dying,    Unless you cure me, dear Physician.  DUCHESS     I would not have you cured; for I am sick    With the same malady.  GUIDO     Oh, how I love you!    See, I must steal the cuckoo's voice, and tell    The one tale over.  DUCHESS     Tell no other tale!    For, if that is the little cuckoo's song,    The nightingale is hoarse, and the loud lark    Has lost its music.  GUIDO     Kiss me, Beatrice!  [_She takes his face in her hands and bends down and kisses him_; _a loud knocking then comes at the door_, _and_ GUIDO _leaps up_; _enter a Servant_.]  SERVANT     A package for you, sir.  GUIDO [_carelessly_]     Ah! give it to me.     [_Servant hands package wrapped in vermilion silk_, _and exit_; _as_    GUIDO _is about to open it the_ DUCHESS _comes up behind_, _and in    sport takes it from him_.]  DUCHESS [_laughing_]     Now I will wager it is from some girl    Who would have you wear her favour; I am so jealous    I will not give up the least part in you,    But like a miser keep you to myself,    And spoil you perhaps in keeping.  GUIDO     It is nothing.  DUCHESS     Nay, it is from some girl.  GUIDO     You know ?tis not.  DUCHESS [_turns her back and opens it_]     Now, traitor, tell me what does this sign mean,    A dagger with two leopards wrought in steel?  GUIDO [_taking it from her_]     O God!  DUCHESS     I?ll from the window look, and try    If I can?t see the porter's livery    Who left it at the gate!  I will not rest    Till I have learned your secret.                                        [_Runs laughing into the corridor_.]  GUIDO     Oh, horrible!    Had I so soon forgot my father's death,    Did I so soon let love into my heart,    And must I banish love, and let in murder    That beats and clamours at the outer gate?    Ay, that I must!  Have I not sworn an oath?    Yet not to-night; nay, it must be to-night.    Farewell then all the joy and light of life,    All dear recorded memories, farewell,    Farewell all love!  Could I with bloody hands    Fondle and paddle with her innocent hands?    Could I with lips fresh from this butchery    Play with her lips?  Could I with murderous eyes    Look in those violet eyes, whose purity    Would strike men blind, and make each eyeball reel    In night perpetual?  No, murder has set    A barrier between us far too high    For us to kiss across it.  DUCHESS     Guido!  GUIDO     Beatrice,    You must forget that name, and banish me    Out of your life for ever.  DUCHESS [_going towards him_]     O dear love!  GUIDO [_stepping back_]     There lies a barrier between us two    We dare not pass.  DUCHESS     I dare do anything    So that you are beside me.  GUIDO     Ah!  There it is,    I cannot be beside you, cannot breathe    The air you breathe; I cannot any more    Stand face to face with beauty, which unnerves    My shaking heart, and makes my desperate hand    Fail of its purpose.  Let me go hence, I pray;    Forget you ever looked upon me.  DUCHESS     What!    With your hot kisses fresh upon my lips    Forget the vows of love you made to me?  GUIDO     I take them back.  DUCHESS     Alas, you cannot, Guido,    For they are part of nature now; the air    Is tremulous with their music, and outside    The little birds sing sweeter for those vows.  GUIDO     There lies a barrier between us now,    Which then I knew not, or I had forgot.  DUCHESS     There is no barrier, Guido; why, I will go    In poor attire, and will follow you    Over the world.  GUIDO [_wildly_]     The world's not wide enough    To hold us two!  Farewell, farewell for ever.  DUCHESS [_calm_, _and controlling her passion_]     Why did you come into my life at all, then,    Or in the desolate garden of my heart    Sow that white flower of love??  GUIDO     O Beatrice!  DUCHESS     Which now you would dig up, uproot, tear out,    Though each small fibre doth so hold my heart    That if you break one, my heart breaks with it?    Why did you come into my life?  Why open    The secret wells of love I had sealed up?    Why did you open them??  GUIDO     O God!  DUCHESS [_clenching her hand_]     And let    The floodgates of my passion swell and burst    Till, like the wave when rivers overflow    That sweeps the forest and the farm away,    Love in the splendid avalanche of its might    Swept my life with it?  Must I drop by drop    Gather these waters back and seal them up?    Alas!  Each drop will be a tear, and so    Will with its saltness make life very bitter.  GUIDO     I pray you speak no more, for I must go    Forth from your life and love, and make a way    On which you cannot follow.  DUCHESS     I have heard    That sailors dying of thirst upon a raft,    Poor castaways upon a lonely sea,    Dream of green fields and pleasant water-courses,    And then wake up with red thirst in their throats,    And die more miserably because sleep    Has cheated them: so they die cursing sleep    For having sent them dreams: I will not curse you    Though I am cast away upon the sea    Which men call Desolation.  GUIDO     O God, God!  DUCHESS     But you will stay: listen, I love you, Guido.                                                     [_She waits a little_.]     Is echo dead, that when I say I love you    There is no answer?  GUIDO     Everything is dead,    Save one thing only, which shall die to-night!  DUCHESS     If you are going, touch me not, but go.                                                             [_Exit_ GUIDO.]     Barrier!  Barrier!    Why did he say there was a barrier?    There is no barrier between us two.    He lied to me, and shall I for that reason    Loathe what I love, and what I worshipped, hate?    I think we women do not love like that.    For if I cut his image from my heart,    My heart would, like a bleeding pilgrim, follow    That image through the world, and call it back    With little cries of love.    [_Enter_ DUKE _equipped for the chase_, _with falconers and hounds_.]  DUKE     Madam, you keep us waiting;    You keep my dogs waiting.  DUCHESS     I will not ride to-day.  DUKE     How now, what's this?  DUCHESS     My Lord, I cannot go.  DUKE     What, pale face, do you dare to stand against me?    Why, I could set you on a sorry jade    And lead you through the town, till the low rabble    You feed toss up their hats and mock at you.  DUCHESS     Have you no word of kindness ever for me?  DUKE     I hold you in the hollow of my hand    And have no need on you to waste kind words.  DUCHESS     Well, I will go.  DUKE [_slapping his boot with his whip_]     No, I have changed my mind,    You will stay here, and like a faithful wife    Watch from the window for our coming back.    Were it not dreadful if some accident    By chance should happen to your loving Lord?    Come, gentlemen, my hounds begin to chafe,    And I chafe too, having a patient wife.    Where is young Guido?  MAFFIO     My liege, I have not seen him    For a full hour past.  DUKE     It matters not,    I dare say I shall see him soon enough.    Well, Madam, you will sit at home and spin.    I do protest, sirs, the domestic virtues    Are often very beautiful in others.                                             [_Exit_ DUKE _with his Court_.]  DUCHESS     The stars have fought against me, that is all,    And thus to-night when my Lord lieth asleep,    Will I fall upon my dagger, and so cease.    My heart is such a stone nothing can reach it    Except the dagger's edge: let it go there,    To find what name it carries: ay! to-night    Death will divorce the Duke; and yet to-night    He may die also, he is very old.    Why should he not die?  Yesterday his hand    Shook with a palsy: men have died from palsy,    And why not he?  Are there not fevers also,    Agues and chills, and other maladies    Most incident to old age?    No, no, he will not die, he is too sinful;    Honest men die before their proper time.    Good men will die: men by whose side the Duke    In all the sick pollution of his life    Seems like a leper: women and children die,    But the Duke will not die, he is too sinful.    Oh, can it be    There is some immortality in sin,    Which virtue has not?  And does the wicked man    Draw life from what to other men were death,    Like poisonous plants that on corruption live?    No, no, I think God would not suffer that:    Yet the Duke will not die: he is too sinful.    But I will die alone, and on this night    Grim Death shall be my bridegroom, and the tomb    My secret house of pleasure: well, what of that?    The world's a graveyard, and we each, like coffins,    Within us bear a skeleton.  [_Enter_ LORD MORANZONE _all in black_; _he passes across the back of the                      stage looking anxiously about_.]  MORANZONE     Where is Guido?    I cannot find him anywhere.  DUCHESS [_catches sight of him_]     O God!    ?Twas thou who took my love away from me.  MORANZONE [_with a look of joy_]     What, has he left you?  DUCHESS     Nay, you know he has.    Oh, give him back to me, give him back, I say,    Or I will tear your body limb from limb,    And to the common gibbet nail your head    Until the carrion crows have stripped it bare.    Better you had crossed a hungry lioness    Before you came between me and my love.                                                       [_With more pathos_.]     Nay, give him back, you know not how I love him.    Here by this chair he knelt a half hour since;    ?Twas there he stood, and there he looked at me;    This is the hand he kissed, and these the ears    Into whose open portals he did pour    A tale of love so musical that all    The birds stopped singing!  Oh, give him back to me.  MORANZONE     He does not love you, Madam.  DUCHESS     May the plague    Wither the tongue that says so!  Give him back.  MORANZONE     Madam, I tell you you will never see him,    Neither to-night, nor any other night.  DUCHESS     What is your name?  MORANZONE     My name?  Revenge!                                                                   [_Exit_.]  DUCHESS     Revenge!    I think I never harmed a little child.    Wha|2
32|t should Revenge do coming to my door?    It matters not, for Death is there already,    Waiting with his dim torch to light my way.    ?Tis true men hate thee, Death, and yet I think    Thou wilt be kinder to me than my lover,    And so dispatch the messengers at once,    Harry the lazy steeds of lingering day,    And let the night, thy sister, come instead,    And drape the world in mourning; let the owl,    Who is thy minister, scream from his tower    And wake the toad with hooting, and the bat,    That is the slave of dim Persephone,    Wheel through the sombre air on wandering wing!    Tear up the shrieking mandrakes from the earth    And bid them make us music, and tell the mole    To dig deep down thy cold and narrow bed,    For I shall lie within thine arms to-night.  ACT III                                     SCENE  _A large corridor in the Ducal Palace_: _a window_ (_L.C._) _looks out on a view of Padua by moonlight_: _a staircase_ (_R.C._) _leads up to a door with a porti?re of crimson velvet_, _with the Duke's arms embroidered in gold on it_: _on the lowest step of the staircase a figure draped in black is sitting_: _the hall is lit by an iron cresset filled with burning tow_: _thunder and lightning outside_: _the time is night_.                    [_Enter_ GUIDO _through the window_.]  GUIDO     The wind is rising: how my ladder shook!    I thought that every gust would break the cords!                                                  [_Looks out at the city_.]     Christ!  What a night:    Great thunder in the heavens, and wild lightnings    Striking from pinnacle to pinnacle    Across the city, till the dim houses seem    To shudder and to shake as each new glare    Dashes adown the street.                           [_Passes across the stage to foot of staircase_.]     Ah! who art thou    That sittest on the stair, like unto Death    Waiting a guilty soul?  [_A pause_.]    Canst thou not speak?    Or has this storm laid palsy on thy tongue,    And chilled thy utterance?                                [_The figure rises and takes off his mask_.]  MORANZONE     Guido Ferranti,    Thy murdered father laughs for joy to-night.  GUIDO [_confusedly_]     What, art thou here?  MORANZONE     Ay, waiting for your coming.  GUIDO [_looking away from him_]     I did not think to see you, but am glad,    That you may know the thing I mean to do.  MORANZONE     First, I would have you know my well-laid plans;    Listen: I have set horses at the gate    Which leads to Parma: when you have done your business    We will ride hence, and by to-morrow night?  GUIDO     It cannot be.  MORANZONE     Nay, but it shall.  GUIDO     Listen, Lord Moranzone,    I am resolved not to kill this man.  MORANZONE     Surely my ears are traitors, speak again:    It cannot be but age has dulled my powers,    I am an old man now: what did you say?    You said that with that dagger in your belt    You would avenge your father's bloody murder;    Did you not say that?  GUIDO     No, my lord, I said    I was resolved not to kill the Duke.  MORANZONE     You said not that; it is my senses mock me;    Or else this midnight air o?ercharged with storm    Alters your message in the giving it.  GUIDO     Nay, you heard rightly; I?ll not kill this man.  MORANZONE     What of thine oath, thou traitor, what of thine oath?  GUIDO     I am resolved not to keep that oath.  MORANZONE     What of thy murdered father?  GUIDO     Dost thou think    My father would be glad to see me coming,    This old man's blood still hot upon mine hands?  MORANZONE     Ay! he would laugh for joy.  GUIDO     I do not think so,    There is better knowledge in the other world;    Vengeance is God's, let God himself revenge.  MORANZONE     Thou art God's minister of vengeance.  GUIDO     No!    God hath no minister but his own hand.    I will not kill this man.  MORANZONE     Why are you here,    If not to kill him, then?  GUIDO     Lord Moranzone,    I purpose to ascend to the Duke's chamber,    And as he lies asleep lay on his breast    The dagger and this writing; when he awakes    Then he will know who held him in his power    And slew him not: this is the noblest vengeance    Which I can take.  MORANZONE     You will not slay him?  GUIDO     No.  MORANZONE     Ignoble son of a noble father,    Who sufferest this man who sold that father    To live an hour.  GUIDO     ?Twas thou that hindered me;    I would have killed him in the open square,    The day I saw him first.  MORANZONE     It was not yet time;    Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,    Thou pratest of forgiveness.  GUIDO     No! revenge:    The right revenge my father's son should take.  MORANZONE     You are a coward,    Take out the knife, get to the Duke's chamber,    And bring me back his heart upon the blade.    When he is dead, then you can talk to me    Of noble vengeances.  GUIDO     Upon thine honour,    And by the love thou bearest my father's name,    Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman,    That generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord,    Would have crept at night-time, like a common thief,    And stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed,    However he had wronged him: tell me that.  MORANZONE  [after some hesitation]     You have sworn an oath, see that you keep that oath.    Boy, do you think I do not know your secret,    Your traffic with the Duchess?  GUIDO     Silence, liar!    The very moon in heaven is not more chaste.    Nor the white stars so pure.  MORANZONE     And yet, you love her;    Weak fool, to let love in upon your life,    Save as a plaything.  GUIDO     You do well to talk:    Within your veins, old man, the pulse of youth    Throbs with no ardour.  Your eyes full of rheum    Have against Beauty closed their filmy doors,    And your clogged ears, losing their natural sense,    Have shut you from the music of the world.    You talk of love!  You know not what it is.  MORANZONE     Oh, in my time, boy, have I walked i? the moon,    Swore I would live on kisses and on blisses,    Swore I would die for love, and did not die,    Wrote love bad verses; ay, and sung them badly,    Like all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks!    I know the partings and the chamberings;    We are all animals at best, and love    Is merely passion with a holy name.  GUIDO     Now then I know you have not loved at all.    Love is the sacrament of life; it sets    Virtue where virtue was not; cleanses men    Of all the vile pollutions of this world;    It is the fire which purges gold from dross,    It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff,    It is the spring which in some wintry soil    Makes innocence to blossom like a rose.    The days are over when God walked with men,    But Love, which is his image, holds his place.    When a man loves a woman, then he knows    God's secret, and the secret of the world.    There is no house so lowly or so mean,    Which, if their hearts be pure who live in it,    Love will not enter; but if bloody murder    Knock at the Palace gate and is let in,    Love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies.    This is the punishment God sets on sin.    The wicked cannot love.                 [_A groan comes from the_ DUKE?S _chamber_.]     Ah!  What is that?    Do you not hear?  ?Twas nothing.    So I think    That it is woman's mission by their love    To save the souls of men: and loving her,    My Lady, my white Beatrice, I begin    To see a nobler and a holier vengeance    In letting this man live, than doth reside    In bloody deeds o? night, stabs in the dark,    And young hands clutching at a palsied throat.    It was, I think, for love's sake that Lord Christ,    Who was indeed himself incarnate Love,    Bade every man forgive his enemy.  MORANZONE [_sneeringly_]     That was in Palestine, not Padua;    And said for saints: I have to do with men.  GUIDO     It was for all time said.  MORANZONE     And your white Duchess,    What will she do to thank you?  GUIDO     Alas, I will not see her face again.    ?Tis but twelve hours since I parted from her,    So suddenly, and with such violent passion,    That she has shut her heart against me now:    No, I will never see her.  MORANZONE     What will you do?  GUIDO     After that I have laid the dagger there,    Get hence to-night from Padua.  MORANZONE     And then?  GUIDO     I will take service with the Doge at Venice,    And bid him pack me straightway to the wars,    And there I will, being now sick of life,    Throw that poor life against some desperate spear.                                [_A groan from the_ DUKE?S _chamber again_.]     Did you not hear a voice?  MORANZONE     I always hear,    From the dim confines of some sepulchre,    A voice that cries for vengeance.  We waste time,    It will be morning soon; are you resolved    You will not kill the Duke?  GUIDO     I am resolved.  MORANZONE     O wretched father, lying unavenged.  GUIDO     More wretched, were thy son a murderer.  MORANZONE     Why, what is life?  GUIDO     I do not know, my lord,    I did not give it, and I dare not take it.  MORANZONE     I do not thank God often; but I think    I thank him now that I have got no son!    And you, what bastard blood flows in your veins    That when you have your enemy in your grasp    You let him go!  I would that I had left you    With the dull hinds that reared you.  GUIDO     Better perhaps    That you had done so!  May be better still    I?d not been born to this distressful world.  MORANZONE     Farewell!  GUIDO     Farewell!  Some day, Lord Moranzone,    You will understand my vengeance.  MORANZONE     Never, boy.                             [_Gets out of window and exit by rope ladder_.]  GUIDO     Father, I think thou knowest my resolve,    And with this nobler vengeance art content.    Father, I think in letting this man live    That I am doing what thou wouldst have done.    Father, I know not if a human voice    Can pierce the iron gateway of the dead,    Or if the dead are set in ignorance    Of what we do, or do not, for their sakes.    And yet I feel a presence in the air,    There is a shadow standing at my side,    And ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips,    And leave them holier.  [_Kneels down_.]    O father, if ?tis thou,    Canst thou not burst through the decrees of death,    And if corporeal semblance show thyself,    That I may touch thy hand!    No, there is nothing.  [_Rises_.]    ?Tis the night that cheats us with its phantoms,    And, like a puppet-master, makes us think    That things are real which are not.  It grows late.    Now must I to my business.                       [_Pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads it_.]     When he wakes,    And sees this letter, and the dagger with it,    Will he not have some loathing for his life,    Repent, perchance, and lead a better life,    Or will he mock because a young man spared    His natural enemy?  I do not care.    Father, it is thy bidding that I do,    Thy bidding, and the bidding of my love    Which teaches me to know thee as thou art.  [_Ascends staircase stealthily_, _and just as he reaches out his hand to draw back the curtain the Duchess appears all in white_.  GUIDO _starts back_.]  DUCHESS     Guido! what do you here so late?  GUIDO     O white and spotless angel of my life,    Sure thou hast come from Heaven with a message    That mercy is more noble than revenge?  DUCHESS     There is no barrier between us now.  GUIDO     None, love, nor shall be.  DUCHESS     I have seen to that.  GUIDO     Tarry here for me.  DUCHESS     No, you are not going?    You will not leave me as you did before?  GUIDO     I will return within a moment's space,    But first I must repair to the Duke's chamber,    And leave this letter and this dagger there,    That when he wakes?  DUCHESS     When who wakes?  GUIDO     Why, the Duke.  DUCHESS     He will not wake again.  GUIDO     What, is he dead?  DUCHESS     Ay! he is dead.  GUIDO     O God! how wonderful    Are all thy secret ways!  Who would have said    That on this very night, when I had yielded    Into thy hands the vengeance that is thine,    Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,    And bade him come before thy judgment seat.  DUCHESS     I have just killed him.  GUIDO [_in horror_]     Oh!  DUCHESS     He was asleep;    Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.    I had resolved to kill myself to-night.    About an hour ago I waked from sleep,    And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,    Where I had hidden it to serve my need,    And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,    And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,    And turned to fall upon it, when I marked    The old man sleeping, full of years and sin;    There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,    And as I looked upon his evil face    Suddenly like a flame there flashed across me,    There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:    You said there lay a barrier between us,    What barrier but he??    I hardly know    What happened, but a steaming mist of blood    Rose up between us two.  GUIDO     Oh, horrible!  DUCHESS     And then he groaned,    And then he groaned no more!  I only heard    The dripping of the blood upon the floor.  GUIDO     Enough, enough.  DUCHESS     Will you not kiss me now?    Do you remember saying that women's love    Turns men to angels? well, the love of man    Turns women into martyrs; for its sake    We do or suffer anything.  GUIDO     O God!  DUCHESS     Will you not speak?  GUIDO     I cannot speak at all.  DUCHESS     Let as not talk of this!  Let us go hence:    Is not the barrier broken down between us?    What would you more?  Come, it is almost morning.                                               [_Puts her hand on_ GUIDO?S.]  GUIDO [_breaking from her_]     O damned saint!  O angel fresh from Hell!    What bloody devil tempted thee to this!    That thou hast killed thy husband, that is nothing?    Hell was already gaping for his soul?    But thou hast murdered Love, and in its place    Hast set a horrible and bloodstained thing,    Whose very breath breeds pestilence and plague,    And strangles Love.  DUCHESS [_in amazed wonder_]     I did it all for you.    I would not have you do it, had you willed it,    For I would keep you without blot or stain,    A thing unblemished, unassailed, untarnished.    Men do not know what women do for love.    Have I not wrecked my soul for your dear sake,    Here and hereafter?  GUIDO     No, do not touch me,    Between us lies a thin red stream of blood;    I dare not look across it: when you stabbed him    You stabbed Love with a sharp knife to the heart.    We cannot meet again.  DUCHESS [_wringing her hands_]     For you!  For you!    I did it all for you: have you forgotten?    You said there was a barrier between us;    That barrier lies now i? the upper chamber    Upset, overthrown, beaten, and battered down,    And will not part us ever.  GUIDO     No, you mistook:    Sin was the barrier, you have raised it up;    Crime was the barrier, you have set it there.    The barrier was murder, and your hand    Has builded it so high it shuts out heaven,    It shuts out God.  DUCHESS     I did it all for you;    You dare not leave me now: nay, Guido, listen.    Get horses ready, we will fly to-night.    The past is a bad dream, we will forget it:    Before us lies the future: shall we not have    Sweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh??    No, no, we will not laugh, but, when we weep,    Well, we will weep together; I will serve you;    I will be very meek and very gentle:    You do not know me.  GUIDO     Nay, I know you now;    Get hence, I say, out of my sight.  DUCHESS [_pacing up and down_]     O God,    How I have loved this man!  GUIDO     You never loved me.    Had it been so, Love would have stayed your hand.    How could we sit together at Love's table?    You have poured poison in the sacred wine,    And Murder dips his fingers in the sop.  DUCHESS [_throws herself on her knees_]     Then slay me now!  I have spilt blood to-night,    You shall spill more, so we go hand in hand    To heaven or to hell.  Draw your sword, Guido.    Quick, let your soul go chambering in my heart,    It will but find its master's image there.    Nay, if you will not slay me with your sword,    Bid me to fall upon this reeking knife,    And I will do it.  GUIDO [_wresting knife from her_]     Give it to me, I say.    O God, your very hands are wet with blood!    This place is Hell, I cannot tarry here.    I pray you let me see your face no more.  DUCHESS     Better for me I had not seen your face.                    [GUIDO _recoils_: _she seizes his hands as she kneels_.]     Nay, Guido, listen for a while:    Until you came to Padua I lived    Wretched indeed, but with no murderous thought,    Very submissive to a cruel Lord,    Very obedient to unjust commands,    As pure I think as any gentle girl    Who now would turn in horror from my hands?                                                              [_Stands up_.]     You came: ah!  Guido, the first kindly words    I ever heard since I had come from France    Were from your lips: well, well, that is no matter.    You came, and in the passion of your eyes    I read love's meaning; everything you said    Touched my dumb soul to music, so I loved you.    And yet I did not tell you of my love.    ?Twas you who sought me out, knelt at my feet    As I kneel now at yours, and with sweet vows,                                                                 [_Kneels_.]     Whose music seems to linger in my ears,    Swore that you loved me, and I trusted you.    I think there are many women in the world    Who would have tempted you to kill the man.    I did not.    Yet I know that had I done so,    I had not been thus humbled in the dust,                                                              [_Stands up_.]     But you had loved me very faithfully.                                   [_After a pause approaches him timidly_.]     I do not think you understand me, Guido:    It was for your sake that I wrought this deed    Whose horror now chills my young blood to ice,    For your sake only.  [_Stretching out her arm_.]    Will you not speak to me?    Love me a little: in my girlish life    I have been starved for love, and kindliness    Has passed me by.  GUIDO     I dare not look at you:    You come to me with too pronounced a favour;    Get to your tirewomen.  DUCHESS     Ay, there it is!    There speaks the man! yet had you come to me    With any heavy sin upon your soul,    Some murder done for hire, not for love,    Why, I had sat and watched at your bedside    All through the night-time, lest Remorse might come    And pour his poisons in your ear, and so    Keep you from sleeping!  Sure it is the guilty,    Who, being very wretched, need love most.  GUIDO     There is no love where there is any guilt.  DUCHESS     No love where there is any guilt!  O God,    How differently do we love from men!    There is many a woman here in Padua,    Some workman's wife, or ruder artisan's,    Whose husband spends the wages of the week    In a coarse revel, or a tavern brawl,    And reeling home late on the Saturday night,    Finds his wife sitting by a fireless hearth,    Trying to hush the child who cries for hunger,    And then sets to and beats his wife because    The child is hungry, and the fire black.    Yet the wife loves him! and will rise next day    With some red bruise across a careworn face,    And sweep the house, and do the common service,    And try and smile, and only be too glad    If he does not beat her a second time    Before her child!?that is how women love.                                          [_A pause_: GUIDO _says nothing_.]     I think you will not drive me from your side.    Where have I got to go if you reject me??    You for whose sake this hand has murdered life,    You for whose sake my soul has wrecked itself    Beyond all hope of pardon.  GUIDO     Get thee gone:    The dead man is a ghost, and our love too,    Flits like a ghost about its desolate tomb,    And wanders through this charnel house, and weeps    That when you slew your lord you slew it also.    Do you not see?  DUCHESS     I see when men love women    They give them but a little of their lives,    But women when they love give everything;    I see that, Guido, now.  GUIDO     Away, away,    And come not back till you have waked your dead.  DUCHESS     I would to God that I could wake the dead,    Put vision in the glaz?d eves, and give    The tongue its natural utterance, and bid    The heart to beat again: that cannot be:    For what is done, is done: and what is dead    Is dead for ever: the fire cannot warm him:    The winter cannot hurt him with its snows;    Something has gone from him; if you call him now,    He will not answer; if you mock him now,    He will not laugh; and if you stab him now    He will not bleed.    I would that I could wake him!    O God, put back the sun a little space,    And from the roll of time blot out to-night,    And bid it not have been!  Put back the sun,    And make me what I was an hour ago!    No, no, time will not stop for anything,    Nor the sun stay its courses, though Repentance    Calling it back grow hoarse; but you, my love,    Have you no word of pity even for me?    O Guido, Guido, will you not kiss me once?    Drive me not to some desperate resolve:    Women grow mad when they are treated thus:    Will you not kiss me once?  GUIDO [_holding up knife_]     I will not kiss you    Until the blood grows dry upon this knife,    [_Wildly_]  Back to your dead!  DUCHESS [_going up the stairs_]     Why, then I will be gone! and may you find    More mercy than you showed to me to-night!  GUIDO     Let me find mercy when I go at night    And do foul murder.  DUCHESS [_coming down a few steps_.]     Murder did you say?    Murder is hungry, and still cries for more,    And Death, his brother, is not satisfied,    But walks the house, and will not go away,    Unless he has a comrade!  Tarry, Death,    For I will give thee a most faithful lackey    To travel with thee!  Murder, call no more,    For thou shalt eat thy fill.    There is a storm    Will break upon this house before the morning,    So horrible, that the white moon already    Turns grey and sick with terror, the low wind    Goes moaning round the house, and the high stars    Run madly through the vaulted firmament,    As though the night wept tears of liquid fire    For what the day shall look upon.  Oh, weep,    Thou lamentable heaven!  Weep thy fill!    Though sorrow like a cataract drench the fields,    And make the earth one bitter lake of tears,    It would not be enough.  [_A peal of thunder_.]    Do you not hear,    There is artillery in the Heaven to-night.    Vengeance is wakened up, and has unloosed    His dogs upon the world, and in this matter    Which lies between us two, let him who draws    The thunder on his head beware the ruin    Which the forked flame brings after.           [_A flash of lightning followed by a peal of thunder_.]  GUIDO     Away! away!  [_Exit the_ DUCHESS, _who as she lifts the crimson curtain looks back for a moment at_ GUIDO, _but he makes no sign_.  _More thunder_.]     Now is life fallen in ashes at my feet    And noble love self-slain; and in its place    Crept murder with its silent bloody feet.    And she who wrought it?Oh! and yet she loved me,    And for my sake did do this dreadful thing.    I have been cruel to her: Beatrice!    Beatrice, I say, come back.    [_Begins to ascend staircase_, _when the noise of Soldiers is heard_.]     Ah! what is that?    Torches ablaze, and noise of hurrying feet.    Pray God they have not seized her.                                                     [_Noise grows louder_.]     Beatrice!    There is yet time to escape.  Come down, come out!                   [_The voice of the_ DUCHESS _outside_.]     This way went he, the man who slew my lord.  [_Down the staircase comes hurrying a confused body of Soldiers_; GUIDO _is not seen at first_, _till the_ DUCHESS _surrounded by Servants carrying torches appears at the top of the staircase_, _and points to_ GUIDO, _who is seized at once_, _one of the Soldiers dragging the knife from his hand and showing it to the Captain of the Guard in sight of the audience_.  _Tableau_.]  ACT IV                                     SCENE  _The Court of Justice_: _the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet_: _above the hangings the wall is red_, _and gilt symbolical figures bear up the roof_, _which is made of red beams with grey soffits and moulding_: _a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the Duchess_: _below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges_: _below that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each side of the canopy_, _and two soldiers guard the door_; _the citizens have some of them collected in the Court_; _others are coming in greeting one another_; _two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands_.  FIRST CITIZEN     Good morrow, neighbour Anthony.  SECOND CITIZEN     Good morrow, neighbour Dominick.  FIRST CITIZEN     This is a strange day for Padua, is it not??the Duke being dead.  SECOND CITIZEN     I tell you, neighbour Dominick, I have not known such a day since the    last Duke died.  FIRST CITIZEN     They will try him first, and sentence him afterwards, will they not,    neighbour Anthony?  SECOND CITIZEN     Nay, for he might 'scape his punishment then; but they will condemn    him first so that he gets his deserts, and give him trial afterwards    so that no injustice is done.  FIRST CITIZEN     Well, well, it will go hard with him I doubt not.  SECOND CITIZEN     Surely it is a grievous thing to shed a Duke's blood.  THIRD CITIZEN     They say a Duke has blue blood.  SECOND CITIZEN     I think our Duke's blood was black like his soul.  FIRST CITIZEN     Have a watch, neighbour Anthony, the officer is looking at thee.  SECOND CITIZEN     I care not if he does but look at me; he cannot whip me with the    lashes of his eye.  THIRD CITIZEN     What think you of this young man who stuck the knife into the Duke?  SECOND CITIZEN     Why, that he is a well-behaved, and a well-meaning, and a    well-favoured lad, and yet wicked in that he killed the Duke.  THIRD CITIZEN     ?Twas the first time he did it: may be the law will not be hard on    him, as he did not do it before.  SECOND CITIZEN     True.  TIPSTAFF     Silence, knave.  SECOND CITIZEN     Am I thy looking-glass, Master Tipstaff, that thou callest me knave?  FIRST CITIZEN     Here be one of the household coming.  Well, Dame Lucy, thou art of the    Court, how does thy poor mistress the Duchess, with her sweet face?  MISTRESS LUCY     O well-a-day!  O miserable day!  O day!  O misery!  Why it is just    nineteen years last June, at Michaelmas, since I was married to my    husband, and it is August now, and here is the Duke murdered; there is    a coincidence for you!  SECOND CITIZEN     Why, if it is a coincidence, they may not kill the young man: there is    no law against coincidences.  FIRST CITIZEN     But how does the Duchess?  MISTRESS LUCY     Well well, I knew some harm would happen to the house: six weeks ago    the cakes were all burned on one side, and last Saint Martin even as    ever was, there flew into the candle a big moth that had wings, and    a?most scared me.  FIRST CITIZEN     But come to the Duchess, good gossip: what of her?  MISTRESS LUCY     Marry, it is time you should ask after her, poor lady; she is    distraught almost.  Why, she has not slept, but paced the chamber all    night long.  I prayed her to have a posset, or some aqua-vit?, and to    get to bed and sleep a little for her health's sake, but she answered    me she was afraid she might dream.  That was a strange answer, was it    not?  SECOND CITIZEN     These great folk have not much sense, so Providence makes it up to    them in fine clothes.  MISTRESS LUCY     Well, well, God keep murder from us, I say, as long as we are alive.                                       [_Enter_ LORD MORANZONE _hurriedly_.]  MORANZONE     Is the Duke dead?  SECOND CITIZEN     He has a knife in his heart, which they say is not healthy for any    man.  MORANZONE     Who is accused of having killed him?  SECOND CITIZEN     Why, the prisoner, sir.  MORANZONE     But who is the prisoner?  SECOND CITIZEN     Why, he that is accused of the|2
33| Duke's murder.  MORANZONE     I mean, what is his name?  SECOND CITIZEN     Faith, the same which his godfathers gave him: what else should it be?  TIPSTAFF     Guido Ferranti is his name, my lord.  MORANZONE     I almost knew thine answer ere you gave it.                                                                  [_Aside_.]     Yet it is strange he should have killed the Duke,    Seeing he left me in such different mood.    It is most likely when he saw the man,    This devil who had sold his father's life,    That passion from their seat within his heart    Thrust all his boyish theories of love,    And in their place set vengeance; yet I marvel    That he escaped not.                                             [_Turning again to the crowd_.]     How was he taken?  Tell me.  THIRD CITIZEN     Marry, sir, he was taken by the heels.  MORANZONE     But who seized him?  THIRD CITIZEN     Why, those that did lay hold of him.  MORANZONE     How was the alarm given?  THIRD CITIZEN     That I cannot tell you, sir.  MISTRESS LUCY     It was the Duchess herself who pointed him out.  MORANZONE [_aside_]     The Duchess!  There is something strange in this.  MISTRESS LUCY     Ay! And the dagger was in his hand?the Duchess's own dagger.  MORANZONE     What did you say?  MISTRESS LUCY     Why, marry, that it was with the Duchess's dagger that the Duke was    killed.  MORANZONE [_aside_]     There is some mystery about this: I cannot understand it.  SECOND CITIZEN     They be very long a-coming,  FIRST CITIZEN     I warrant they will come soon enough for the prisoner.  TIPSTAFF     Silence in the Court!  FIRST CITIZEN     Thou dost break silence in bidding us keep it, Master Tipstaff.                          [_Enter the_ LORD JUSTICE _and the other Judges_.]  SECOND CITIZEN     Who is he in scarlet?  Is he the headsman?  THIRD CITIZEN     Nay, he is the Lord Justice.                                                  [_Enter_ GUIDO _guarded_.]  SECOND CITIZEN     There be the prisoner surely.  THIRD CITIZEN     He looks honest.  FIRST CITIZEN     That be his villany: knaves nowadays do look so honest that honest    folk are forced to look like knaves so as to be different.                  [_Enter the Headman_, _who takes his stand behind_ GUIDO.]  SECOND CITIZEN     Yon be the headsman then!  O Lord!  Is the axe sharp, think you?  FIRST CITIZEN     Ay! sharper than thy wits are; but the edge is not towards him, mark    you.  SECOND CITIZEN [_scratching his neck_]     I? faith, I like it not so near.  FIRST CITIZEN     Tut, thou need'st not be afraid; they never cut the heads of common    folk: they do but hang us.                                                       [_Trumpets outside_.]  THIRD CITIZEN     What are the trumpets for?  Is the trial over?  FIRST CITIZEN     Nay, ?tis for the Duchess.  [_Enter the_ DUCHESS _in black velvet_; _her train of flowered black velvet is carried by two pages in violet_; _with her is the_ CARDINAL _in scarlet_, _and the gentlemen of the Court in black_; _she takes her seat on the throne above the Judges_, _who rise and take their caps off as she enters_; _the_ CARDINAL _sits next to her a little lower_; _the Courtiers group themselves about the throne_.]  SECOND CITIZEN     O poor lady, how pale she is!  Will she sit there?  FIRST CITIZEN     Ay! she is in the Duke's place now.  SECOND CITIZEN     That is a good thing for Padua; the Duchess is a very kind and    merciful Duchess; why, she cured my child of the ague once.  THIRD CITIZEN     Ay, and has given us bread: do not forget the bread.  A SOLDIER     Stand back, good people.  SECOND CITIZEN     If we be good, why should we stand back?  TIPSTAFF     Silence in the Court!  LORD JUSTICE     May it please your Grace,    Is it your pleasure we proceed to trial    Of the Duke's murder?  [DUCHESS _bows_.]    Set the prisoner forth.    What is thy name?  GUIDO     It matters not, my lord.  LORD JUSTICE     Guido Ferranti is thy name in Padua.  GUIDO     A man may die as well under that name as any other.  LORD JUSTICE     Thou art not ignorant    What dreadful charge men lay against thee here,    Namely, the treacherous murder of thy Lord,    Simone Gesso, Duke of Padua;    What dost thou say in answer?  GUIDO     I say nothing.  LORD JUSTICE [_rising_]     Guido Ferranti?  MORANZONE [_stepping from the crowd_]     Tarry, my Lord Justice.  LORD JUSTICE     Who art thou that bid'st justice tarry, sir?  MORANZONE     So be it justice it can go its way;    But if it be not justice?  LORD JUSTICE     Who is this?  COUNT BARDI     A very noble gentleman, and well known    To the late Duke.  LORD JUSTICE     Sir, thou art come in time    To see the murder of the Duke avenged.    There stands the man who did this heinous thing.  MORANZONE     My lord,    I ask again what proof have ye?  LORD JUSTICE [_holding up the dagger_]     This dagger,    Which from his blood-stained hands, itself all blood,    Last night the soldiers seized: what further proof    Need we indeed?  MORANZONE [_takes the danger and approaches the_ DUCHESS]     Saw I not such a dagger    Hang from your Grace's girdle yesterday?               [_The_ DUCHESS _shudders and makes no answer_.]     Ah! my Lord Justice, may I speak a moment    With this young man, who in such peril stands?  LORD JUSTICE     Ay, willingly, my lord, and may you turn him    To make a full avowal of his guilt.  [LORD MORANZONE _goes over to_ GUIDO, _who stands R. and clutches him by the hand_.]  MORANZONE [_in a low voice_]     She did it!  Nay, I saw it in her eyes.    Boy, dost thou think I?ll let thy father's son    Be by this woman butchered to his death?    Her husband sold your father, and the wife    Would sell the son in turn.  GUIDO     Lord Moranzone,    I alone did this thing: be satisfied,    My father is avenged.  LORD JUSTICE     Doth he confess?  GUIDO     My lord, I do confess    That foul unnatural murder has been done.  FIRST CITIZEN     Why, look at that: he has a pitiful heart, and does not like murder;    they will let him go for that.  LORD JUSTICE     Say you no more?  GUIDO     My lord, I say this also,    That to spill human blood is deadly sin.  SECOND CITIZEN     Marry, he should tell that to the headsman: ?tis a good sentiment.  GUIDO     Lastly, my lord, I do entreat the Court    To give me leave to utter openly    The dreadful secret of this mystery,    And to point out the very guilty one    Who with this dagger last night slew the Duke.  LORD JUSTICE     Thou hast leave to speak.  DUCHESS [_rising_]     I say he shall not speak:    What need have we of further evidence?    Was he not taken in the house at night    In Guilt's own bloody livery?  LORD JUSTICE [_showing her the statute_]     Your Grace    Can read the law.  DUCHESS [_waiving book aside_]     Bethink you, my Lord Justice,    Is it not very like that such a one    May, in the presence of the people here,    Utter some slanderous word against my Lord,    Against the city, or the city's honour,    Perchance against myself.  LORD JUSTICE     My liege, the law.  DUCHESS     He shall not speak, but, with gags in his mouth,    Shall climb the ladder to the bloody block.  LORD JUSTICE     The law, my liege.  DUCHESS     We are not bound by law,    But with it we bind others.  MORANZONE     My Lord Justice,    Thou wilt not suffer this injustice here.  LORD JUSTICE     The Court needs not thy voice, Lord Moranzone.    Madam, it were a precedent most evil    To wrest the law from its appointed course,    For, though the cause be just, yet anarchy    Might on this licence touch these golden scales    And unjust causes unjust victories gain.  COUNT BARDI     I do not think your Grace can stay the law.  DUCHESS     Ay, it is well to preach and prate of law:    Methinks, my haughty lords of Padua,    If ye are hurt in pocket or estate,    So much as makes your monstrous revenues    Less by the value of one ferry toll,    Ye do not wait the tedious law's delay    With such sweet patience as ye counsel me.  COUNT BARDI     Madam, I think you wrong our nobles here.  DUCHESS     I think I wrong them not.  Which of you all    Finding a thief within his house at night,    With some poor chattel thrust into his rags,    Will stop and parley with him? do ye not    Give him unto the officer and his hook    To be dragged gaolwards straightway?    And so now,    Had ye been men, finding this fellow here,    With my Lord's life still hot upon his hands,    Ye would have haled him out into the court,    And struck his head off with an axe.  GUIDO     O God!  DUCHESS     Speak, my Lord Justice.  LORD JUSTICE     Your Grace, it cannot be:    The laws of Padua are most certain here:    And by those laws the common murderer even    May with his own lips plead, and make defence.  DUCHESS     This is no common murderer, Lord Justice,    But a great outlaw, and a most vile traitor,    Taken in open arms against the state.    For he who slays the man who rules a state    Slays the state also, widows every wife,    And makes each child an orphan, and no less    Is to be held a public enemy,    Than if he came with mighty ordonnance,    And all the spears of Venice at his back,    To beat and batter at our city gates?    Nay, is more dangerous to our commonwealth,    For walls and gates, bastions and forts, and things    Whose common elements are wood and stone    May be raised up, but who can raise again    The ruined body of my murdered lord,    And bid it live and laugh?  MAFFIO     Now by Saint Paul    I do not think that they will let him speak.  JEPPO VITELLOZZO     There is much in this, listen.  DUCHESS     Wherefore now,    Throw ashes on the head of Padua,    With sable banners hang each silent street,    Let every man be clad in solemn black;    But ere we turn to these sad rites of mourning    Let us bethink us of the desperate hand    Which wrought and brought this ruin on our state,    And straightway pack him to that narrow house,    Where no voice is, but with a little dust    Death fills right up the lying mouths of men.  GUIDO     Unhand me, knaves!  I tell thee, my Lord Justice,    Thou mightst as well bid the untrammelled ocean,    The winter whirlwind, or the Alpine storm,    Not roar their will, as bid me hold my peace!    Ay! though ye put your knives into my throat,    Each grim and gaping wound shall find a tongue,    And cry against you.  LORD JUSTICE     Sir, this violence    Avails you nothing; for save the tribunal    Give thee a lawful right to open speech,    Naught that thou sayest can be credited.       [_The_ DUCHESS _smiles and_ GUIDO _falls back with a gesture of                                 despair_.]     Madam, myself, and these wise Justices,    Will with your Grace's sanction now retire    Into another chamber, to decide    Upon this difficult matter of the law,    And search the statutes and the precedents.  DUCHESS     Go, my Lord Justice, search the statutes well,    Nor let this brawling traitor have his way.  MORANZONE     Go, my Lord Justice, search thy conscience well,    Nor let a man be sent to death unheard.                                 [_Exit the_ LORD JUSTICE _and the Judges_.]  DUCHESS     Silence, thou evil genius of my life!    Thou com'st between us two a second time;    This time, my lord, I think the turn is mine.  GUIDO     I shall not die till I have uttered voice.  DUCHESS     Thou shalt die silent, and thy secret with thee.  GUIDO     Art thou that Beatrice, Duchess of Padua?  DUCHESS     I am what thou hast made me; look at me well,    I am thy handiwork.  MAFFIO     See, is she not    Like that white tigress which we saw at Venice,    Sent by some Indian soldan to the Doge?  JEPPO     Hush! she may hear thy chatter.  HEADSMAN     My young fellow,    I do not know why thou shouldst care to speak,    Seeing my axe is close upon thy neck,    And words of thine will never blunt its edge.    But if thou art so bent upon it, why    Thou mightest plead unto the Churchman yonder:    The common people call him kindly here,    Indeed I know he has a kindly soul.  GUIDO     This man, whose trade is death, hath courtesies    More than the others.  HEADSMAN     Why, God love you, sir,    I?ll do you your last service on this earth.  GUIDO     My good Lord Cardinal, in a Christian land,    With Lord Christ's face of mercy looking down    From the high seat of Judgment, shall a man    Die unabsolved, unshrived?  And if not so,    May I not tell this dreadful tale of sin,    If any sin there be upon my soul?  DUCHESS     Thou dost but waste thy time.  CARDINAL     Alack, my son,    I have no power with the secular arm.    My task begins when justice has been done,    To urge the wavering sinner to repent    And to confess to Holy Church's ear    The dreadful secrets of a sinful mind.  DUCHESS     Thou mayest speak to the confessional    Until thy lips grow weary of their tale,    But here thou shalt not speak.  GUIDO     My reverend father,    You bring me but cold comfort.  CARDINAL     Nay, my son,    For the great power of our mother Church,    Ends not with this poor bubble of a world,    Of which we are but dust, as Jerome saith,    For if the sinner doth repentant die,    Our prayers and holy masses much avail    To bring the guilty soul from purgatory.  DUCHESS     And when in purgatory thou seest my Lord    With that red star of blood upon his heart,    Tell him I sent thee hither.  GUIDO     O dear God!  MORANZONE     This is the woman, is it, whom you loved?  CARDINAL     Your Grace is very cruel to this man.  DUCHESS     No more than he was cruel to her Grace.  CARDINAL     Yet mercy is the sovereign right of princes.  DUCHESS     I got no mercy, and I give it not.    He hath changed my heart into a heart of stone,    He hath sown rank nettles in a goodly field,    He hath poisoned the wells of pity in my breast,    He hath withered up all kindness at the root;    My life is as some famine murdered land,    Whence all good things have perished utterly:    I am what he hath made me.                                                    [_The_ DUCHESS _weeps_.]  JEPPO     Is it not strange    That she should so have loved the wicked Duke?  MAFFIO     It is most strange when women love their lords,    And when they love them not it is most strange.  JEPPO     What a philosopher thou art, Petrucci!  MAFFIO     Ay!  I can bear the ills of other men,    Which is philosophy.  DUCHESS     They tarry long,    These greybeards and their council; bid them come;    Bid them come quickly, else I think my heart    Will beat itself to bursting: not indeed,    That I here care to live; God knows my life    Is not so full of joy, yet, for all that,    I would not die companionless, or go    Lonely to Hell.    Look, my Lord Cardinal,    Canst thou not see across my forehead here,    In scarlet letters writ, the word Revenge?    Fetch me some water, I will wash it off:    ?Twas branded there last night, but in the day-time    I need not wear it, need I, my Lord Cardinal?    Oh, how it sears and burns into my brain:    Give me a knife; not that one, but another,    And I will cut it out.  CARDINAL     It is most natural    To be incensed against the murderous hand    That treacherously stabbed your sleeping lord.  DUCHESS     I would, old Cardinal, I could burn that hand;    But it will burn hereafter.  CARDINAL     Nay, the Church    Ordains us to forgive our enemies.  DUCHESS     Forgiveness? what is that?  I never got it.    They come at last: well, my Lord Justice, well.                                                 [_Enter the_ LORD JUSTICE.]  LORD JUSTICE     Most gracious Lady, and our sovereign Liege,    We have long pondered on the point at issue,    And much considered of your Grace's wisdom,    And never wisdom spake from fairer lips?  DUCHESS     Proceed, sir, without compliment.  LORD JUSTICE     We find,    As your own Grace did rightly signify,    That any citizen, who by force or craft    Conspires against the person of the Liege,    Is _ipso facto_ outlaw, void of rights    Such as pertain to other citizens,    Is traitor, and a public enemy,    Who may by any casual sword be slain    Without the slayer's danger; nay, if brought    Into the presence of the tribunal,    Must with dumb lips and silence reverent    Listen unto his well-deserved doom,    Nor has the privilege of open speech.  DUCHESS     I thank thee, my Lord Justice, heartily;    I like your law: and now I pray dispatch    This public outlaw to his righteous doom;    What is there more?  LORD JUSTICE     Ay, there is more, your Grace.    This man being alien born, not Paduan,    Nor by allegiance bound unto the Duke,    Save such as common nature doth lay down,    Hath, though accused of treasons manifold,    Whose slightest penalty is certain death,    Yet still the right of public utterance    Before the people and the open court;    Nay, shall be much entreated by the Court,    To make some formal pleading for his life,    Lest his own city, righteously incensed,    Should with an unjust trial tax our state,    And wars spring up against the commonwealth:    So merciful are the laws of Padua    Unto the stranger living in her gates.  DUCHESS     Being of my Lord's household, is he stranger here?  LORD JUSTICE     Ay, until seven years of service spent    He cannot be a Paduan citizen.  GUIDO     I thank thee, my Lord Justice, heartily;    I like your law.  SECOND CITIZEN     I like no law at all:    Were there no law there?d be no law-breakers,    So all men would be virtuous.  FIRST CITIZEN     So they would;    ?Tis a wise saying that, and brings you far.  TIPSTAFF     Ay! to the gallows, knave.  DUCHESS     Is this the law?  LORD JUSTICE     It is the law most certainly, my liege.  DUCHESS     Show me the book: ?tis written in blood-red.  JEPPO     Look at the Duchess.  DUCHESS     Thou accursed law,    I would that I could tear thee from the state    As easy as I tear thee from this book.                                                     [_Tears out the page_.]     Come here, Count Bardi: are you honourable?    Get a horse ready for me at my house,    For I must ride to Venice instantly.  BARDI     To Venice, Madam?  DUCHESS     Not a word of this,    Go, go at once.  [_Exit_ COUNT BARDI.]    A moment, my Lord Justice.    If, as thou sayest it, this is the law?    Nay, nay, I doubt not that thou sayest right,    Though right be wrong in such a case as this?    May I not by the virtue of mine office    Adjourn this court until another day?  LORD JUSTICE     Madam, you cannot stay a trial for blood.  DUCHESS     I will not tarry then to hear this man    Rail with rude tongue against our sacred person.    Come, gentlemen.  LORD JUSTICE     My liege,    You cannot leave this court until the prisoner    Be purged or guilty of this dread offence.  DUCHESS     Cannot, Lord Justice?  By what right do you    Set barriers in my path where I should go?    Am I not Duchess here in Padua,    And the state's regent?  LORD JUSTICE     For that reason, Madam,    Being the fountain-head of life and death    Whence, like a mighty river, justice flows,    Without thy presence justice is dried up    And fails of purpose: thou must tarry here.  DUCHESS     What, wilt thou keep me here against my will?  LORD JUSTICE     We pray thy will be not against the law.  DUCHESS     What if I force my way out of the court?  LORD JUSTICE     Thou canst not force the Court to give thee way.  DUCHESS     I will not tarry.  [_Rises from her seat_.]  LORD JUSTICE     Is the usher here?    Let him stand forth.  [_Usher comes forward_.]    Thou knowest thy business, sir.  [_The Usher closes the doors of the court_, _which are L._, _and when the_ DUCHESS _and her retinue approach_, _kneels down_.]  USHER     In all humility I beseech your Grace    Turn not my duty to discourtesy,    Nor make my unwelcome office an offence.  DUCHESS     Is there no gentleman amongst you all    To prick this prating fellow from our way?  MAFFIO [_drawing his sword_]     Ay! that will I.  LORD JUSTICE     Count Maffio, have a care,    And you, sir.  [_To_ JEPPO.]    The first man who draws his sword    Upon the meanest officer of this Court,    Dies before nightfall.  DUCHESS     Sirs, put up your swords:    It is most meet that I should hear this man.                                                    [_Goes back to throne_.]  MORANZONE     Now hast thou got thy enemy in thy hand.  LORD JUSTICE [_taking the time-glass up_]     Guido Ferranti, while the crumbling sand    Falls through this time-glass, thou hast leave to speak.    This and no more.  GUIDO     It is enough, my lord.  LORD JUSTICE     Thou standest on the extreme verge of death;    See that thou speakest nothing but the truth,    Naught else will serve thee.  GUIDO     If I speak it not,    Then give my body to the headsman there.  LORD JUSTICE [_turns the time-glass_]     Let there be silence while the prisoner speaks.  TIPSTAFF     Silence in the Court there.  GUIDO     My Lords Justices,    And reverent judges of this worthy court,    I hardly know where to begin my tale,    So strangely dreadful is this history.    First, let me tell you of what birth I am.    I am the son of that good Duke Lorenzo    Who was with damned treachery done to death    By a most wicked villain, lately Duke    Of this good town of Padua.  LORD JUSTICE     Have a care,    It will avail thee nought to mock this prince    Who now lies in his coffin.  MAFFIO     By Saint James,    This is the Duke of Parma's rightful heir.  JEPPO     I always thought him noble.  GUIDO     I confess    That with the purport of a just revenge,    A most just vengeance on a man of blood,    I entered the Duke's household, served his will,    Sat at his board, drank of his wine, and was    His intimate: so much I will confess,    And this too, that I waited till he grew    To give the fondest secrets of his life    Into my keeping, till he fawned on me,    And trusted me in every private matter    Even as my noble father trusted him;    That for this thing I waited.                                                        [_To the Headsman_.]     Thou man of blood!    Turn not thine axe on me before the time:    Who knows if it be time for me to die?    Is there no other neck in court but mine?  LORD JUSTICE     The sand within the time-glass flows apace.    Come quickly to the murder of the Duke.  GUIDO     I will be brief: Last night at twelve o? the clock,    By a strong rope I scaled the palace wall,    With purport to revenge my father's murder?    Ay! with that purport I confess, my lord.    This much I will acknowledge, and this also,    That as with stealthy feet I climbed the stair    Which led unto the chamber of the Duke,    And reached my hand out for the scarlet cloth    Which shook and shivered in the gusty door,    Lo! the white moon that sailed in the great heaven    Flooded with silver light the darkened room,    Night lit her candles for me, and I saw    The man I hated, cursing in his sleep;    And thinking of a most dear father murdered,    Sold to the scaffold, bartered to the block,    I smote the treacherous villain to the heart    With this same dagger, which by chance I found    Within the chamber.  DUCHESS [_rising from her seat_]     Oh!  GUIDO [_hurriedly_]     I killed the Duke.    Now, my Lord Justice, if I may crave a boon,    Suffer me not to see another sun    Light up the misery of this loathsome world.  LORD JUSTICE     Thy boon is granted, thou shalt die to-night.    Lead him away.  Come, Madam  [GUIDO _is led off_; _as he goes the_ DUCHESS _stretches out her arms and rushes down the stage_.]  DUCHESS     Guido!  Guido!    ACT V                                     SCENE  _A dungeon in the public prison of Padua_; _Guido lies asleep on a pallet_ (_L.C._); _a table with a goblet on it is set_ (_L.C._); _five soldiers are drinking and playing dice in the corner on a stone table_; _one of them has a lantern hung to his halbert_; _a torch is set in the wall over Guido's head_.  _Two grated windows behind_, _one on each side of the door which is_ (_C._), _look out into the passage_; _the stage is rather dark_.  FIRST SOLDIER [_throws dice_]     Sixes again! good Pietro.  SECOND SOLDIER     I? faith, lieutenant, I will play with thee no more.  I will lose    everything.  THIRD SOLDIER     Except thy wits; thou art safe there!  SECOND SOLDIER     Ay, ay, he cannot take them from me.  THIRD SOLDIER     No; for thou hast no wits to give him.  THE SOLDIERS [_loudly_]     Ha! ha! ha!  FIRST SOLDIER     Silence!  You will wake the prisoner; he is asleep.  SECOND SOLDIER     What matter?  He will get sleep enough when he is buried.  I warrant    he?d be glad if we could wake him when he's in the grave.  THIRD SOLDIER     Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.  SECOND SOLDIER     Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one of    us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes being    near against the law.  FIRST SOLDIER     Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.  SECOND SOLDIER     And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked    people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.  THIRD SOLDIER     Ay, that is true.  How old is the prisoner?  SECOND SOLDIER     Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.  FIRST SOLDIER     Why, then, he might be any age.  SECOND SOLDIER     They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.  FIRST SOLDIER     Is that so?  SECOND SOLDIER     Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.  FIRST SOLDIER     I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent.  SECOND SOLDIER     True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely.  THE SOLDIERS     Ha! ha! ha!  FIRST SOLDIER     I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything.  SECOND SOLDIER     Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see that    justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his head    is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there is no    law against that.  FIRST SOLDIER     I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business    for him after all.  This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the law    can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure.  THIRD SOLDIER     And if he does not drink it?  FIRST SOLDIER     Why, then, they will kill him.                                             [_Knocking comes at the door_.]  FIRST SOLDIER     See who that is.          [_Third Soldier goes over and looks through the wicket_.]  THIRD SOLDIER     It is a woman, sir.  FIRST SOLDIER     Is she pretty?  THIRD SOLDIER     I can?t tell.  She is masked, lieutenant.  FIRST SOLDIER     It is only very ugly or very beautiful women who ever hide their    faces.  Let her in.       [_Soldier opens the door_, _and the_ DUCHESS _masked and cloaked                                 enters_.]  DUCHESS [_to Third Soldier_]     Are you the officer on guard?  FIRST SOLDIER [_coming forward_]     I am, madam.  DUCHESS     I must see the prisoner alone.  FIRST SOLDIER     I am afraid that is impossible.  [_The_ DUCHESS _hands him a ring_,    _he looks at and returns it to her with a bow and makes a sign to the    Soldiers_.]  Stand without there.                                                    [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.]  DUCHESS     Officer, your men are somewhat rough.  FIRST SOLDIER     They mean no harm.  DUCHESS     I shall be going back in a few minutes.  As I pass through the    corridor do not let them try and lift my mask.  FIRST SOLDIER     You need not be afraid, madam.  DUCHESS     I have a particular reason for wishing my face not to be seen.  FIRST SOLDIER     Madam, with this ring you can go in and out as you please; it is the    Duchess's own ring.  DUCHESS     Leave us.  [_The Soldier turns to go out_.]  A moment, sir.  For what    hour is . . .  FIRST SOLDIER     At twelve o?clock, madam, we have orders to lead him out; but I dare    say he won?t wait for us; he's more like to take a drink out of that    poison yonder.  Men are afraid of the headsman.  DUCHESS     Is that poison?  FIRST SOLDIER     Ay, madam, and very sure poison too.  DUCHESS     You may go, sir.  FIRST SOLDIER     By Saint James, a pretty hand!  I wonder who she is.  Some woman who    loved him, perhaps.                                                                   [_Exit_.]  DUCHESS [_taking|2
34| her mark off_]     At last!    He can escape now in this cloak and vizard,    We are of a height almost: they will not know him;    As for myself what matter?    So that he does not curse me as he goes,    I care but little: I wonder will he curse me.    He has the right.  It is eleven now;    They will not come till twelve.                                                 [_Goes over to the table_.]     So this is poison.    Is it not strange that in this liquor here    There lies the key to all philosophies?                                                       [_Takes the cup up_.]     It smells of poppies.  I remember well    That, when I was a child in Sicily,    I took the scarlet poppies from the corn,    And made a little wreath, and my grave uncle,    Don John of Naples, laughed: I did not know    That they had power to stay the springs of life,    To make the pulse cease beating, and to chill    The blood in its own vessels, till men come    And with a hook hale the poor body out,    And throw it in a ditch: the body, ay,?    What of the soul? that goes to heaven or hell.    Where will mine go?        [_Takes the torch from the wall_, _and goes over to the bed_.]     How peacefully here he sleeps,    Like a young schoolboy tired out with play:    I would that I could sleep so peacefully,    But I have dreams.  [_Bending over him_.]    Poor boy: what if I kissed him?    No, no, my lips would burn him like a fire.    He has had enough of Love.  Still that white neck    Will 'scape the headsman: I have seen to that:    He will get hence from Padua to-night,    And that is well.  You are very wise, Lord Justices,    And yet you are not half so wise as I am,    And that is well.    O God! how I have loved you,    And what a bloody flower did Love bear!                                                [_Comes back to the table_.]     What if I drank these juices, and so ceased?    Were it not better than to wait till Death    Come to my bed with all his serving men,    Remorse, disease, old age, and misery?    I wonder does one suffer much: I think    That I am very young to die like this,    But so it must be.  Why, why should I die?    He will escape to-night, and so his blood    Will not be on my head.  No, I must die;    I have been guilty, therefore I must die;    He loves me not, and therefore I must die:    I would die happier if he would kiss me,    But he will not do that.  I did not know him.    I thought he meant to sell me to the Judge;    That is not strange; we women never know    Our lovers till they leave us.                                                    [_Bell begins to toll_.]     Thou vile bell,    That like a bloodhound from thy brazen throat    Call'st for this man's life, cease! thou shalt not get it.    He stirs?I must be quick:  [_Takes up cup_.]    O Love, Love, Love,    I did not think that I would pledge thee thus!  [_Drinks poison_, _and sets the cup down on the table behind her_: _the noise wakens_ GUIDO, _who starts up_, _and does not see what she has done_.  _There is silence for a minute_, _each looking at the other_.]     I do not come to ask your pardon now,    Seeing I know I stand beyond all pardon;    Enough of that: I have already, sir,    Confessed my sin to the Lords Justices;    They would not listen to me: and some said    I did invent a tale to save your life;    You have trafficked with me; others said    That women played with pity as with men;    Others that grief for my slain Lord and husband    Had robbed me of my wits: they would not hear me,    And, when I sware it on the holy book,    They bade the doctor cure me.  They are ten,    Ten against one, and they possess your life.    They call me Duchess here in Padua.    I do not know, sir; if I be the Duchess,    I wrote your pardon, and they would not take it;    They call it treason, say I taught them that;    Maybe I did.  Within an hour, Guido,    They will be here, and drag you from the cell,    And bind your hands behind your back, and bid you    Kneel at the block: I am before them there;    Here is the signet ring of Padua,    ?Twill bring you safely through the men on guard;    There is my cloak and vizard; they have orders    Not to be curious: when you pass the gate    Turn to the left, and at the second bridge    You will find horses waiting: by to-morrow    You will be at Venice, safe.  [_A pause_.]    Do you not speak?    Will you not even curse me ere you go??    You have the right.  [_A pause_.]    You do not understand    There lies between you and the headsman's axe    Hardly so much sand in the hour-glass    As a child's palm could carry: here is the ring:    I have washed my hand: there is no blood upon it:    You need not fear.  Will you not take the ring?  GUIDO [_takes ring and kisses it_]     Ay! gladly, Madam.  DUCHESS     And leave Padua.  GUIDO     Leave Padua.  DUCHESS     But it must be to-night.  GUIDO     To-night it shall be.  DUCHESS     Oh, thank God for that!  GUIDO     So I can live; life never seemed so sweet    As at this moment.  DUCHESS     Do not tarry, Guido,    There is my cloak: the horse is at the bridge,    The second bridge below the ferry house:    Why do you tarry?  Can your ears not hear    This dreadful bell, whose every ringing stroke    Robs one brief minute from your boyish life.    Go quickly.  GUIDO     Ay! he will come soon enough.  DUCHESS     Who?  GUIDO [_calmly_]     Why, the headsman.  DUCHESS     No, no.  GUIDO     Only he    Can bring me out of Padua.  DUCHESS     You dare not!    You dare not burden my o?erburdened soul    With two dead men!  I think one is enough.    For when I stand before God, face to face,    I would not have you, with a scarlet thread    Around your white throat, coming up behind    To say I did it.  GUIDO     Madam, I wait.  DUCHESS     No, no, you cannot: you do not understand,    I have less power in Padua to-night    Than any common woman; they will kill you.    I saw the scaffold as I crossed the square,    Already the low rabble throng about it    With fearful jests, and horrid merriment,    As though it were a morris-dancer's platform,    And not Death's sable throne.  O Guido, Guido,    You must escape!  GUIDO     Madam, I tarry here.  DUCHESS     Guido, you shall not: it would be a thing    So terrible that the amazed stars    Would fall from heaven, and the palsied moon    Be in her sphere eclipsed, and the great sun    Refuse to shine upon the unjust earth    Which saw thee die.  GUIDO     Be sure I shall not stir.  DUCHESS [_wringing her hands_]     Is one sin not enough, but must it breed    A second sin more horrible again    Than was the one that bare it?  O God, God,    Seal up sin's teeming womb, and make it barren,    I will not have more blood upon my hand    Than I have now.  GUIDO [_seizing her hand_]     What! am I fallen so low    That I may not have leave to die for you?  DUCHESS [_tearing her hand away_]     Die for me??no, my life is a vile thing,    Thrown to the miry highways of this world;    You shall not die for me, you shall not, Guido;    I am a guilty woman.  GUIDO     Guilty??let those    Who know what a thing temptation is,    Let those who have not walked as we have done,    In the red fire of passion, those whose lives    Are dull and colourless, in a word let those,    If any such there be, who have not loved,    Cast stones against you.  As for me?  DUCHESS     Alas!  GUIDO [_falling at her feet_]     You are my lady, and you are my love!    O hair of gold, O crimson lips, O face    Made for the luring and the love of man!    Incarnate image of pure loveliness!    Worshipping thee I do forget the past,    Worshipping thee my soul comes close to thine,    Worshipping thee I seem to be a god,    And though they give my body to the block,    Yet is my love eternal!      [DUCHESS _puts her hands over her face_: GUIDO _draws them down_.]     Sweet, lift up    The trailing curtains that overhang your eyes    That I may look into those eyes, and tell you    I love you, never more than now when Death    Thrusts his cold lips between us: Beatrice,    I love you: have you no word left to say?    Oh, I can bear the executioner,    But not this silence: will you not say you love me?    Speak but that word and Death shall lose his sting,    But speak it not, and fifty thousand deaths    Are, in comparison, mercy.  Oh, you are cruel,    And do not love me.  DUCHESS     Alas!  I have no right    For I have stained the innocent hands of love    With spilt-out blood: there is blood on the ground;    I set it there.  GUIDO     Sweet, it was not yourself,    It was some devil tempted you.  DUCHESS [_rising suddenly_]     No, no,    We are each our own devil, and we make    This world our hell.  GUIDO     Then let high Paradise    Fall into Tartarus! for I shall make    This world my heaven for a little space.    The sin was mine, if any sin there was.    ?Twas I who nurtured murder in my heart,    Sweetened my meats, seasoned my wine with it,    And in my fancy slew the accursed Duke    A hundred times a day.  Why, had this man    Died half so often as I wished him to,    Death had been stalking ever through the house,    And murder had not slept.    But you, fond heart,    Whose little eyes grew tender over a whipt hound,    You whom the little children laughed to see    Because you brought the sunlight where you passed,    You the white angel of God's purity,    This which men call your sin, what was it?  DUCHESS     Ay!    What was it?  There are times it seems a dream,    An evil dream sent by an evil god,    And then I see the dead face in the coffin    And know it is no dream, but that my hand    Is red with blood, and that my desperate soul    Striving to find some haven for its love    From the wild tempest of this raging world,    Has wrecked its bark upon the rocks of sin.    What was it, said you??murder merely?  Nothing    But murder, horrible murder.  GUIDO     Nay, nay, nay,    ?Twas but the passion-flower of your love    That in one moment leapt to terrible life,    And in one moment bare this gory fruit,    Which I had plucked in thought a thousand times.    My soul was murderous, but my hand refused;    Your hand wrought murder, but your soul was pure.    And so I love you, Beatrice, and let him    Who has no mercy for your stricken head,    Lack mercy up in heaven!  Kiss me, sweet.                                                      [_Tries to kiss her_.]  DUCHESS     No, no, your lips are pure, and mine are soiled,    For Guilt has been my paramour, and Sin    Lain in my bed: O Guido, if you love me    Get hence, for every moment is a worm    Which gnaws your life away: nay, sweet, get hence,    And if in after time you think of me,    Think of me as of one who loved you more    Than anything on earth; think of me, Guido,    As of a woman merely, one who tried    To make her life a sacrifice to love,    And slew love in the trial: Oh, what is that?    The bell has stopped from ringing, and I hear    The feet of armed men upon the stair.  GUIDO [_aside_]     That is the signal for the guard to come.  DUCHESS     Why has the bell stopped ringing?  GUIDO     If you must know,    That stops my life on this side of the grave,    But on the other we shall meet again.  DUCHESS     No, no, ?tis not too late: you must get hence;    The horse is by the bridge, there is still time.    Away, away, you must not tarry here!                                       [_Noise of Soldiers in the passage_.]  A VOICE OUTSIDE     Room for the Lord Justice of Padua!  [_The_ LORD JUSTICE _is seen through the grated window passing down the corridor preceded by men bearing torches_.]  DUCHESS     It is too late.  A VOICE OUTSIDE     Room for the headsman.  DUCHESS [_sinks down_]     Oh!  [_The Headsman with his axe on his shoulder is seen passing the corridor_, _followed by Monks bearing candles_.]  GUIDO     Farewell, dear love, for I must drink this poison.    I do not fear the headsman, but I would die    Not on the lonely scaffold.    But here,    Here in thine arms, kissing thy mouth: farewell!                              [_Goes to the table and takes the goblet up_.]     What, art thou empty?                                                [_Throws it to the ground_.]     O thou churlish gaoler,    Even of poisons niggard!  DUCHESS [_faintly_]     Blame him not.  GUIDO     O God! you have not drunk it, Beatrice?    Tell me you have not?  DUCHESS     Were I to deny it,    There is a fire eating at my heart    Which would find utterance.  GUIDO     O treacherous love,    Why have you not left a drop for me?  DUCHESS     No, no, it held but death enough for one.  GUIDO     Is there no poison still upon your lips,    That I may draw it from them?  DUCHESS     Why should you die?    You have not spilt blood, and so need not die:    I have spilt blood, and therefore I must die.    Was it not said blood should be spilt for blood?    Who said that?  I forget.  GUIDO     Tarry for me,    Our souls will go together.  DUCHESS     Nay, you must live.    There are many other women in the world    Who will love you, and not murder for your sake.  GUIDO     I love you only.  DUCHESS     You need not die for that.  GUIDO     Ah, if we die together, love, why then    Can we not lie together in one grave?  DUCHESS     A grave is but a narrow wedding-bed.  GUIDO     It is enough for us  DUCHESS     And they will strew it    With a stark winding-sheet, and bitter herbs:    I think there are no roses in the grave,    Or if there are, they all are withered now    Since my Lord went there.  GUIDO     Ah! dear Beatrice,    Your lips are roses that death cannot wither.  DUCHESS     Nay, if we lie together, will not my lips    Fall into dust, and your enamoured eyes    Shrivel to sightless sockets, and the worms,    Which are our groomsmen, eat away your heart?  GUIDO     I do not care: Death has no power on love.    And so by Love's immortal sovereignty    I will die with you.  DUCHESS     But the grave is black,    And the pit black, so I must go before    To light the candles for your coming hither.    No, no, I will not die, I will not die.    Love, you are strong, and young, and very brave;    Stand between me and the angel of death,    And wrestle with him for me.      [_Thrusts_ GUIDO _in front of her with his back to the audience_.]     I will kiss you,    When you have thrown him.  Oh, have you no cordial,    To stay the workings of this poison in me?    Are there no rivers left in Italy    That you will not fetch me one cup of water    To quench this fire?  GUIDO     O God!  DUCHESS     You did not tell me    There was a drought in Italy, and no water:    Nothing but fire.  GUIDO     O Love!  DUCHESS     Send for a leech,    Not him who stanched my husband, but another    We have no time: send for a leech, I say:    There is an antidote against each poison,    And he will sell it if we give him money.    Tell him that I will give him Padua,    For one short hour of life: I will not die.    Oh, I am sick to death; no, do not touch me,    This poison gnaws my heart: I did not know    It was such pain to die: I thought that life    Had taken all the agonies to itself;    It seems it is not so.  GUIDO     O damn?d stars    Quench your vile cresset-lights in tears, and bid    The moon, your mistress, shine no more to-night.  DUCHESS     Guido, why are we here?  I think this room    Is poorly furnished for a marriage chamber.    Let us get hence at once.  Where are the horses?    We should be on our way to Venice now.    How cold the night is!  We must ride faster.                                       [_The Monks begin to chant outside_.]     Music!  It should be merrier; but grief    Is of the fashion now?I know not why.    You must not weep: do we not love each other??    That is enough.  Death, what do you here?    You were not bidden to this table, sir;    Away, we have no need of you: I tell you    It was in wine I pledged you, not in poison.    They lied who told you that I drank your poison.    It was spilt upon the ground, like my Lord's blood;    You came too late.  GUIDO     Sweet, there is nothing there:    These things are only unreal shadows.  DUCHESS     Death,    Why do you tarry, get to the upper chamber;    The cold meats of my husband's funeral feast    Are set for you; this is a wedding feast.    You are out of place, sir; and, besides, ?tis summer.    We do not need these heavy fires now,    You scorch us.    Oh, I am burned up,    Can you do nothing?  Water, give me water,    Or else more poison.  No: I feel no pain?    Is it not curious I should feel no pain??    And Death has gone away, I am glad of that.    I thought he meant to part us.  Tell me, Guido,    Are you not sorry that you ever saw me?  GUIDO     I swear I would not have lived otherwise.    Why, in this dull and common world of ours    Men have died looking for such moments as this    And have not found them.  DUCHESS     Then you are not sorry?    How strange that seems.  GUIDO     What, Beatrice, have I not    Stood face to face with beauty?  That is enough    For one man's life.  Why, love, I could be merry;    I have been often sadder at a feast,    But who were sad at such a feast as this    When Love and Death are both our cup-bearers?    We love and die together.  DUCHESS     Oh, I have been    Guilty beyond all women, and indeed    Beyond all women punished.  Do you think?    No, that could not be?Oh, do you think that love    Can wipe the bloody stain from off my hands,    Pour balm into my wounds, heal up my hurts,    And wash my scarlet sins as white as snow??    For I have sinned.  GUIDO     They do not sin at all    Who sin for love.  DUCHESS     No, I have sinned, and yet    Perchance my sin will be forgiven me.    I have loved much  [_They kiss each other now for the first time in this Act_, _when suddenly the_ DUCHESS _leaps up in the dreadful spasm of death_, _tears in agony at her dress_, _and finally_, _with face twisted and distorted with pain_, _falls back dead in a chair_.  GUIDO _seizing her dagger from her belt_, _kills himself_; _and_, _as he falls across her knees_, _clutches at the cloak which is on the back of the chair_, _and throws it entirely over her_.  _There is a little pause_.  _Then down the passage comes the tramp of Soldiers_; _the door is opened_, _and the_ LORD JUSTICE, _the Headsman_, _and the Guard enter and see this figure shrouded in black_, _and_ GUIDO _lying dead across her_.  _The_ LORD JUSTICE _rushes forward and drags the cloak off the_ DUCHESS, _whose face is now the marble image of peace_, _the sign of God's forgiveness_.]   FIRST ACT   SCENE   Morning-room in Algernon's flat in Half-Moon Street.  The room is luxuriously and artistically furnished.  The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining room.  [Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has ceased, Algernon enters.]  Algernon.  Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?  Lane.  I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.  Algernon.  I'm sorry for that, for your sake.  I don't play accurately--any one can play accurately--but I play with wonderful expression.  As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  I keep science for Life.  Lane.  Yes, sir.  Algernon.  And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?  Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Hands them on a salver.]  Algernon.  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.  Lane.  Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.  Algernon.  Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?  I ask merely for information.  Lane.  I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.  I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.  Algernon.  Good heavens!  Is marriage so demoralising as that?  Lane.  I believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir.  I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.  I have only been married once.  That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.  Algernon.  [Languidly_._]  I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.  Lane.  No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.  I never think of it myself.  Algernon.  Very natural, I am sure.  That will do, Lane, thank you.  Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Lane goes out.]  Algernon.  Lane's views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?  They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.  [Enter Lane.]  Lane.  Mr. Ernest Worthing.  [Enter Jack.]  [Lane goes out_._]  Algernon.  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?  Jack.  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy!  Algernon.  [Stiffly_._]  I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?  Jack.  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the country.  Algernon.  What on earth do you do there?  Jack.  [Pulling off his gloves_._]  When one is in town one amuses oneself.  When one is in the country one amuses other people.  It is excessively boring.  Algernon.  And who are the people you amuse?  Jack.  [Airily_._]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours.  Algernon.  Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?  Jack.  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one of them.  Algernon.  How immensely you must amuse them!  [Goes over and takes sandwich.]  By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?  Jack.  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Why cucumber sandwiches?  Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?  Who is coming to tea?  Algernon.  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.  Jack.  How perfectly delightful!  Algernon.  Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here.  Jack.  May I ask why?  Algernon.  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.  It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.  Jack.  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.  Algernon.  I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.  Jack.  How utterly unromantic you are!  Algernon.  I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.  Jack.  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.  The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.  Algernon.  Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.  Divorces are made in Heaven--[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich.  Algernon at once interferes.]  Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.  They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.  [Takes one and eats it.]  Jack.  Well, you have been eating them all the time.  Algernon.  That is quite a different matter.  She is my aunt.  [Takes plate from below.]  Have some bread and butter.  The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.  Jack.  [Advancing to table and helping himself.]  And very good bread and butter it is too.  Algernon.  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.  You behave as if you were married to her already.  You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.  Jack.  Why on earth do you say that?  Algernon.  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.  Girls don't think it right.  Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!  Algernon.  It isn't.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.  In the second place, I don't give my consent.  Jack.  Your consent!  Algernon.  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.  And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.  [Rings bell.]  Jack.  Cecily!  What on earth do you mean?  What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!  I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.  [Enter Lane.]  Algernon.  Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking- room the last time he dined here.  Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]  Jack.  Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I wish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large reward.  Algernon.  Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than usually hard up.  Jack.  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.  [Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  Algernon takes it at once.  Lane goes out.]  Algernon.  I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens case and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.  Jack.  Of course it's mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.  Algernon.  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn't.  More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.  Jack.  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture.  It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private.  I simply want my cigarette case back.  Algernon.  Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.  This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any one of that name.  Jack.  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.  Algernon.  Your aunt!  Jack.  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy.  Algernon.  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]  'From little Cecily with her fondest love.'  Jack.  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows Algernon round the room.]  Algernon.  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  'From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'  There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out.  Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest.  Jack.  It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.  Algernon.  You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as if your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest.  It's on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from case.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'  I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his pocket.]  Jack.  Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.  Algernon.  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.  Jack.  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.  It produces a false impression.  Algernon.  Well, that is exactly what dentists always d|2
35|o.  Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.  Jack.  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?  Algernon.  I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.  Jack.  Well, produce my cigarette case first.  Algernon.  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]  Jack.  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.  In fact it's perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.  Algernon.  Where is that place in the country, by the way?  Jack.  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.  Algernon.  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?  Jack.  My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.  It's one's duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.  Algernon.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!  Jack.  That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.  Algernon.  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don't try it.  You should leave that to people who haven't been at a University.  They do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.  Jack.  What on earth do you mean?  Algernon.  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to- night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.  Jack.  I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.  Algernon.  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.  It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.  Jack.  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.  Algernon.  I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.  To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one's own relations.  In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.  Jack.  I'm not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I'll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going to get rid of Ernest.  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.  Algernon.  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.  Jack.  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won't want to know Bunbury.  Algernon.  Then your wife will.  You don't seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.  Jack.  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.  Algernon.  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.  Jack.  For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical.  It's perfectly easy to be cynical.  Algernon.  My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.  There's such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?  Jack.  I suppose so, if you want to.  Algernon.  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.  [Enter Lane.]  Lane.  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.  [Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen.]  Lady Bracknell.  Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.  Algernon.  I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  That's not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things rarely go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]  Algernon.  [To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!  Gwendolen.  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?  Jack.  You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.  Gwendolen.  Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen and Jack sit down together in the corner.]  Lady Bracknell.  I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn't been there since her poor husband's death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.  And now I'll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.  Algernon.  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]  Lady Bracknell.  Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?  Gwendolen.  Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.  Algernon.  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.  Lane.  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.  Algernon.  No cucumbers!  Lane.  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.  Algernon.  That will do, Lane, thank you.  Lane.  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]  Algernon.  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.  Lady Bracknell.  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.  Algernon.  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.  Lady Bracknell.  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you. I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It's delightful to watch them.  Algernon.  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.  Lady Bracknell.  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.  Algernon.  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with Jack.]  They seem to think I should be with him.  Lady Bracknell.  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.  Algernon.  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.  Lady Bracknell.  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of life.  I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.  Algernon.  I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday.  Of course the music is a great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music, people don't listen, and if one plays bad music people don't talk.  But I'll run over the programme I've drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.  Lady Bracknell.  Thank you, Algernon.  It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and following Algernon.]  I'm sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possibly allow.  People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will accompany me.  Gwendolen.  Certainly, mamma.  [Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains behind.]  Jack.  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.  Gwendolen.  Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.  And that makes me so nervous.  Jack.  I do mean something else.  Gwendolen.  I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.  Jack.  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence . . .  Gwendolen.  I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.  Jack.  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.  Gwendolen.  Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.  There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.  The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.  Jack.  You really love me, Gwendolen?  Gwendolen.  Passionately!  Jack.  Darling!  You don't know how happy you've made me.  Gwendolen.  My own Ernest!  Jack.  But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?  Gwendolen.  But your name is Ernest.  Jack.  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?  Gwendolen.  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.  Jack.  Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care about the name of Ernest . . . I don't think the name suits me at all.  Gwendolen.  It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a music of its own.  It produces vibrations.  Jack.  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.  Gwendolen.  Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!  And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.  She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment's solitude.  The only really safe name is Ernest.  Jack.  Gwendolen, I must get christened at once--I mean we must get married at once.  There is no time to be lost.  Gwendolen.  Married, Mr. Worthing?  Jack.  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.  Gwendolen.  I adore you.  But you haven't proposed to me yet.  Nothing has been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even been touched on.  Jack.  Well . . . may I propose to you now?  Gwendolen.  I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.  Jack.  Gwendolen!  Gwendolen.  Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?  Jack.  You know what I have got to say to you.  Gwendolen.  Yes, but you don't say it.  Jack.  Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]  Gwendolen.  Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it! I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.  Jack.  My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.  Gwendolen.  Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother Gerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.  [Enter Lady Bracknell.]  Lady Bracknell.  Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.  It is most indecorous.  Gwendolen.  Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg you to retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.  Lady Bracknell.  Finished what, may I ask?  Gwendolen.  I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]  Lady Bracknell.  Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.  Gwendolen.  [Reproachfully.]  Mamma!  Lady Bracknell.  In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the door.  She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell's back.  Lady Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!  Gwendolen.  Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]  Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.  [Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]  Jack.  Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.  Lady Bracknell.  [Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together, in fact.  However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?  Jack.  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.  Lady Bracknell.  I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an occupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as it is.  How old are you?  Jack.  Twenty-nine.  Lady Bracknell.  A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.  Which do you know?  Jack.  [After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bracknell.  I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?  Jack.  Between seven and eight thousand a year.  Lady Bracknell.  [Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?  Jack.  In investments, chiefly.  Lady Bracknell.  That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected of one during one's lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one's death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.  That's all that can be said about land.  Jack.  I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don't depend on that for my real income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it.  Lady Bracknell.  A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in the country.  Jack.  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months' notice.  Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bloxham?  I don't know her.  Jack.  Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably advanced in years.  Lady Bracknell.  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character.  What number in Belgrave Square?  Jack.  149.  Lady Bracknell.  [Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought there was something.  However, that could easily be altered.  Jack.  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?  Lady Bracknell.  [Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your politics?  Jack.  Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.  Lady Bracknell.  Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come in the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents living?  Jack.  I have lost both my parents.  Lady Bracknell.  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father? He was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?  Jack.  I am afraid I really don't know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me . . . I don't actually know who I am by birth.  I was . . . well, I was found.  Lady Bracknell.  Found!  Jack.  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.  Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside resort.  Lady Bracknell.  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?  Jack.  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.  Lady Bracknell.  A hand-bag?  Jack.  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag--a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it--an ordinary hand-bag in fact.  Lady Bracknell.  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?  Jack.  In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in mistake for his own.  Lady Bracknell.  The cloak-room at Victoria Station?  Jack.  Yes.  The Brighton line.  Lady Bracknell.  The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion--has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now--but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.  Jack.  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.  Lady Bracknell.  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.  Jack.  Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bracknell.  Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter--a girl brought up with the utmost care--to marry into a cloak- room, and form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!  [Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]  Jack.  Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding March.  Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  For goodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.  How idiotic you are!  [The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]  Algernon.  Didn't it go off all right, old boy?  You don't mean to say Gwendolen refused you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is always refusing people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.  Jack.  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.  Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Never met such a Gorgon . . . I don't really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt in that way before you.  Algernon.  My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.  Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense!  Algernon.  It isn't!  Jack.  Well, I won't argue about the matter.  You always want to argue about things.  Algernon.  That is exactly what things were originally made for.  Jack.  Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?  Algernon.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy. No man does.  That's his.  Jack.  Is that clever?  Algernon.  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.  Jack.  I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays. You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.  Algernon.  We have.  Jack.  I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?  Algernon.  The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.  Jack.  What fools!  Algernon.  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?  Jack.  [In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!  Algernon.  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.  Jack.  Oh, that is nonsense.  Algernon.  What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?  Jack.  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I'll say he died in Paris of apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, don't they?  Algernon.  Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow.  It's a sort of thing that runs in families.  You had much better say a severe chill.  Jack.  You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that kind?  Algernon.  Of course it isn't!  Jack.  Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in Paris, by a severe chill.  That gets rid of him.  Algernon.  But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much interested in your poor brother Ernest?  Won't she feel his loss a good deal?  Jack.  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.  She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.  Algernon.  I would rather like to see Cecily.  Jack.  I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.  Algernon.  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen?  Jack.  Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people.  Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.  I'll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.  Algernon.  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.  Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's, we really must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?  Jack.  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.  Algernon.  Well, I'm hungry.  Jack.  I never knew you when you weren't . . .  Algernon.  What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?  Jack.  Oh no!  I loathe listening.  Algernon.  Well, let us go to the Club?  Jack.  Oh, no!  I hate talking.  Algernon.  Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?  Jack.  Oh, no!  I can't bear looking at things.  It is so silly.  Algernon.  Well, what shall we do?  Jack.  Nothing!  Algernon.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don't mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.  [Enter Lane.]  Lane.  Miss Fairfax.  [Enter Gwendolen.  Lane goes out.]  Algernon.  Gwendolen, upon my word!  Gwendolen.  Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.  Algernon.  Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.  Gwendolen.  Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.  You are not quite old enough to do that.  [Algernon retires to the fir|2
36|eplace.]  Jack.  My own darling!  Gwendolen.  Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression on mamma's face I fear we never shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.  But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.  Jack.  Dear Gwendolen!  Gwendolen.  The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature.  Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.  The simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.  Your town address at the Albany I have.  What is your address in the country?  Jack.  The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.  [Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and writes the address on his shirt-cuff.  Then picks up the Railway Guide.]  Gwendolen.  There is a good postal service, I suppose?  It may be necessary to do something desperate.  That of course will require serious consideration.  I will communicate with you daily.  Jack.  My own one!  Gwendolen.  How long do you remain in town?  Jack.  Till Monday.  Gwendolen.  Good!  Algy, you may turn round now.  Algernon.  Thanks, I've turned round already.  Gwendolen.  You may also ring the bell.  Jack.  You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?  Gwendolen.  Certainly.  Jack.  [To Lane, who now enters.]  I will see Miss Fairfax out.  Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]  [Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon.  It is to be surmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the envelopes, tears them up.]  Algernon.  A glass of sherry, Lane.  Lane.  Yes, sir.  Algernon.  To-morrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.  Lane.  Yes, sir.  Algernon.  I shall probably not be back till Monday.  You can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .  Lane.  Yes, sir.  [Handing sherry.]  Algernon.  I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.  Lane.  It never is, sir.  Algernon.  Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.  Lane.  I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.  [Enter Jack.  Lane goes off.]  Jack.  There's a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for in my life.  [Algernon is laughing immoderately.]  What on earth are you so amused at?  Algernon.  Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.  Jack.  If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious scrape some day.  Algernon.  I love scrapes.  They are the only things that are never serious.  Jack.  Oh, that's nonsense, Algy.  You never talk anything but nonsense.  Algernon.  Nobody ever does.  [Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room.  Algernon lights a cigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]   SECOND ACT   SCENE   Garden at the Manor House.  A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house.  The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses.  Time of year, July.  Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree.  [Miss Prism discovered seated at the table.  Cecily is at the back watering flowers.]  Miss Prism.  [Calling.]  Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  We will repeat yesterday's lesson.  Cecily.  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I don't like German.  It isn't at all a becoming language.  I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after my German lesson.  Miss Prism.  Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way.  He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for town yesterday.  Indeed, he always lays stress on your German when he is leaving for town.  Cecily.  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!  Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite well.  Miss Prism.  [Drawing herself up.]  Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is.  I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility.  Cecily.  I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together.  Miss Prism.  Cecily!  I am surprised at you.  Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life.  Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation.  You must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man his brother.  Cecily.  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes.  We might have a good influence over him, Miss Prism.  I am sure you certainly would.  You know German, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.  [Cecily begins to write in her diary.]  Miss Prism.  [Shaking her head.]  I do not think that even I could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother's admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.  Indeed I am not sure that I would desire to reclaim him.  I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment's notice.  As a man sows so let him reap.  You must put away your diary, Cecily.  I really don't see why you should keep a diary at all.  Cecily.  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life.  If I didn't write them down, I should probably forget all about them.  Miss Prism.  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.  Cecily.  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn't possibly have happened.  I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.  Miss Prism.  Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one myself in earlier days.  Cecily.  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How wonderfully clever you are!  I hope it did not end happily?  I don't like novels that end happily.  They depress me so much.  Miss Prism.  The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is what Fiction means.  Cecily.  I suppose so.  But it seems very unfair.  And was your novel ever published?  Miss Prism.  Alas! no.  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]  I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.  To your work, child, these speculations are profitless.  Cecily.  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.  Miss Prism.  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr. Chasuble!  This is indeed a pleasure.  [Enter Canon Chasuble.]  Chasuble.  And how are we this morning?  Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?  Cecily.  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  I think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park, Dr. Chasuble.  Miss Prism.  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.  Cecily.  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had a headache.  Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German lesson, when the Rector came in.  Chasuble.  I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.  Cecily.  Oh, I am afraid I am.  Chasuble.  That is strange.  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism's pupil, I would hang upon her lips.  [Miss Prism glares.]  I spoke metaphorically.--My metaphor was drawn from bees.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from town yet?  Miss Prism.  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.  Chasuble.  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.  He is not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that unfortunate young man his brother seems to be.  But I must not disturb Egeria and her pupil any longer.  Miss Prism.  Egeria?  My name is Laetitia, Doctor.  Chasuble.  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?  Miss Prism.  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you.  I find I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.  Chasuble.  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure.  We might go as far as the schools and back.  Miss Prism.  That would be delightful.  Cecily, you will read your Political Economy in my absence.  The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit.  It is somewhat too sensational.  Even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side.  [Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]  Cecily.  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  Horrid Political Economy!  Horrid Geography!  Horrid, horrid German!  [Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]  Merriman.  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  He has brought his luggage with him.  Cecily.  [Takes the card and reads it.]  'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany, W.'  Uncle Jack's brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?  Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.  He said he was anxious to speak to you privately for a moment.  Cecily.  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.  Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Merriman goes off.]  Cecily.  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel rather frightened.  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.  [Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  He does!  Algernon.  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I'm sure.  Cecily.  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact, I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.  [Algernon is rather taken aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from your card, are Uncle Jack's brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.  Algernon.  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn't think that I am wicked.  Cecily.  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner.  I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.  That would be hypocrisy.  Algernon.  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have been rather reckless.  Cecily.  I am glad to hear it.  Algernon.  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way.  Cecily.  I don't think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must have been very pleasant.  Algernon.  It is much pleasanter being here with you.  Cecily.  I can't understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won't be back till Monday afternoon.  Algernon.  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by the first train on Monday morning.  I have a business appointment that I am anxious . . . to miss?  Cecily.  Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?  Algernon.  No: the appointment is in London.  Cecily.  Well, I know, of course, how important it is not to keep a business engagement, if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life, but still I think you had better wait till Uncle Jack arrives.  I know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating.  Algernon.  About my what?  Cecily.  Your emigrating.  He has gone up to buy your outfit.  Algernon.  I certainly wouldn't let Jack buy my outfit.  He has no taste in neckties at all.  Cecily.  I don't think you will require neckties.  Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.  Algernon.  Australia!  I'd sooner die.  Cecily.  Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night, that you would have to choose between this world, the next world, and Australia.  Algernon.  Oh, well!  The accounts I have received of Australia and the next world, are not particularly encouraging.  This world is good enough for me, cousin Cecily.  Cecily.  Yes, but are you good enough for it?  Algernon.  I'm afraid I'm not that.  That is why I want you to reform me. You might make that your mission, if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.  Cecily.  I'm afraid I've no time, this afternoon.  Algernon.  Well, would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon?  Cecily.  It is rather Quixotic of you.  But I think you should try.  Algernon.  I will.  I feel better already.  Cecily.  You are looking a little worse.  Algernon.  That is because I am hungry.  Cecily.  How thoughtless of me.  I should have remembered that when one is going to lead an entirely new life, one requires regular and wholesome meals.  Won't you come in?  Algernon.  Thank you.  Might I have a buttonhole first?  I never have any appetite unless I have a buttonhole first.  Cecily.  A Marechal Niel?  [Picks up scissors.]  Algernon.  No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.  Cecily.  Why?  [Cuts a flower.]  Algernon.  Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.  Cecily.  I don't think it can be right for you to talk to me like that. Miss Prism never says such things to me.  Algernon.  Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.  [Cecily puts the rose in his buttonhole.]  You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.  Cecily.  Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.  Algernon.  They are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.  Cecily.  Oh, I don't think I would care to catch a sensible man.  I shouldn't know what to talk to him about.  [They pass into the house.  Miss Prism and Dr. Chasuble return.]  Miss Prism.  You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.  You should get married.  A misanthrope I can understand--a womanthrope, never!  Chasuble.  [With a scholar's shudder.]  Believe me, I do not deserve so neologistic a phrase.  The precept as well as the practice of the Primitive Church was distinctly against matrimony.  Miss Prism.  [Sententiously.]  That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.  And you do not seem to realise, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.  Chasuble.  But is a man not equally attractive when married?  Miss Prism.  No married man is ever attractive except to his wife.  Chasuble.  And often, I've been told, not even to her.  Miss Prism.  That depends on the intellectual sympathies of the woman. Maturity can always be depended on.  Ripeness can be trusted.  Young women are green.  [Dr. Chasuble starts.]  I spoke horticulturally.  My metaphor was drawn from fruits.  But where is Cecily?  Chasuble.  Perhaps she followed us to the schools.  [Enter Jack slowly from the back of the garden.  He is dressed in the deepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves.]  Miss Prism.  Mr. Worthing!  Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing?  Miss Prism.  This is indeed a surprise.  We did not look for you till Monday afternoon.  Jack.  [Shakes Miss Prism's hand in a tragic manner.]  I have returned sooner than I expected.  Dr. Chasuble, I hope you are well?  Chasuble.  Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe does not betoken some terrible calamity?  Jack.  My brother.  Miss Prism.  More shameful debts and extravagance?  Chasuble.  Still leading his life of pleasure?  Jack.  [Shaking his head.]  Dead!  Chasuble.  Your brother Ernest dead?  Jack.  Quite dead.  Miss Prism.  What a lesson for him!  I trust he will profit by it.  Chasuble.  Mr. Worthing, I offer you my sincere condolence.  You have at least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and forgiving of brothers.  Jack.  Poor Ernest!  He had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.  Chasuble.  Very sad indeed.  Were you with him at the end?  Jack.  No.  He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.  I had a telegram last night from the manager of the Grand Hotel.  Chasuble.  Was the cause of death mentioned?  Jack.  A severe chill, it seems.  Miss Prism.  As a man sows, so shall he reap.  Chasuble.  [Raising his hand.]  Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!  None of us are perfect.  I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.  Will the interment take place here?  Jack.  No.  He seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in Paris.  Chasuble.  In Paris!  [Shakes his head.]  I fear that hardly points to any very serious state of mind at the last.  You would no doubt wish me to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next Sunday.  [Jack presses his hand convulsively.]  My sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion, joyful, or, as in the present case, distressing.  [All sigh.]  I have preached it at harvest celebrations, christenings, confirmations, on days of humiliation and festal days.  The last time I delivered it was in the Cathedral, as a charity sermon on behalf of the Society for the Prevention of Discontent among the Upper Orders.  The Bishop, who was present, was much struck by some of the analogies I drew.  Jack.  Ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings I think, Dr. Chasuble?  I suppose you know how to christen all right?  [Dr. Chasuble looks astounded.]  I mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren't you?  Miss Prism.  It is, I regret to say, one of the Rector's most constant duties in this parish.  I have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.  But they don't seem to know what thrift is.  Chasuble.  But is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, Mr. Worthing?  Your brother was, I believe, unmarried, was he not?  Jack.  Oh yes.  Miss Prism.  [Bitterly.]  People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.  Jack.  But it is not for any child, dear Doctor.  I am very fond of children.  No! the fact is, I would like to be christened myself, this afternoon, if you have nothing better to do.  Chasuble.  But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have been christened already?  Jack.  I don't remember anything about it.  Chasuble.  But have you any grave doubts on the subject?  Jack.  I certainly intend to have.  Of course I don't know if the thing would bother you in any way, or if you think I am a little too old now.  Chasuble.  Not at all.  The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion of adults is a perfectly canonical practice.  Jack.  Immersion!  Chasuble.  You need have no apprehensions.  Sprinkling is all that is necessary, or indeed I think advisable.  Our weather is so changeable.  At what hour would you wish the ceremony performed?  Jack.  Oh, I might trot round about five if that would suit you.  Chasuble.  Perfectly, perfectly!  In fact I have two similar ceremonies to perform at that time.  A case of twins that occurred recently in one of the outlying cottages on your own estate.  Poor Jenkins the carter, a most hard-working man.  Jack.  Oh!  I don't see much fun in being christened along with other babies.  It would be childish.  Would half-past five do?  Chasuble.  Admirably!  Admirably!  [Takes out watch.]  And now, dear Mr. Worthing, I will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  I would merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  What seem to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.  Miss Prism.  This seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.  [Enter Cecily from the house.]  Cecily.  Uncle Jack!  Oh, I am pleased to see you back.  But what horrid clothes you have got on!  Do go and change them.  Miss Prism.  Cecily!  Chasuble.  My child! my child!  [Cecily goes towards Jack; he kisses her brow in a melancholy manner.]  Cecily.  What is the matter, Uncle Jack?  Do look happy!  You look as if you had toothache, and I have got such a surprise for you.  Who do you think is in the dining-room?  Your brother!  Jack.  Who?  Cecily.  Your brother Ernest.  He arrived about half an hour ago.  Jack.  What nonsense!  I haven't got a brother.  Cecily.  Oh, don't say that.  However badly he may have behaved to you in the past he is still your brother.  You couldn't be so heartless as to disown him.  I'll tell him to come out.  And you will shake hands with him, won't you, Uncle Jack?  [Runs back into the house.]  Chasuble.  These are very joyful tidings.  Miss Prism.  After we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to me peculiarly distressing.  Jack.  My brother is in the dining-room?  I don't know what it all means. I think it is perfectly absurd.  [Enter Algernon and Cecily hand in hand.  They come slowly up to Jack.]  Jack.  Good heavens!  [Motions Algernon away.]  Algernon.  Brother John, I have come down from town to tell you that I am very sorry for all the trouble I have given you, and that I intend to lead a better life in the future.  [Jack glares at him and does not take his hand.]  Cecily.  Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse your own brother's hand?  Jack.  Nothing will induce me to take his hand.  I think his coming down here disgraceful.  He knows perfectly well why.  Cecily.  Uncle Jack, do be nice.  There is some good in every one.  Ernest has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury whom he goes to visit so often.  And surely there must be much good in one who is kind to an invalid, and leaves the pleasures of London to sit by a bed of pain.  Jack.  Oh! he has been talking about Bunbury, has he?  Cecily.  Yes, he has told me all about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state of health.  Jack.  Bunbury!  Well, I won't have him talk to you about Bunbury or about anything else.  It is enough to drive one perfectly frantic.  Algernon.  Of course I admit that the faults were all on my side.  But I must say that I think that Brother John's coldness to me is peculiarly painful.  I expected a more enthusiastic welcome, especially considering it is the first time I have come here.  Cecily.  Uncle Jack, if you don't shake hands with Ernest I will never forgive you.  Jack.  Never forgive me?  Cecily.  Never, never, never!  Jack.  Well, this is the last time I shall ever do it.  [Shakes with Algernon and glares.]  Chasuble.  It's pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation? I think we might leave the two brothers together.  Miss Prism.  Cecily, you will come with us.  Cecily.  Certainly, Miss Prism.  My little task of reconciliation is over.  Chasuble.  You have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.  Miss Prism.  We must not be premature in our judgments.  Cecily.  I feel very happy.  [They all go off except Jack and Algernon.]  Jack.  You young scoundrel, Algy, you must get out of this place as soon as possible.  I don't allow any Bunburying here.  [Enter Merriman.]  Merriman.  I have put Mr. Ernest's things in the room next to yours, sir. I suppose that is all right?  Jack.  What?  Merriman.  Mr. Ernest's luggage, sir.  I have unpacked it and put it in the room next to your own.  Jack.  His luggage?  Merriman.  Yes, sir.  Three portmanteaus, a dressing-case, two hat-boxes, and a large luncheon-basket.  Algernon.  I am afraid I can't stay more than a week this time.  Jack.  Merriman, order the dog-cart at once.  Mr. Ernest has been suddenly called back to town.  Merriman.  Yes, sir.  [Goes back into the house.]  Algernon.  What a fearful liar you are, Jack.  I have not been called back to town at all.  Jack.  Yes, you have.  Algernon.  I haven't heard any one call me.  Jack.  Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.  Algernon.  My duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree.  Jack.  I can quite understand that.  Algernon.  Well, Cecily is a darling.  Jack.  You are not to talk of Miss Cardew like that.  I don't like it.  Algernon.  Well, I don't like your clothes.  You look perfectly ridiculous in them.  Why on earth don't you go up and change?  It is perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a man who is actually staying for a whole week with you in your house as a guest.  I call it grotesque.  Jack.  You are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or anything else.  You have got to leave . . . by the four-five train.  Algernon.  I certainly won't leave you so long as you are in mourning.  It would be most unfriendly.  If I were in mourning you would stay with me, I suppose.  I should think it very unkind if you didn't.  Jack.  Well, will you go if I change my clothes?  Algernon.  Yes, if you are not too long.  I never saw anybody take so long to dress, and with such little result.  Jack.  Well, at any rate, that is better than being always over-dressed as you are.  Algernon.  If I am occasionally a little over-dressed, I make up for it by being always immensely over-educated.  Jack.  Your vanity is ridiculous, your conduct an outrage, and your presence in my garden utterly absurd.  However, you have got to catch the four-five, and I hope you will have a pleasant journey back to town.  This Bunburying, as you call it, has not been a great success for you.  [Goes into the house.]  Algernon.  I think it has been a great success.  I'm in love with Cecily, and that is everything.  [Enter Cecily at the back of the garden.  She picks up the can and begins to water the flowers.]  But I must see her before I go, and make arrangements for another Bunbury.  Ah, there she is.  Cecily.  Oh, I merely came back to water the roses.  I thought you were with Uncle Jack.  Algernon.  He's gone to order the dog-cart for me.  Cecily.  Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?  Algernon.  He's going to send me away.  Cecily.  Then have we got to part?  Algernon.  I am afraid so.  It's a very painful parting.  Cecily.  It is always painful to part from people whom one has known for a very brief space of time.  The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity.  But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable.  Algernon.  Thank you.  [Enter Merriman.]  Merriman.  The dog-cart is at the door, sir.  [Algernon looks appealingly at Cecily.]  Cecily.  It can wait, Merriman for . . . five minutes.  Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Exit Merriman.]  Algernon.  I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you if I state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every way the visible personification of absolute perfection.  Cecily.  I think your frankness does you great credit, Ernest.  If you will allow me, I will copy your remarks into my diary.  [Goes over to table and begins writing in diary.]  Algernon.  Do you really keep a diary?  I'd give anything to look at it. May I?  Cecily.  Oh no.  [Puts her hand over it.]  You see, it is simply a very young girl's record of her own thoughts and impressions, and consequently meant for publication.  When it appears in volume form I hope you will order a copy.  But pray, Ernest, don't stop.  I delight in taking down from dictation.  I have reached 'absolute perfection'.  You can go on.  I am quite ready for more.  Algernon.  [Somewhat taken aback.]  Ahem!  Ahem!  Cecily.  Oh, don't cough, Ernest.  When one is dictating one should speak fluently and not cough.  Besides, I don't know how to spell a cough. [Writes as Algernon speaks.]  Algernon.  [Speaking very rapidly.]  Cecily, ever since I first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty, I have dared to love you wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.  Cecily.  I don't think that you should tell me that you love me wildly, passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.  Hopelessly doesn't seem to make much sense, does it?  Algernon.  Cecily!  [Enter Merriman.]  Merriman.  The dog-cart is waiting, sir.  Algernon.  Tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.  Merriman.  [Looks at Cecily, who makes no sign.]  Yes, sir.  [Merriman retires.]  Cecily.  Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on till next week, at the same hour.  Algernon.  Oh, I don't care about Jack.  I don't care for anybody in the whole world but you.  I love you, Cecily.  You will marry me, won't you?  Cecily.  You silly boy!  Of course.  Why, we have been engaged for the last three months.  Algernon.  For the last three months?  Cecily.  Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.  Algernon.  But how did we become engaged?  Cecily.  Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed to us that he had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and Miss Prism.  And of course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  One feels there must|2
37| be something in him, after all.  I daresay it was foolish of me, but I fell in love with you, Ernest.  Algernon.  Darling!  And when was the engagement actually settled?  Cecily.  On the 14th of February last.  Worn out by your entire ignorance of my existence, I determined to end the matter one way or the other, and after a long struggle with myself I accepted you under this dear old tree here.  The next day I bought this little ring in your name, and this is the little bangle with the true lover's knot I promised you always to wear.  Algernon.  Did I give you this?  It's very pretty, isn't it?  Cecily.  Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest.  It's the excuse I've always given for your leading such a bad life.  And this is the box in which I keep all your dear letters.  [Kneels at table, opens box, and produces letters tied up with blue ribbon.]  Algernon.  My letters!  But, my own sweet Cecily, I have never written you any letters.  Cecily.  You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.  I remember only too well that I was forced to write your letters for you.  I wrote always three times a week, and sometimes oftener.  Algernon.  Oh, do let me read them, Cecily?  Cecily.  Oh, I couldn't possibly.  They would make you far too conceited. [Replaces box.]  The three you wrote me after I had broken off the engagement are so beautiful, and so badly spelled, that even now I can hardly read them without crying a little.  Algernon.  But was our engagement ever broken off?  Cecily.  Of course it was.  On the 22nd of last March.  You can see the entry if you like. [Shows diary.]  'To-day I broke off my engagement with Ernest.  I feel it is better to do so.  The weather still continues charming.'  Algernon.  But why on earth did you break it off?  What had I done?  I had done nothing at all.  Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off.  Particularly when the weather was so charming.  Cecily.  It would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadn't been broken off at least once.  But I forgave you before the week was out.  Algernon.  [Crossing to her, and kneeling.]  What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.  Cecily.  You dear romantic boy.  [He kisses her, she puts her fingers through his hair.]  I hope your hair curls naturally, does it?  Algernon.  Yes, darling, with a little help from others.  Cecily.  I am so glad.  Algernon.  You'll never break off our engagement again, Cecily?  Cecily.  I don't think I could break it off now that I have actually met you.  Besides, of course, there is the question of your name.  Algernon.  Yes, of course.  [Nervously.]  Cecily.  You must not laugh at me, darling, but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some one whose name was Ernest.  [Algernon rises, Cecily also.]  There is something in that name that seems to inspire absolute confidence.  I pity any poor married woman whose husband is not called Ernest.  Algernon.  But, my dear child, do you mean to say you could not love me if I had some other name?  Cecily.  But what name?  Algernon.  Oh, any name you like--Algernon--for instance . . .  Cecily.  But I don't like the name of Algernon.  Algernon.  Well, my own dear, sweet, loving little darling, I really can't see why you should object to the name of Algernon.  It is not at all a bad name.  In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.  Half of the chaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon.  But seriously, Cecily . . . [Moving to her] . . . if my name was Algy, couldn't you love me?  Cecily.  [Rising.]  I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided attention.  Algernon.  Ahem!  Cecily!  [Picking up hat.]  Your Rector here is, I suppose, thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials of the Church?  Cecily.  Oh, yes.  Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.  He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.  Algernon.  I must see him at once on a most important christening--I mean on most important business.  Cecily.  Oh!  Algernon.  I shan't be away more than half an hour.  Cecily.  Considering that we have been engaged since February the 14th, and that I only met you to-day for the first time, I think it is rather hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour. Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?  Algernon.  I'll be back in no time.  [Kisses her and rushes down the garden.]  Cecily.  What an impetuous boy he is!  I like his hair so much.  I must enter his proposal in my diary.  [Enter Merriman.]  Merriman.  A Miss Fairfax has just called to see Mr. Worthing.  On very important business, Miss Fairfax states.  Cecily.  Isn't Mr. Worthing in his library?  Merriman.  Mr. Worthing went over in the direction of the Rectory some time ago.  Cecily.  Pray ask the lady to come out here; Mr. Worthing is sure to be back soon.  And you can bring tea.  Merriman.  Yes, Miss.  [Goes out.]  Cecily.  Miss Fairfax!  I suppose one of the many good elderly women who are associated with Uncle Jack in some of his philanthropic work in London.  I don't quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work.  I think it is so forward of them.  [Enter Merriman.]  Merriman.  Miss Fairfax.  [Enter Gwendolen.]  [Exit Merriman.]  Cecily.  [Advancing to meet her.]  Pray let me introduce myself to you. My name is Cecily Cardew.  Gwendolen.  Cecily Cardew?  [Moving to her and shaking hands.]  What a very sweet name!  Something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  I like you already more than I can say.  My first impressions of people are never wrong.  Cecily.  How nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short time.  Pray sit down.  Gwendolen.  [Still standing up.]  I may call you Cecily, may I not?  Cecily.  With pleasure!  Gwendolen.  And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?  Cecily.  If you wish.  Gwendolen.  Then that is all quite settled, is it not?  Cecily.  I hope so.  [A pause.  They both sit down together.]  Gwendolen.  Perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who I am.  My father is Lord Bracknell.  You have never heard of papa, I suppose?  Cecily.  I don't think so.  Gwendolen.  Outside the family circle, papa, I am glad to say, is entirely unknown.  I think that is quite as it should be.  The home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the man.  And certainly once a man begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate, does he not?  And I don't like that.  It makes men so very attractive. Cecily, mamma, whose views on education are remarkably strict, has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted; it is part of her system; so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?  Cecily.  Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.  I am very fond of being looked at.  Gwendolen.  [After examining Cecily carefully through a lorgnette.]  You are here on a short visit, I suppose.  Cecily.  Oh no!  I live here.  Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?  Cecily.  Oh no!  I have no mother, nor, in fact, any relations.  Gwendolen.  Indeed?  Cecily.  My dear guardian, with the assistance of Miss Prism, has the arduous task of looking after me.  Gwendolen.  Your guardian?  Cecily.  Yes, I am Mr. Worthing's ward.  Gwendolen.  Oh!  It is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward.  How secretive of him!  He grows more interesting hourly.  I am not sure, however, that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.  [Rising and going to her.]  I am very fond of you, Cecily; I have liked you ever since I met you!  But I am bound to state that now that I know that you are Mr. Worthing's ward, I cannot help expressing a wish you were--well, just a little older than you seem to be--and not quite so very alluring in appearance.  In fact, if I may speak candidly--  Cecily.  Pray do!  I think that whenever one has anything unpleasant to say, one should always be quite candid.  Gwendolen.  Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily, I wish that you were fully forty-two, and more than usually plain for your age.  Ernest has a strong upright nature.  He is the very soul of truth and honour. Disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception.  But even men of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others.  Modern, no less than Ancient History, supplies us with many most painful examples of what I refer to. If it were not so, indeed, History would be quite unreadable.  Cecily.  I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?  Gwendolen.  Yes.  Cecily.  Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is my guardian.  It is his brother--his elder brother.  Gwendolen.  [Sitting down again.]  Ernest never mentioned to me that he had a brother.  Cecily.  I am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long time.  Gwendolen.  Ah! that accounts for it.  And now that I think of it I have never heard any man mention his brother.  The subject seems distasteful to most men.  Cecily, you have lifted a load from my mind.  I was growing almost anxious.  It would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours, would it not?  Of course you are quite, quite sure that it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing who is your guardian?  Cecily.  Quite sure.  [A pause.]  In fact, I am going to be his.  Gwendolen.  [Inquiringly.]  I beg your pardon?  Cecily.  [Rather shy and confidingly.]  Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why I should make a secret of it to you.  Our little county newspaper is sure to chronicle the fact next week.  Mr. Ernest Worthing and I are engaged to be married.  Gwendolen.  [Quite politely, rising.]  My darling Cecily, I think there must be some slight error.  Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.  The announcement will appear in the _Morning Post_ on Saturday at the latest.  Cecily.  [Very politely, rising.]  I am afraid you must be under some misconception.  Ernest proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago.  [Shows diary.]  Gwendolen.  [Examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully.]  It is certainly very curious, for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at 5.30.  If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. [Produces diary of her own.]  I never travel without my diary.  One should always have something sensational to read in the train.  I am so sorry, dear Cecily, if it is any disappointment to you, but I am afraid I have the prior claim.  Cecily.  It would distress me more than I can tell you, dear Gwendolen, if it caused you any mental or physical anguish, but I feel bound to point out that since Ernest proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind.  Gwendolen.  [Meditatively.]  If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm hand.  Cecily.  [Thoughtfully and sadly.]  Whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into, I will never reproach him with it after we are married.  Gwendolen.  Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew, as an entanglement?  You are presumptuous.  On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind.  It becomes a pleasure.  Cecily.  Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I entrapped Ernest into an engagement?  How dare you?  This is no time for wearing the shallow mask of manners.  When I see a spade I call it a spade.  Gwendolen.  [Satirically.]  I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.  [Enter Merriman, followed by the footman.  He carries a salver, table cloth, and plate stand.  Cecily is about to retort.  The presence of the servants exercises a restraining influence, under which both girls chafe.]  Merriman.  Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?  Cecily.  [Sternly, in a calm voice.]  Yes, as usual.  [Merriman begins to clear table and lay cloth.  A long pause.  Cecily and Gwendolen glare at each other.]  Gwendolen.  Are there many interesting walks in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?  Cecily.  Oh! yes! a great many.  From the top of one of the hills quite close one can see five counties.  Gwendolen.  Five counties!  I don't think I should like that; I hate crowds.  Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]  Gwendolen.  [Looking round.]  Quite a well-kept garden this is, Miss Cardew.  Cecily.  So glad you like it, Miss Fairfax.  Gwendolen.  I had no idea there were any flowers in the country.  Cecily.  Oh, flowers are as common here, Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.  Gwendolen.  Personally I cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the country, if anybody who is anybody does.  The country always bores me to death.  Cecily.  Ah!  This is what the newspapers call agricultural depression, is it not?  I believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at present.  It is almost an epidemic amongst them, I have been told.  May I offer you some tea, Miss Fairfax?  Gwendolen.  [With elaborate politeness.]  Thank you.  [Aside.]  Detestable girl!  But I require tea!  Cecily.  [Sweetly.]  Sugar?  Gwendolen.  [Superciliously.]  No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable any more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.]  Cecily.  [Severely.]  Cake or bread and butter?  Gwendolen.  [In a bored manner.]  Bread and butter, please.  Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.  Cecily.  [Cuts a very large slice of cake, and puts it on the tray.]  Hand that to Miss Fairfax.  [Merriman does so, and goes out with footman.  Gwendolen drinks the tea and makes a grimace.  Puts down cup at once, reaches out her hand to the bread and butter, looks at it, and finds it is cake.  Rises in indignation.]  Gwendolen.  You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar, and though I asked most distinctly for bread and butter, you have given me cake.  I am known for the gentleness of my disposition, and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature, but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.  Cecily.  [Rising.]  To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.  Gwendolen.  From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.  I felt that you were false and deceitful.  I am never deceived in such matters.  My first impressions of people are invariably right.  Cecily.  It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I am trespassing on your valuable time.  No doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make in the neighbourhood.  [Enter Jack.]  Gwendolen.  [Catching sight of him.]  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  Jack.  Gwendolen!  Darling!  [Offers to kiss her.]  Gwendolen.  [Draws back.]  A moment!  May I ask if you are engaged to be married to this young lady?  [Points to Cecily.]  Jack.  [Laughing.]  To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?  Gwendolen.  Thank you.  You may!  [Offers her cheek.]  Cecily.  [Very sweetly.]  I knew there must be some misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.  The gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my guardian, Mr. John Worthing.  Gwendolen.  I beg your pardon?  Cecily.  This is Uncle Jack.  Gwendolen.  [Receding.]  Jack!  Oh!  [Enter Algernon.]  Cecily.  Here is Ernest.  Algernon.  [Goes straight over to Cecily without noticing any one else.] My own love!  [Offers to kiss her.]  Cecily.  [Drawing back.]  A moment, Ernest!  May I ask you--are you engaged to be married to this young lady?  Algernon.  [Looking round.]  To what young lady?  Good heavens! Gwendolen!  Cecily.  Yes! to good heavens, Gwendolen, I mean to Gwendolen.  Algernon.  [Laughing.]  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?  Cecily.  Thank you.  [Presenting her cheek to be kissed.]  You may. [Algernon kisses her.]  Gwendolen.  I felt there was some slight error, Miss Cardew.  The gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin, Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.  Cecily.  [Breaking away from Algernon.]  Algernon Moncrieff!  Oh!  [The two girls move towards each other and put their arms round each other's waists as if for protection.]  Cecily.  Are you called Algernon?  Algernon.  I cannot deny it.  Cecily.  Oh!  Gwendolen.  Is your name really John?  Jack.  [Standing rather proudly.]  I could deny it if I liked.  I could deny anything if I liked.  But my name certainly is John.  It has been John for years.  Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  A gross deception has been practised on both of us.  Gwendolen.  My poor wounded Cecily!  Cecily.  My sweet wronged Gwendolen!  Gwendolen.  [Slowly and seriously.]  You will call me sister, will you not?  [They embrace.  Jack and Algernon groan and walk up and down.]  Cecily.  [Rather brightly.]  There is just one question I would like to be allowed to ask my guardian.  Gwendolen.  An admirable idea!  Mr. Worthing, there is just one question I would like to be permitted to put to you.  Where is your brother Ernest?  We are both engaged to be married to your brother Ernest, so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where your brother Ernest is at present.  Jack.  [Slowly and hesitatingly.]  Gwendolen--Cecily--it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth.  It is the first time in my life that I have ever been reduced to such a painful position, and I am really quite inexperienced in doing anything of the kind.  However, I will tell you quite frankly that I have no brother Ernest.  I have no brother at all.  I never had a brother in my life, and I certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having one in the future.  Cecily.  [Surprised.]  No brother at all?  Jack.  [Cheerily.]  None!  Gwendolen.  [Severely.]  Had you never a brother of any kind?  Jack.  [Pleasantly.]  Never.  Not even of any kind.  Gwendolen.  I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily, that neither of us is engaged to be married to any one.  Cecily.  It is not a very pleasant position for a young girl suddenly to find herself in.  Is it?  Gwendolen.  Let us go into the house.  They will hardly venture to come after us there.  Cecily.  No, men are so cowardly, aren't they?  [They retire into the house with scornful looks.]  Jack.  This ghastly state of things is what you call Bunburying, I suppose?  Algernon.  Yes, and a perfectly wonderful Bunbury it is.  The most wonderful Bunbury I have ever had in my life.  Jack.  Well, you've no right whatsoever to Bunbury here.  Algernon.  That is absurd.  One has a right to Bunbury anywhere one chooses.  Every serious Bunburyist knows that.  Jack.  Serious Bunburyist!  Good heavens!  Algernon.  Well, one must be serious about something, if one wants to have any amusement in life.  I happen to be serious about Bunburying. What on earth you are serious about I haven't got the remotest idea. About everything, I should fancy.  You have such an absolutely trivial nature.  Jack.  Well, the only small satisfaction I have in the whole of this wretched business is that your friend Bunbury is quite exploded.  You won't be able to run down to the country quite so often as you used to do, dear Algy.  And a very good thing too.  Algernon.  Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he, dear Jack?  You won't be able to disappear to London quite so frequently as your wicked custom was.  And not a bad thing either.  Jack.  As for your conduct towards Miss Cardew, I must say that your taking in a sweet, simple, innocent girl like that is quite inexcusable. To say nothing of the fact that she is my ward.  Algernon.  I can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving a brilliant, clever, thoroughly experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.  Jack.  I wanted to be engaged to Gwendolen, that is all.  I love her.  Algernon.  Well, I simply wanted to be engaged to Cecily.  I adore her.  Jack.  There is certainly no chance of your marrying Miss Cardew.  Algernon.  I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack, of you and Miss Fairfax being united.  Jack.  Well, that is no business of yours.  Algernon.  If it was my business, I wouldn't talk about it.  [Begins to eat muffins.]  It is very vulgar to talk about one's business.  Only people like stock-brokers do that, and then merely at dinner parties.  Jack.  How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can't make out.  You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.  Algernon.  Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner.  The butter would probably get on my cuffs.  One should always eat muffins quite calmly.  It is the only way to eat them.  Jack.  I say it's perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all, under the circumstances.  Algernon.  When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.  Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins.  [Rising.]  Jack.  [Rising.]  Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]  Algernon.  [Offering tea-cake.]  I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don't like tea-cake.  Jack.  Good heavens!  I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own garden.  Algernon.  But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.  Jack.  I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That is a very different thing.  Algernon.  That may be.  But the muffins are the same.  [He seizes the muffin-dish from Jack.]  Jack.  Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.  Algernon.  You can't possibly ask me to go without having some dinner. It's absurd.  I never go without my dinner.  No one ever does, except vegetarians and people like that.  Besides I have just made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble to be christened at a quarter to six under the name of Ernest.  Jack.  My dear fellow, the sooner you give up that nonsense the better.  I made arrangements this morning with Dr. Chasuble to be christened myself at 5.30, and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.  Gwendolen would wish it.  We can't both be christened Ernest.  It's absurd.  Besides, I have a perfect right to be christened if I like.  There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody.  I should think it extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble.  It is entirely different in your case.  You have been christened already.  Algernon.  Yes, but I have not been christened for years.  Jack.  Yes, but you have been christened.  That is the important thing.  Algernon.  Quite so.  So I know my constitution can stand it.  If you are not quite sure about your ever having been christened, I must say I think it rather dangerous your venturing on it now.  It might make you very unwell.  You can hardly have forgotten that some one very closely connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in Paris by a severe chill.  Jack.  Yes, but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary.  Algernon.  It usen't to be, I know--but I daresay it is now.  Science is always making wonderful improvements in things.  Jack.  [Picking up the muffin-dish.]  Oh, that is nonsense; you are always talking nonsense.  Algernon.  Jack, you are at the muffins again!  I wish you wouldn't. There are only two left.  [Takes them.]  I told you I was particularly fond of muffins.  Jack.  But I hate tea-cake.  Algernon.  Why on earth then do you allow tea-cake to be served up for your guests?  What ideas you have of hospitality!  Jack.  Algernon!  I have already told you to go.  I don't want you here. Why don't you go!  Algernon.  I haven't quite finished my tea yet! and there is still one muffin left.  [Jack groans, and sinks into a chair.  Algernon still continues eating.]  ACT DROP     THIRD ACT   SCENE   Morning-room at the Manor House.  [Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.]  Gwendolen.  The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left.  Cecily.  They have been eating muffins.  That looks like repentance.  Gwendolen.  [After a pause.]  They don't seem to notice us at all. Couldn't you cough?  Cecily.  But I haven't got a cough.  Gwendolen.  They're looking at us.  What effrontery!  Cecily.  They're approaching.  That's very forward of them.  Gwendolen.  Let us preserve a dignified silence.  Cecily.  Certainly.  It's the only thing to do now.  [Enter Jack followed by Algernon.  They whistle some dreadful popular air from a British Opera.]  Gwendolen.  This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.  Cecily.  A most distasteful one.  Gwendolen.  But we will not be the first to speak.  Cecily.  Certainly not.  Gwendolen.  Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you. Much depends on your reply.  Cecily.  Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.  Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question.  Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?  Algernon.  In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.  Cecily.  [To Gwendolen.]  That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?  Gwendolen.  Yes, dear, if you can believe him.  Cecily.  I don't.  But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.  Gwendolen.  True.  In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.  Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother?  Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?  Jack.  Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?  Gwendolen.  I have the gravest doubts upon the subject.  But I intend to crush them.  This is not the moment for German scepticism.  [Moving to Cecily.]  Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr. Worthing's.  That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.  Cecily.  I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.  His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.  Gwendolen.  Then you think we should forgive them?  Cecily.  Yes.  I mean no.  Gwendolen.  True!  I had forgotten.  There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender.  Which of us should tell them?  The task is not a pleasant one.  Cecily.  Could we not both speak at the same time?  Gwendolen.  An excellent idea!  I nearly always speak at the same time as other people.  Will you take the time from me?  Cecily.  Certainly.  [Gwendolen beats time with uplifted finger.]  Gwendolen and Cecily [Speaking together.]  Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier.  That is all!  Jack and Algernon [Speaking together.]  Our Christian names!  Is that all?  But we are going to be christened this afternoon.  Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?  Jack.  I am.  Cecily.  [To Algernon.]  To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?  Algernon.  I am!  Gwendolen.  How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!  Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.  Jack.  We are.  [Clasps hands with Algernon.]  Cecily.  They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.  Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  Darling!  Algernon.  [To Cecily.]  Darling!  [They fall into each other's arms.]  [Enter Merriman.  When he enters he coughs loudly, seeing the situation.]  Merriman.  Ahem!  Ahem!  Lady Bracknell!  Jack.  Good heavens!  [Enter Lady Bracknell.  The couples separate in alarm.  Exit Merriman.]  Lady Bracknell.  Gwendolen!  What does this mean?  Gwendolen.  Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  Lady Bracknell.  Come here.  Sit down.  Sit down immediately.  Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young, of physical weakness in the old.  [Turns to Jack.]  Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden flight by her trusty maid, whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin, I followed her at once by a luggage train.  Her unhappy father is, I am glad to say, under the impression that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture by the Universi|2
38|ty Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.  I do not propose to undeceive him.  Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.  I would consider it wrong.  But of course, you will clearly understand that all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment.  On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.  Jack.  I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!  Lady Bracknell.  You are nothing of the kind, sir.  And now, as regards Algernon! . . . Algernon!  Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides?  Algernon.  [Stammering.]  Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury is somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.  Lady Bracknell.  Dead!  When did Mr. Bunbury die?  His death must have been extremely sudden.  Algernon.  [Airily.]  Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.  Lady Bracknell.  What did he die of?  Algernon.  Bunbury?  Oh, he was quite exploded.  Lady Bracknell.  Exploded!  Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage? I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.  If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.  Algernon.  My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!  The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean--so Bunbury died.  Lady Bracknell.  He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.  I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. Worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?  Jack.  That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.  [Lady Bracknell bows coldly to Cecily.]  Algernon.  I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  I beg your pardon?  Cecily.  Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bracknell.  [With a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.] I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of Hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance.  I think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place.  Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in London?  I merely desire information.  Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a Terminus.  [Jack looks perfectly furious, but restrains himself.]  Jack.  [In a clear, cold voice.]  Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square, S.W.; Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.  Lady Bracknell.  That sounds not unsatisfactory.  Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.  But what proof have I of their authenticity?  Jack.  I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period.  They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bracknell.  [Grimly.]  I have known strange errors in that publication.  Jack.  Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.  Lady Bracknell.  Markby, Markby, and Markby?  A firm of the very highest position in their profession.  Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.  So far I am satisfied.  Jack.  [Very irritably.]  How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!  I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear, certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough, registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles; both the German and the English variety.  Lady Bracknell.  Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?  Jack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That is all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.  Lady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.] Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.  Jack.  And after six months nobody knew her.  Lady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a practised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecily turns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecily presents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher, dear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are worn very high, just at present.  Algernon!  Algernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!  Lady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's profile.  Algernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world.  And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.  Lady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only people who can't get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon. But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give my consent.  Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!  Cecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.  Lady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.  Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.  Algernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.  Cecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.  Lady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.  Jack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That consent I absolutely decline to give.  Lady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing, but he looks everything.  What more can one desire?  Jack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]  Lady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an Oxonian.  Jack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I've just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don't intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.  Lady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.  Jack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision, however, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.  Lady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes over.]  How old are you, dear?  Cecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.  Lady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So I don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.  Jack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.  Lady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty- five is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty- five for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.  Cecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?  Algernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.  Cecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time. I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather cross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.  Algernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?  Cecily.  I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.  Lady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five--a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature--I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.  Jack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.  Lady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.  Jack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.  Lady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen. Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.] Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.  [Enter Dr. Chasuble.]  Chasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.  Lady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?  Chasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.] Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.  Lady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious! Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses. Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.  Chasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?  Jack.  I don't think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.  Chasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing. They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.  Lady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?  Chasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.  Lady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?  Chasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.  Lady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what position she holds in your household?  Chasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.  Jack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.  Lady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once. Let her be sent for.  Chasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.  [Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]  Miss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catches sight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  Miss Prism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]  Lady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows her head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  The Canon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [Miss Prism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there! [Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]  Miss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I only wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.  Jack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit the hand-bag?  Miss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.  Jack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.  Miss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.  Jack.  What railway station?  Miss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into a chair.]  Jack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here for me.  Gwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]  Chasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?  Lady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.  [Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Every one looks up.]  Cecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.  Chasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.  Lady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he was having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are always vulgar, and often convincing.  Chasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]  Lady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.  Gwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]  Jack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism? Examine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.  Miss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And here, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly mine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.  Jack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.  Miss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?  Jack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!  Miss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am unmarried!  Jack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embrace her again.]  Miss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error. [Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.  Jack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?  Lady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon's elder brother.  Jack.  Algy's elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I had a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,--how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother. Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.  Algernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.  [Shakes hands.]  Gwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your Christian name, now that you have become some one else?  Jack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?  Gwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.  Cecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!  Jack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta, a moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened already?  Lady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.  Jack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I given?  Let me know the worst.  Lady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.  Jack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?  Lady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one. He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.  Jack.  Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?  Algernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died before I was a year old.  Jack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?  Lady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.  Jack.  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.  These delightful records should have been my constant study.  [Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.]  M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have--Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!  Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian names, Ernest John.  [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite calmly.]  I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I? Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.  Lady Bracknell.  Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.  Gwendolen.  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  I felt from the first that you could have no other name!  Jack.  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  Can you forgive me?  Gwendolen.  I can.  For I feel that you are sure to change.  Jack.  My own one!  Chasuble.  [To Miss Prism.]  Laetitia!  [Embraces her]  Miss Prism.  [Enthusiastically.]  Frederick!  At last!  Algernon.  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At last!  Jack.  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At last!  Lady Bracknell.  My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.  Jack.  On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I've now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.   HISTORICAL criticism nowhere occurs as an isolated fact in the civilisation or literature of any people.  It is part of that complex working towards freedom which may be described as the revolt against authority.  It is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an innovation, which in the sphere of action produces democracy and revolution, and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and physical science; and its importance as a factor of progress is based not so much on the results it attains, as on the tone of thought which it represents, and the method by which it works.  Being thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary, it is not to be found in the ancient world among the material despotisms of Asia or the stationary civilisation of Egypt.  The clay cylinders of Assyria and Babylon, the hieroglyphics of the pyramids, form not history but the material for history.  The Chinese annals, ascending as they do to the barbarous forest life of the nation, are marked with a soberness of judgment, a freedom from invention, which is almost unparalleled in the writings of any people; but the protective spirit which is the characteristic of that people proved as fatal to their literature as to their commerce.  Free criticism is as unknown as free trade.  While as regards the Hindus, their acute, analytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar, criticism and philosophy than to history or chronology.  Indeed, in history their imagination seems to have run wild, legend and fact are so indissolubly mingled together that any attempt to separate them seems vain.  If we except the identification of the Greek Sandracottus with the Indian Chandragupta, we have really no clue by which we can test the truth of their writings or examine their method of investigation.  It is among the Hellenic branch of the Indo-Germanic race that history proper is to be found, as well as the spirit of historical criticism; among that wonderful offshoot of the primitive Aryans, whom we call by the name of Greeks and to whom, as has been well said, we owe all that moves in the world except the blind forces of nature.  For, from the day when they left the chill table-lands of Tibet and journeyed, a nomad people, to ?gean shores, the characteristic of their nature has been the search for light, and the spirit of historical criticism is part of that wonderful Aufkl?rung or illumination of the intellect which seems to have burst on the Greek race like a great flood of light about the sixth century B.C.  _L?esprit d?un si?cle ne na?t pas et ne meurt pas ? jour fixe_, and the first critic is perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man.  It is from democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its intolerance of dogmatic authority, from physical science the alluring analogies of law and order, from philosophy the conception of an essential unity underlying the complex manifestations of phenomena.  It appears first rather as a changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research, and its earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings.  For men begin to doubt in questions of religion first, and then in matters of more secular interest; and as regards the nature of the spirit of historical criticism itself in its ultimate development, it is not confined merely to the empirical method of ascertaining whether an event happened or not, but is concerned also with the investigation into the causes of events, the general relations which phenomena of life hold to one another, and in its ultimate development passes into the wider question of the philosophy of history.  Now, while the workings of historical criticism in these two spheres of sacred and uninspired history are essentially manifestations of the same spirit, yet their methods are so different, the canons of evidence so entirely separate, and the motives in each case so unconnected, that it will be necessary for a clear estimation of the progress of Greek thought, that we should consider these two questions entirely apart from one another.  I shall then in both cases take the succession of writers in their chronological order as representing the rational order?not that the succession of time is always the succession of ideas, or that dialectics moves ever in the straight line in which Hegel conceives its advance.  In Greek thought, as elsewhere, there are periods of stagnation and apparent retrogression, yet their intellectual development, not merely in the question of historical criticism, but in their art, their poetry and their philosophy, seems so essentially normal, so free from all disturbing external influences, so peculiarly rational, that in following in the footsteps of time we shall really be progressing in the order sanctioned by reason.  AT an early period in their intellectual development the Greeks reached that critical point in the history of every civilised nation, when speculative invades the domain of revealed truth, when the spiritual ideas of the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower, material conceptions of their inspired writers, and when men find it impossible to pour the new wine of free thought into the old bottles of a narrow and a trammelling creed.  From their Aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy of a mythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which strove to hide the rational order of nature in a chaos of miracles, and to mar by imputed wickedness the perfection of God's nature?a very shirt of Nessos in which the Heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation.  Now |2
39|while undoubtedly the speculations of Thales, and the alluring analogies of law and order afforded by physical science, were most important forces in encouraging the rise of the spirit of scepticism, yet it was on its ethical side that the Greek mythology was chiefly open to attack.  It is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles, but no man will admit sin and immorality as attributes of the Ideal he worships; so the first symptoms of a new order of thought are shown in the passionate outcries of Xenophanes and Heraclitos against the evil things said by Homer of the sons of God; and in the story told of Pythagoras, how that he saw tortured in Hell the ?two founders of Greek theology,? we can recognise the rise of the Aufkl?rung as clearly as we see the Reformation foreshadowed in the _Inferno_ of Dante.  Any honest belief, then, in the plain truth of these stories soon succumbed before the destructive effects of the _a priori_ ethical criticism of this school; but the orthodox party, as is its custom, found immediately a convenient shelter under the ?gis of the doctrine of metaphors and concealed meanings.  To this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the walls of Troy was a mystery, behind which, as behind a veil, were hidden certain moral and physical truths.  The contest between Athena and Ares was that eternal contest between rational thought and the brute force of ignorance; the arrows which rattled in the quiver of the ?Far Darter? were no longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of the child of God, but the common rays of the sun, which was itself nothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal.  Modern investigation, with the ruthlessness of Philistine analysis, has ultimately brought Helen of Troy down to a symbol of the dawn.  There were Philistines among the Greeks also who saw in the _???? ?????_ a mere metaphor for atmospheric power.  Now while this tendency to look for metaphors and hidden meanings must be ranked as one of the germs of historical criticism, yet it was essentially unscientific.  Its inherent weakness is clearly pointed out by Plato, who showed that while this theory will no doubt explain many of the current legends, yet, if it is to be appealed to at all, it must be as a universal principle; a position he is by no means prepared to admit.  Like many other great principles it suffered from its disciples, and furnished its own refutation when the web of Penelope was analysed into a metaphor of the rules of formal logic, the warp representing the premises, and the woof the conclusion.  Rejecting, then, the allegorical interpretation of the sacred writings as an essentially dangerous method, proving either too much or too little, Plato himself returns to the earlier mode of attack, and re-writes history with a didactic purpose, laying down certain ethical canons of historical criticism.  God is good; God is just; God is true; God is without the common passions of men.  These are the tests to which we are to bring the stories of the Greek religion.  ?God predestines no men to ruin, nor sends destruction on innocent cities; He never walks the earth in strange disguise, nor has to mourn for the death of any well-beloved son.  Away with the tears for Sarpedon, the lying dream sent to Agamemnon, and the story of the broken covenant!? (Plato, _Republic_, Book ii. 380; iii. 388, 391.)  Similar ethical canons are applied to the accounts of the heroes of the days of old, and by the same _a priori_ principles Achilles is rescued from the charges of avarice and insolence in a passage which may be recited as the earliest instance of that ?whitewashing of great men,? as it has been called, which is so popular in our own day, when Catiline and Clodius are represented as honest and far-seeing politicians, when _eine edle und gute Natur_ is claimed for Tiberius, and Nero is rescued from his heritage of infamy as an accomplished _dilettante_ whose moral aberrations are more than excused by his exquisite artistic sense and charming tenor voice.  But besides the allegorising principle of interpretation, and the ethical reconstruction of history, there was a third theory, which may be called the semi-historical, and which goes by the name of Euhemeros, though he was by no means the first to propound it.  Appealing to a fictitious monument which he declared that he had discovered in the island of Panchaia, and which purported to be a column erected by Zeus, and detailing the incidents of his reign on earth, this shallow thinker attempted to show that the gods and heroes of ancient Greece were ?mere ordinary mortals, whose achievements had been a good deal exaggerated and misrepresented,? and that the proper canon of historical criticism as regards the treatment of myths was to rationalise the incredible, and to present the plausible residuum as actual truth.  To him and his school, the centaurs, for instance, those mythical sons of the storm, strange links between the lives of men and animals, were merely some youths from the village of Nephele in Thessaly, distinguished for their sporting tastes; the ?living harvest of panoplied knights,? which sprang so mystically from the dragon's teeth, a body of mercenary troops supported by the profits on a successful speculation in ivory; and Act?on, an ordinary master of hounds, who, living before the days of subscription, was eaten out of house and home by the expenses of his kennel.  Now, that under the glamour of myth and legend some substratum of historical fact may lie, is a proposition rendered extremely probable by the modern investigations into the workings of the mythop?ic spirit in post-Christian times.  Charlemagne and Roland, St. Francis and William Tell, are none the less real personages because their histories are filled with much that is fictitious and incredible, but in all cases what is essentially necessary is some external corroboration, such as is afforded by the mention of Roland and Roncesvalles in the chronicles of England, or (in the sphere of Greek legend) by the excavations of Hissarlik.  But to rob a mythical narrative of its kernel of supernatural elements, and to present the dry husk thus obtained as historical fact, is, as has been well said, to mistake entirely the true method of investigation and to identify plausibility with truth.  And as regards the critical point urged by Palaiphatos, Strabo, and Polybius, that pure invention on Homer's part is inconceivable, we may without scruple allow it, for myths, like constitutions, grow gradually, and are not formed in a day.  But between a poet's deliberate creation and historical accuracy there is a wide field of the mythop?ic faculty.  This Euhemeristic theory was welcomed as an essentially philosophical and critical method by the unscientific Romans, to whom it was introduced by the poet Ennius, that pioneer of cosmopolitan Hellenicism, and it continued to characterise the tone of ancient thought on the question of the treatment of mythology till the rise of Christianity, when it was turned by such writers as Augustine and Minucius Felix into a formidable weapon of attack on Paganism.  It was then abandoned by all those who still bent the knee to Athena or to Zeus, and a general return, aided by the philosophic mystics of Alexandria, to the allegorising principle of interpretation took place, as the only means of saving the deities of Olympus from the Titan assaults of the new Galilean God.  In what vain defence, the statue of Mary set in the heart of the Pantheon can best tell us.  Religions, however, may be absorbed, but they never are disproved, and the stories of the Greek mythology, spiritualised by the purifying influence of Christianity, reappear in many of the southern parts of Europe in our own day.  The old fable that the Greek gods took service with the new religion under assumed names has more truth in it than the many care to discover.  Having now traced the progress of historical criticism in the special treatment of myth and legend, I shall proceed to investigate the form in which the same spirit manifested itself as regards what one may term secular history and secular historians.  The field traversed will be found to be in some respects the same, but the mental attitude, the spirit, the motive of investigation are all changed.  There were heroes before the son of Atreus and historians before Herodotus, yet the latter is rightly hailed as the father of history, for in him we discover not merely the empirical connection of cause and effect, but that constant reference to Laws, which is the characteristic of the historian proper.  For all history must be essentially universal; not in the sense of comprising all the synchronous events of the past time, but through the universality of the principles employed.  And the great conceptions which unify the work of Herodotus are such as even modern thought has not yet rejected.  The immediate government of the world by God, the nemesis and punishment which sin and pride invariably bring with them, the revealing of God's purpose to His people by signs and omens, by miracles and by prophecy; these are to Herodotus the laws which govern the phenomena of history.  He is essentially the type of supernatural historian; his eyes are ever strained to discern the Spirit of God moving over the face of the waters of life; he is more concerned with final than with efficient causes.  Yet we can discern in him the rise of that _historic sense_ which is the rational antecedent of the science of historical criticism, the _??????? ?????????_, to use the words of a Greek writer, as opposed to that which comes either _?????_ or _??????_.  He has passed through the valley of faith and has caught a glimpse of the sunlit heights of Reason; but like all those who, while accepting the supernatural, yet attempt to apply the canons of rationalism, he is essentially inconsistent.  For the better apprehension of the character of this historic sense in Herodotus it will be necessary to examine at some length the various forms of criticism in which it manifests itself.  Such fabulous stories as that of the Phoenix, of the goat-footed men, of the headless beings with eyes in their breasts, of the men who slept six months in the year (_????? ??? ????????? ??? ?????_), of the wer-wolf of the Neuri, and the like, are entirely rejected by him as being opposed to the ordinary experience of life, and to those natural laws whose universal influence the early Greek physical philosophers had already made known to the world of thought.  Other legends, such as the suckling of Cyrus by a bitch, or the feather-rain of northern Europe, are rationalised and explained into a woman's name and a fall of snow.  The supernatural origin of the Scythian nation, from the union of Hercules and the monstrous Echidna, is set aside by him for the more probable account that they were a nomad tribe driven by the Massaget? from Asia; and he appeals to the local names of their country as proof of the fact that the Kimmerians were the original possessors.  But in the case of Herodotus it will be more instructive to pass on from points like these to those questions of general probability, the true apprehension of which depends rather on a certain quality of mind than on any possibility of formulated rules, questions which form no unimportant part of scientific history; for it must be remembered always that the canons of historical criticism are essentially different from those of judicial evidence, for they cannot, like the latter, be made plain to every ordinary mind, but appeal to a certain historical faculty founded on the experience of life.  Besides, the rules for the reception of evidence in courts of law are purely stationary, while the science of historical probability is essentially progressive, and changes with the advancing spirit of each age.  Now, of all the speculative canons of historical criticism, none is more important than that which rests on psychological probability.  Arguing from his knowledge of human nature, Herodotus rejects the presence of Helen within the walls of Troy.  Had she been there, he says, Priam and his kinsmen would never have been so mad (_????????????_) as not to give her up, when they and their children and their city were in such peril (ii. 118); and as regards the authority of Homer, some incidental passages in his poem show that he knew of Helen's sojourn in Egypt during the siege, but selected the other story as being a more suitable motive for an epic.  Similarly he does not believe that the Alcm?onid? family, a family who had always been the haters of tyranny (_????????????_), and to whom, even more than to Harmodios and Aristogeiton, Athens owed its liberty, would ever have been so treacherous as to hold up a shield after the battle of Marathon as a signal for the Persian host to fall on the city.  A shield, he acknowledges, was held up, but it could not possibly have been done by such friends of liberty as the house of Alcm?on; nor will he believe that a great king like Rhampsinitus would have sent his daughter _??????? ??? ?????????_.  Elsewhere he argues from more general considerations of probability; a Greek courtesan like Rhodopis would hardly have been rich enough to build a pyramid, and, besides, on chronological grounds the story is impossible (ii. 134).  In another passage (ii. 63), after giving an account of the forcible entry of the priests of Ares into the chapel of the god's mother, which seems to have been a sort of religious faction fight where sticks were freely used (_???? ??????? ???????_), ?I feel sure,? he says, ?that many of them died from getting their heads broken, notwithstanding the assertions of the Egyptian priests to the contrary.?  There is also something charmingly na?ve in the account he gives of the celebrated Greek swimmer who dived a distance of eighty stadia to give his countrymen warning of the Persian advance.  ?If, however,? he says, ?I may offer an opinion on the subject, I would say that he came in a boat.?  There is, of course, something a little trivial in some of the instances I have quoted; but in a writer like Herodotus, who stands on the borderland between faith and rationalism, one likes to note even the most minute instances of the rise of the critical and sceptical spirit of inquiry.  How really strange, at base, it was with him may, I think, be shown by a reference to those passages where he applies rationalistic tests to matters connected with religion.  He nowhere, indeed, grapples with the moral and scientific difficulties of the Greek Bible; and where he rejects as incredible the marvellous achievements of Hercules in Egypt, he does so on the express grounds that he had not yet been received among the gods, and so was still subject to the ordinary conditions of mortal life (_??? ???????? ?????_).  Even within these limits, however, his religious conscience seems to have been troubled at such daring rationalism, and the passage (ii. 45) concludes with a pious hope that God will pardon him for having gone so far, the great rationalistic passage being, of course, that in which he rejects the mythical account of the foundation of Dodona.  ?How can a dove speak with a human voice?? he asks, and rationalises the bird into a foreign princess.  Similarly he seems more inclined to believe that the great storm at the beginning of the Persian War ceased from ordinary atmospheric causes, and not in consequence of the incantations of the _Magians_.  He calls Melampos, whom the majority of the Greeks looked on as an inspired prophet, ?a clever man who had acquired for himself the art of prophecy?; and as regards the miracle told of the ?ginetan statues of the primeval deities of Damia and Auxesia, that they fell on their knees when the sacrilegious Athenians strove to carry them off, ?any one may believe it,? he says, ?who likes, but as for myself, I place no credence in the tale.?  So much then for the rationalistic spirit of historical criticism, as far as it appears explicitly in the works of this great and philosophic writer; but for an adequate appreciation of his position we must also note how conscious he was of the value of documentary evidence, of the use of inscriptions, of the importance of the poets as throwing light on manners and customs as well as on historical incidents.  No writer of any age has more vividly recognised the fact that history is a matter of evidence, and that it is as necessary for the historian to state his authority as it is to produce one's witnesses in a court of law.  While, however, we can discern in Herodotus the rise of an historic sense, we must not blind ourselves to the large amount of instances where he receives supernatural influences as part of the ordinary forces of life.  Compared to Thucydides, who succeeded him in the development of history, he appears almost like a medi?val writer matched with a modern rationalist.  For, contemporary though they were, between these two authors there is an infinite chasm of thought.  The essential difference of their methods may be best illustrated from those passages where they treat of the same subject.  The execution of the Spartan heralds, Nicolaos and Aneristos, during the Peloponnesian War is regarded by Herodotus as one of the most supernatural instances of the workings of nemesis and the wrath of an outraged hero; while the lengthened siege and ultimate fall of Troy was brought about by the avenging hand of God desiring to manifest unto men the mighty penalties which always follow upon mighty sins.  But Thucydides either sees not, or desires not to see, in either of these events the finger of Providence, or the punishment of wicked doers.  The death of the heralds is merely an Athenian retaliation for similar outrages committed by the opposite side; the long agony of the ten years? siege is due merely to the want of a good commissariat in the Greek army; while the fall of the city is the result of a united military attack consequent on a good supply of provisions.  Now, it is to be observed that in this latter passage, as well as elsewhere, Thucydides is in no sense of the word a sceptic as regards his attitude towards the truth of these ancient legends.  Agamemnon and Atreus, Theseus and Eurystheus, even Minos, about whom Herodotus has some doubts, are to him as real personages as Alcibiades or Gylippus.  The points in his historical criticism of the past are, first, his rejection of all extra-natural interference, and, secondly, the attributing to these ancient heroes the motives and modes of thought of his own day.  The present was to him the key to the explanation of the past, as it was to the prediction of the future.  Now, as regards his attitude towards the supernatural he is at one with modern science.  We too know that, just as the primeval coal-beds reveal to us the traces of rain-drops and other atmospheric phenomena similar to those of our own day, so, in estimating the history of the past, the introduction of no force must be allowed whose workings we cannot observe among the phenomena around us.  To lay down canons of ultra-historical credibility for the explanation of events which happen to have preceded us by a few thousand years, is as thoroughly unscientific as it is to intermingle preternatural in geological theories.  Whatever the canons of art may be, no difficulty in history is so great as to warrant the introduction of a spirit of spirit _???? ??? ???????_, in the sense of a violation of the laws of nature.  Upon the other point, however, Thucydides falls into an anachronism.  To refuse to allow the workings of chivalrous and self-denying motives among the knights of the Trojan crusade, because he saw none in the faction-loving Athenian of his own day, is to show an entire ignorance of the various characteristics of human nature developing under different circumstances, and to deny to a primitive chieftain like Agamemnon that authority founded on opinion, to which we give the name of divine right, is to fall into an historical error quite as gross as attributing to Atreus the courting of the populace (_????????????? ??? ?????_) with a view to the Mycenean throne.  The general method of historical criticism pursued by Thucydides having been thus indicated, it remains to proceed more into detail as regards those particular points where he claims for himself a more rational method of estimating evidence than either the public or his predecessors possessed.  ?So little pains,? he remarks, ?do the vulgar take in the investigation of truth, satisfied with their preconceived opinions,? that the majority of the Greeks believe in a Pitanate cohort of the Spartan army and in a double vote being the prerogative of the Spartan kings, neither of which opinions has any foundation in fact.  But the chief point on which he lays stress as evincing the ?uncritical way with which men receive legends, even the legends of their own country,? is the entire baselessness of the common Athenian tradition in which Harmodios and Aristogeiton were represented as the patriotic liberators of Athens from the Peisistratid tyranny.  So far, he points out, from the love of freedom being their motive, both of them were influenced by merely personal considerations, Aristogeiton being jealous of Hipparchos? attention to Harmodios, then a beautiful boy in the flower of Greek loveliness, while the latter's indignation was aroused by an insult offered to his sister by the prince.  Their motives, then, were personal revenge, while the result of their conspiracy served only to rivet more tightly the chains of servitude which bound Athens to the Peisistratid house, for Hipparchos, whom they killed, was only the tyrant's younger brother, and not the tyrant himself.  To prove his theory that Hippias was the elder, he appeals to the evidence afforded by a public inscription in which his name occurs immediately after that of his father, a point which he thinks shows that he was the eldest, and so the heir.  This view he further corroborates by another inscription, on the altar of Apollo, which mentions the children of Hippias and not those of his brothers; ?for it was natural for the eldest to be married first?; and besides this, on the score of general probability he points out that, had Hippias been the younger, he would not have so easily obtained the tyranny on the death of Hipparchos.  Now, what is important in Thucydides, as evinced in the treatment of legend generally, is not the results he arrived at, but the method by which he works.  The first great rationalistic historian, he may be said to have paved the way for all those who followed after him, though it must always be remembered that, while the total absence in his pages of all the mystical paraphernalia of the supernatural theory of life is an advance in the progress of rationalism, and an era in scientific history, whose importance could never be over-estimated, yet we find along with it a total absence of any mention of those various social and economical forces which form such important factors in the evolution of the world, and to which Herodotus rightly gave great prominence in his immortal work.  The history of Thucydides is essentially one-sided and incomplete. The intricate details of sieges and battles, subjects with which the historian proper has really nothing to do except so far as they may throw light on the spirit of the age, we would readily exchange for some notice of the condition of private society in Athens, or the influence and position of women.  There is an advance in the method of historical criticism; there is an advance in the conception and motive of history itself; for in Thucydides we may discern that natural reaction against the intrusion of didactic and theological considerations into the sphere of the pure intellect, the spirit of which may be found in the Euripidean treatment of tragedy and the later schools of art, as well as in the Platonic conception of science.  History, no doubt, has splendid lessons for our instruction, just as all good art comes to us as the herald of the noblest truth.  But, to set before either the painter or the historian the inculcation of moral lessons as an aim to be consciously pursued, is to miss entirely the true motive and characteristic both of art and history, which is in the one case the creation of beauty, in the other the discovery of the laws of the evolution of progress: _Il ne faut demander de l?Art que l?Art_, _du pass? que le pass?_.  Herodotus wrote to illustrate the wonderful ways of Providence and the nemesis that falls on sin, and his work is a good example of the truth that nothing can dispense with criticism so much as a moral aim. Thucydides has no creed to preach, no doctrine to prove.  He analyses the results which follow inevitably from certain antecedents, in order that on a recurrence of the same crisis men may know how to act.  His object was to discover the laws of the past so as to serve as a light to illumine the future.  We must not confuse the recognition of the utility of history with any ideas of a didactic aim.  Two points more in Thucydides remain for our consideration: his treatment of the rise of Greek civilisation, and of the primitive condition of Hellas, as well as the question how far can he be said really to have recognised the existence of laws regulating the complex phenomena of life.  THE investigation into the two great problems of the origin of society and the philosophy of history occupies such an important position in the evolution of Greek thought that, to obtain any clear view of the workings of the critical spirit, it will be necessary to trace at some length their rise and scientific development as evinced not merely in the works of historians proper, but also in the philosophical treatises of Plato and Aristotle.  The important position which these two great thinkers occupy in the progress of historical criticism can hardly be over-estimated.  I do not mean merely as regards their treatment of the Greek Bible, and Plato's endeavours to purge sacred history of its immorality by the application of ethical canons at the time when Aristotle was beginning to undermine the basis of miracles by his scientific conception of law, but with reference to these two wider questions of the rise of civil institutions and the philosophy of history.  And first, as regards the current theories of the primitive condition of society, there was a wide divergence of opinion in Hellenic society, just as there is now.  For while the majority of the orthodox public, of whom Hesiod may be taken as the representative, looked back, as a great many of our own day still do, to a fabulous age of innocent happiness, a _bell? et? dell? auro_, where sin and death were unknown and men and women were like Gods, the foremost men of intellect such as Aristotle and Plato, 'schylus and many of the other poets {29} saw in primitive man ?a few small sparks of humanity preserved on the tops of mountains after some deluge,? ?without an idea of cities, governments or legislation,? ?living the lives of wild beasts in sunless caves,? ?their only law being the survival of the fittest.?  And this, too, was the opinion of Thucydides, whose _Arch?ologia_ as it is contains a most valuable disquisition on the early condition of Hellas, which it will be necessary to examine at some length.  Now, as regards the means employed generally by Thucydides for the elucidation of ancient history, I have already pointed out how that, while acknowledging that ?it is the tendency of every poet to exaggerate, as it is of every chronicler to seek to be attractive at the expense of truth,? he yet assumes in the thoroughly euhemeristic way, that under the veil of myth and legend there does yet exist a rational basis of fact discoverable by the method of rejecting all supernatural interference as well as any extraordinary motives influencing the actors.  It is in complete accordance with this spirit that he appeals, for instance, to the Homeric epithet of _???????_, as applied to Corinth, as a proof of the early commercial prosperity of that city; to the fact of the generic name _Hellenes_ not occurring in the _Iliad_ as a corroboration of his theory of the essentially disunited character of the primitive Greek tribes; and he argues from the line ?O?er many islands and all Argos ruled,? |2
40|as applied to Agamemnon, that his forces must have been partially naval, ?for Agamemnon's was a continental power, and he could not have been master of any but the adjacent islands, and these would not be many but through the possession of a fleet.?  Anticipating in some measure the comparative method of research, he argues from the fact of the more barbarous Greek tribes, such as the ?tolians and Acarnanians, still carrying arms in his own day, that this custom was the case originally over the whole country.  ?The fact,? he says, ?that the people in these parts of Hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life was equally common to all.?  Similarly, in another passage, he shows how a corroboration of his theory of the respectable character of piracy in ancient days is afforded by ?the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still regard a successful marauder,? as well as by the fact that the question, ?Are you a pirate?? is a common feature of primitive society as shown in the poets; and finally, after observing how the old Greek custom of wearing belts in gymnastic contests still survived among the more uncivilised Asiatic tribes, he observes that there are many other points in which a likeness may be shown between the life of the primitive Hellenes and that of the barbarians to-day.?  As regards the evidence afforded by ancient remains, while adducing as a proof of the insecure character of early Greek society the fact of their cities {31} being always built at some distance from the sea, yet he is careful to warn us, and the caution ought to be borne in mind by all arch?ologists, that we have no right to conclude from the scanty remains of any city that its legendary greatness in primitive times was a mere exaggeration.  ?We are not justified,? he says, ?in rejecting the tradition of the magnitude of the Trojan armament, because Mycen? and the other towns of that age seem to us small and insignificant.  For, if Laced?mon was to become desolate, any antiquarian judging merely from its ruins would be inclined to regard the tale of the Spartan hegemony as an idle myth; for the city is a mere collection of villages after the old fashion of Hellas, and has none of those splendid public buildings and temples which characterise Athens, and whose remains, in the case of the latter city, would be so marvellous as to lead the superficial observer into an exaggerated estimate of the Athenian power.?  Nothing can be more scientific than the arch?ological canons laid down, whose truth is strikingly illustrated to any one who has compared the waste fields of the Eurotas plain with the lordly monuments of the Athenian acropolis. {32}  On the other hand, Thucydides is quite conscious of the value of the positive evidence afforded by arch?ological remains.  He appeals, for instance, to the character of the armour found in the Delian tombs and the peculiar mode of sepulture, as corroboration of his theory of the predominance of the Carian element among the primitive islanders, and to the concentration of all the temples either in the Acropolis, or in its immediate vicinity, to the name of _????_ by which it was still known, and to the extraordinary sanctity of the spring of water there, as proof that the primitive city was originally confined to the citadel, and the district immediately beneath it (ii. 16).  And lastly, in the very opening of his history, anticipating one of the most scientific of modern methods, he points out how in early states of civilisation immense fertility of the soil tends to favour the personal aggrandisement of individuals, and so to stop the normal progress of the country through ?the rise of factions, that endless source of ruin?; and also by the allurements it offers to a foreign invader, to necessitate a continual change of population, one immigration following on another.  He exemplifies his theory by pointing to the endless political revolutions that characterised Arcadia, Thessaly and Boeotia, the three richest spots in Greece, as well as by the negative instance of the undisturbed state in primitive time of Attica, which was always remarkable for the dryness and poverty of its soil.  Now, while undoubtedly in these passages we may recognise the first anticipation of many of the most modern principles of research, we must remember how essentially limited is the range of the _arch?ologia_, and how no theory at all is offered on the wider questions of the general conditions of the rise and progress of humanity, a problem which is first scientifically discussed in the _Republic_ of Plato.  And at the outset it must be premised that, while the study of primitive man is an essentially inductive science, resting rather on the accumulation of evidence than on speculation, among the Greeks it was prosecuted rather on deductive principles.  Thucydides did, indeed, avail himself of the opportunities afforded by the unequal development of civilisation in his own day in Greece, and in the places I have pointed out seems to have anticipated the comparative method.  But we do not find later writers availing themselves of the wonderfully accurate and picturesque accounts given by Herodotus of the customs of savage tribes. To take one instance, which bears a good deal on modern questions, we find in the works of this great traveller the gradual and progressive steps in the development of the family life clearly manifested in the mere gregarious herding together of the Agathyrsi, their primitive kinsmanship through women in common, and the rise of a feeling of paternity from a state of polyandry.  This tribe stood at that time on that borderland between umbilical relationship and the family which has been such a difficult point for modern anthropologists to find.  The ancient authors, however, are unanimous in insisting that the family is the ultimate unit of society, though, as I have said, an inductive study of primitive races, or even the accounts given of them by Herodotus, would have shown them that the _??????? ????_ of a personal household, to use Plato's expression, is really a most complex notion appearing always in a late stage of civilisation, along with recognition of private property and the rights of individualism.  Philology also, which in the hands of modern investigators has proved such a splendid instrument of research, was in ancient days studied on principles too unscientific to be of much use.  Herodotus points out that the word _Eridanos_ is essentially Greek in character, that consequently the river supposed to run round the world is probably a mere Greek invention.  His remarks, however, on language generally, as in the case of _Piromis_ and the ending of the Persian names, show on what unsound basis his knowledge of language rested.  In the _Bacch?_ of Euripides there is an extremely interesting passage in which the immoral stories of the Greek mythology are accounted for on the principle of that misunderstanding of words and metaphors to which modern science has given the name of a disease of language.  In answer to the impious rationalism of Pentheus?a sort of modern Philistine?Teiresias, who may be termed the Max M?ller of the Theban cycle, points out that the story of Dionysus being inclosed in Zeus? thigh really arose from the linguistic confusion between _?????_ and _??????_.  On the whole, however?for I have quoted these two instances only to show the unscientific character of early philology?we may say that this important instrument in recreating the history of the past was not really used by the ancients as a means of historical criticism.  Nor did the ancients employ that other method, used to such advantage in our own day, by which in the symbolism and formulas of an advanced civilisation we can detect the unconscious survival of ancient customs: for, whereas in the sham capture of the bride at a marriage feast, which was common in Wales till a recent time, we can discern the lingering reminiscence of the barbarous habit of exogamy, the ancient writers saw only the deliberate commemoration of an historical event.  Aristotle does not tell us by what method he discovered that the Greeks used to buy their wives in primitive times, but, judging by his general principles, it was probably through some legend or myth on the subject which lasted to his own day, and not, as we would do, by arguing back from the marriage presents given to the bride and her relatives. {37}  The origin of the common proverb ?worth so many beeves,? in which we discern the unconscious survival of a purely pastoral state of society before the use of metals was known, is ascribed by Plutarch to the fact of Theseus having coined money bearing a bull's head.  Similarly, the Amathusian festival, in which a young man imitated the labours of a woman in travail, is regarded by him as a rite instituted in Ariadne's honour, and the Carian adoration of asparagus as a simple commemoration of the adventure of the nymph Perigune.  In the first of these _we_ discern the beginning of agnation and kinsmanship through the father, which still lingers in the ?couvee? of New Zealand tribes: while the second is a relic of the totem and fetish worship of plants.  Now, in entire opposition to this modern inductive principle of research stands the philosophic Plato, whose account of primitive man is entirely speculative and deductive.  The origin of society he ascribes to necessity, the mother of all inventions, and imagines that individual man began deliberately to herd together on account of the advantages of the principle of division of labour and the rendering of mutual need.  It must, however, be borne in mind that Plato's object in this whole passage in the _Republic_ was, perhaps, not so much to analyse the conditions of early society as to illustrate the importance of the division of labour, the shibboleth of his political economy, by showing what a powerful factor it must have been in the most primitive as well as in the most complex states of society; just as in the _Laws_ he almost rewrites entirely the history of the Peloponnesus in order to prove the necessity of a balance of power.  He surely, I mean, must have recognised himself how essentially incomplete his theory was in taking no account of the origin of family life, the position and influence of women, and other social questions, as well as in disregarding those deeper motives of religion, which are such important factors in early civilisation, and whose influence Aristotle seems to have clearly apprehended, when he says that the aim of primitive society was not merely life but the higher life, and that in the origin of society utility is not the sole motive, but that there is something spiritual in it if, at least, 'spiritual? will bring out the meaning of that complex expression _?? ?????_. Otherwise, the whole account in the _Republic_ of primitive man will always remain as a warning against the intrusion of _a priori_ speculations in the domain appropriate to induction.  Now, Aristotle's theory of the origin of society, like his philosophy of ethics, rests ultimately on the principle of final causes, not in the theological meaning of an aim or tendency imposed from without, but in the scientific sense of function corresponding to organ.  ?Nature maketh no thing in vain? is the text of Aristotle in this as in other inquiries. Man being the only animal possessed of the power of rational speech is, he asserts, by nature intended to be social, more so than the bee or any other gregarious animal.  He is _????? ?????????_, and the national tendency towards higher forms of perfection brings the ?armed savage who used to sell his wife? to the free independence of a free state, and to the _?????? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ????????_, which was the test of true citizenship.  The stages passed through by humanity start with the family first as the ultimate unit.  The conglomeration of families forms a village ruled by that patriarchal sway which is the oldest form of government in the world, as is shown by the fact that all men count it to be the constitution of heaven, and the villages are merged into the state, and here the progression stops.  For Aristotle, like all Greek thinkers, found his ideal within the walls of the _?????_, yet perhaps in his remark that a united Greece would rule the world we may discern some anticipation of that ?federal union of free states into one consolidated empire? which, more than the _?????_, is to our eyes the ultimately perfect polity.  How far Aristotle was justified in regarding the family as the ultimate unit, with the materials afforded to him by Greek literature, I have already noticed.  Besides, Aristotle, I may remark, had he reflected on the meaning of that Athenian law which, while prohibiting marriage with a uterine sister, permitted it with a sister-german, or on the common tradition in Athens that before the time of Cecrops children bore their mothers? names, or on some of the Spartan regulations, could hardly have failed to see the universality of kinsmanship through women in early days, and the late appearance of monandry.  Yet, while he missed this point, in common, it must be acknowledged, with many modern writers, such as Sir Henry Maine, it is essentially as an explorer of inductive instances that we recognise his improvement on Plato.  The treatise _???? ?????????_, did it remain to us in its entirety, would have been one of the most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism, and the first scientific treatise on the science of comparative politics.  A few fragments still remain to us, in one of which we find Aristotle appealing to the authority of an ancient inscription on the ?Disk of Iphitus,? one of the most celebrated Greek antiquities, to corroborate his theory of the Lycurgean revival of the Olympian festival; while his enormous research is evinced in the elaborate explanation he gives of the historical origin of proverbs such as _?????? ????? ????? ?????_, of religious songs like the _????? ?? ??????_ of the Botticean virgins, or the praises of love and war.  And, finally, it is to be observed how much wider than Plato's his theory of the origin of society is.  They both rest on a psychological basis, but Aristotle's recognition of the capacity for progress and the tendency towards a higher life shows how much deeper his knowledge of human nature was.  In imitation of these two philosophers, Polybius gives an account of the origin of society in the opening to his philosophy of history.  Somewhat in the spirit of Plato, he imagines that after one of the cyclic deluges which sweep off mankind at stated periods and annihilate all pre-existing civilisation, the few surviving members of humanity coalesce for mutual protection, and, as in the case with ordinary animals, the one most remarkable for physical strength is elected king.  In a short time, owing to the workings of sympathy and the desire of approbation, the moral qualities begin to make their appearance, and intellectual instead of bodily excellence becomes the qualification for sovereignty.  Other points, as the rise of law and the like, are dwelt on in a somewhat modern spirit, and although Polybius seems not to have employed the inductive method of research in this question, or rather, I should say, of the hierarchical order of the rational progress of ideas in life, he is not far removed from what the laborious investigations of modern travellers have given us.  And, indeed, as regards the working of the speculative faculty in the creation of history, it is in all respects marvellous how that the most truthful accounts of the passage from barbarism to civilisation in ancient literature come from the works of poets.  The elaborate researches of Mr. Tylor and Sir John Lubbock have done little more than verify the theories put forward in the _Prometheus Bound_ and the _De Natura Rerum_; yet neither 'schylus nor Lucretias followed in the modern path, but rather attained to truth by a certain almost mystic power of creative imagination, such as we now seek to banish from science as a dangerous power, though to it science seems to owe many of its most splendid generalities. {43}  Leaving then the question of the origin of society as treated by the ancients, I shall now turn to the other and the more important question of how far they may he said to have attained to what we call the philosophy of history.  Now at the outset we must note that, while the conceptions of law and order have been universally received as the governing principles of the phenomena of nature in the sphere of physical science, yet their intrusion into the domain of history and the life of man has always been met with a strong opposition, on the ground of the incalculable nature of two great forces acting on human action, a certain causeless spontaneity which men call free will, and the extra-natural interference which they attribute as a constant attribute to God.  Now, that there is a science of the apparently variable phenomena of history is a conception which _we_ have perhaps only recently begun to appreciate; yet, like all other great thoughts, it seems to have come to the Greek mind spontaneously, through a certain splendour of imagination, in the morning tide of their civilisation, before inductive research had armed them with the instruments of verification.  For I think it is possible to discern in some of the mystic speculations of the early Greek thinkers that desire to discover what is that ?invariable existence of which there are variable states,? and to incorporate it in some one formula of law which may serve to explain the different manifestations of all organic bodies, _man included_, which is the germ of the philosophy of history; the germ indeed of an idea of which it is not too much to say that on it any kind of historical criticism, worthy of the name, must ultimately rest.  For the very first requisite for any scientific conception of history is the doctrine of uniform sequence: in other words, that certain events having happened, certain other events corresponding to them will happen also; that the past is the key of the future.  Now at the birth of this great conception science, it is true, presided, yet religion it was which at the outset clothed it in its own garb, and familiarised men with it by appealing to their hearts first and then to their intellects; knowing that at the beginning of things it is through the moral nature, and not through the intellectual, that great truths are spread.  So in Herodotus, who may be taken as a representative of the orthodox tone of thought, the idea of the uniform sequence of cause and effect appears under the theological aspect of Nemesis and Providence, which is really the scientific conception of law, only it is viewed from an _ethical_ standpoint.  Now in Thucydides the philosophy of history rests on the probability, which the uniformity of human nature affords us, that the future will in the course of human things resemble the past, if not reproduce it.  He appears to contemplate a recurrence of the phenomena of history as equally certain with a return of the epidemic of the Great Plague.  Notwithstanding what German critics have written on the subject, we must beware of regarding this conception as a mere reproduction of that cyclic theory of events which sees in the world nothing but the regular rotation of Strophe and Antistrophe, in the eternal choir of life and death.  For, in his remarks on the excesses of the Corcyrean Revolution, Thucydides distinctly rests his idea of the recurrence of history on the psychological grounds of the general sameness of mankind.  ?The sufferings,? he says, ?which revolution entailed upon the cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always will occurs as long as human nature remains the same, though in a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the particular cases.  ?In peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments, because they are not confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes away the easy supply of men's wants, and so proves a hard taskmaster, which brings most men's characters to a level with their fortunes.?  IT is evident that here Thucydides is ready to admit the variety of manifestations which external causes bring about in their workings on the uniform character of the nature of man.  Yet, after all is said, these are perhaps but very general statements: the ordinary effects of peace and war are dwelt on, but there is no real analysis of the immediate causes and general laws of the phenomena of life, nor does Thucydides seem to recognise the truth that if humanity proceeds in circles, the circles are always widening.  Perhaps we may say that with him the philosophy of history is partly in the metaphysical stage, and see, in the progress of this idea from Herodotus to Polybius, the exemplification of the Comtian Law of the three stages of thought, the theological, the metaphysical, and the scientific: for truly out of the vagueness of theological mysticism this conception which we call the Philosophy of History was raised to a scientific principle, according to which the past was explained and the future predicted by reference to general laws.  Now, just as the earliest account of the nature of the progress of humanity is to be found in Plato, so in him we find the first explicit attempt to found a universal philosophy of history upon wide rational grounds.  Having created an ideally perfect state, the philosopher proceeds to give an elaborate theory of the complex causes which produce revolutions, of the moral effects of various forms of government and education, of the rise of the criminal classes and their connection with pauperism, and, in a word, to create history by the deductive method and to proceed from _a priori_ psychological principles to discover the governing laws of the apparent chaos of political life.  There have been many attempts since Plato to deduce from a single philosophical principle all the phenomena which experience subsequently verifies for us.  Fichte thought he could predict the world-plan from the idea of universal time.  Hegel dreamed he had found the key to the mysteries of life in the development of freedom, and Krause in the categories of being.  But the one scientific basis on which the true philosophy of history must rest is the complete knowledge of the laws of human nature in all its wants, its aspirations, its powers and its tendencies: and this great truth, which Thucydides may be said in some measure to have apprehended, was given to us first by Plato.  Now, it cannot be accurately said of this philosopher that either his philosophy or his history is entirely and simply _a priori_.  _On est de son si?cle m?me quand on y proteste_, and so we find in him continual references to the Spartan mode of life, the Pythagorean system, the general characteristics of Greek tyrannies and Greek democracies.  For while, in his account of the method of forming an ideal state, he says that the political artist is indeed to fix his gaze on the sun of abstract truth in the heavens of the pure reason, but is sometimes to turn to the realisation of the ideals on earth: yet, after all, the general character of the Platonic method, which is what we are specially concerned with, is essentially deductive and _a priori_.  And he himself, in the building up of his Nephelococcygia, certainly starts with a _??????? ?????_, making a clean sweep of all history and all experience; and it was essentially as an _a priori_ theorist that he is criticised by Aristotle, as we shall see later.  To proceed to closer details regarding the actual scheme of the laws of political revolutions as drawn out by Plato, we must first note that the primary cause of the decay of the ideal state is the general principle, common to the vegetable and animal worlds as well as to the world of history, that all created things are fated to decay?a principle which, though expressed in the terms of a mere metaphysical abstraction, is yet perhaps in its essence scientific.  For we too must hold that a continuous redistribution of matter and motion is the inevitable result of the nominal persistence of Force, and that perfect equilibrium is as impossible in politics as it certainly is in physics.  The secondary causes which mar the perfection of the Platonic ?city of the sun? are to be found in the intellectual decay of the race consequent on injudicious marriages and in the Philistine elevation of physical achievements over mental culture; while the hierarchical succession of Timocracy and Oligarchy, Democracy and Tyranny, is dwelt on at great length and its causes analysed in a very dramatic and psychological manner, if not in that sanctioned by the actual order of history.  And indeed it is apparent at first sight that the Platonic succession of states represents rather the succession of ideas in the philosophic mind than any historical succession of time.  Aristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts.  If the theory of the periodic decay of all created things, he urges, be scientific, it must be universal, and so true of all the other states as well as of the ideal.  Besides, a state usually changes into its contrary and not to the form next to it; so the ideal state would not change into Timocracy; while Oligarchy, more often than Tyranny, succeeds Democracy.  Plato, besides, says nothing of what a Tyranny would change to.  According to the cycle theory it ought to pass into the ideal state again, but as a fact one Tyranny is changed into another as at Sicyon, or into a Democracy as at Syracuse, or into an Aristocracy as at Carthage.  The example of Sicily, too, shows that an Oligarchy is often followed by a Tyranny, as at Leontini and Gela.  Besides, it is absurd to represent greed as the chief motive of decay, or to talk of avarice as the root of Oligarchy, when in nearly all true oligarchies money-making is forbidden by law.  And finally the Platonic theory neglects the different kinds of democracies and of tyrannies.  Now nothing can be more important than this passage in Aristotle's _Politics_ (_v._ 12.), which may he said to mark an era in the evolution of historical criticism.  For there is nothing on which Aristotle insists so strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be added to the data of the _a priori_ method?a principle which we know to be true not merely of deductive speculative politics but of physics also: for are not the residual phenomena of chemists a valuable source of improvement in theory?  His own method is essentially historical though by no means empirical. On the contrary, this far-seeing thinker, rightly styled _il maestro di color che sanno_, may be said to have apprehended clearly that the true method is neither exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative, but rather a union of both in the process called Analysis or the Interpretation of Facts, which has been defined as the application to facts of such general conceptions as may fix the important characteristics of the phenomena, and present them permanently in their true relations.  He too was the first to point out, what even in our own day is incompletely appreciated, that nature, including the development of man, is not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy, that inconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they are in the physical world, and that where the superficial observer thinks he sees a revolution the philosophical critic discerns merely the gradual and rational evolution of the inevitable results of certain antecedents.  And while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for the philosophy of history, he added to it the important truth that man, to be apprehended in his proper position in the universe as well as in his natural powers, must be studied from below in the hierarchical progression of higher function from the lower forms of life.  The important maxim, that to obtain a clear conception of anything we must 'study it in its growth from the very beginning,? is formally set down in the opening of the _Politics_, where, indeed, we shall find the other characteristic features of the modern Evolutionary theory, such as the ?Differentiation of Function? and the ?Survival of t|2
41|he Fittest? explicitly set forth.  What a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method of historical criticism it is needless to point out.  By it, one may say, the true thread was given to guide one's steps through the bewildering labyrinth of facts.  For history (to use terms with which Aristotle has made us familiar) may be looked at from two essentially different standpoints; either as a work of art whose _?????_ or final cause is external to it and imposed on it from without; or as an organism containing the law of its own development in itself, and working out its perfection merely by the fact of being what it is.  Now, if we adopt the former, which we may style the theological view, we shall be in continual danger of tripping into the pitfall of some _a priori_ conclusion?that bourne from which, it has been truly said, no traveller ever returns.  The latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended in its fulness by Aristotle, whose application of the inductive method to history, and whose employment of the evolutionary theory of humanity, show that he was conscious that the philosophy of history is nothing separate from the facts of history but is contained in them, and that the rational law of the complex phenomena of life, like the ideal in the world of thought, is to be reached through the facts, not superimposed on them?_???? ??????_ not _???? ?????_.  And finally, in estimating the enormous debt which the science of historical criticism owes to Aristotle, we must not pass over his attitude towards those two great difficulties in the formation of a philosophy of history on which I have touched above.  I mean the assertion of extra-natural interference with the normal development of the world and of the incalculable influence exercised by the power of free will.  Now, as regards the former, he may be said to have neglected it entirely. The special acts of providence proceeding from God's immediate government of the world, which Herodotus saw as mighty landmarks in history, would have been to him essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign of law, the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers of antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise.  Standing aloof from the popular religion as well as from the deeper conceptions of Herodotus and the Tragic School, he no longer thought of God as of one with fair limbs and treacherous face haunting wood and glade, nor would he see in him a jealous judge continually interfering in the world's history to bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a fall.  God to him was the incarnation of the pure Intellect, a being whose activity was the contemplation of his own perfection, one whom Philosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move, to the sublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were the sons of men, their desires or their sins?  While, as regards the other difficulty and the formation of a philosophy of history, the conflict of free will with general laws appears first in Greek thought in the usual theological form in which all great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth.  It was such legends as those of ?dipus and Adrastus, exemplifying the struggles of individual humanity against the overpowering force of circumstances and necessity, which gave to the early Greeks those same lessons which we of modern days draw, in somewhat less artistic fashion, from the study of statistics and the laws of physiology.  In Aristotle, of course, there is no trace of supernatural influence. The Furies, which drive their victim into sin first and then punishment, are no longer ?viper-tressed goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame,? but those evil thoughts which harbour within the impure soul.  In this, as in all other points, to arrive at Aristotle is to reach the pure atmosphere of scientific and modern thought.  But while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form as essentially a _reductio ad absurdum_ of life, he was fully conscious of the fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force beyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is inconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from the first, continually influenced by habits, education and circumstance; so absolutely modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike seem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to sin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation.  And of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the nature of man (a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern days when the ?race theory? is supposed to be a sufficient explanation of the Hindoo, and the latitude and longitude of a country the best guide to its morals {57}) Aristotle is completely unaware.  I do not allude to such smaller points as the oligarchical tendencies of a horse-breeding country and the democratic influence of the proximity of the sea (important though they are for the consideration of Greek history), but rather to those wider views in the seventh book of his _Politics_, where he attributes the happy union in the Greek character of intellectual attainments with the spirit of progress to the temperate climate they enjoyed, and points out how the extreme cold of the north dulls the mental faculties of its inhabitants and renders them incapable of social organisation or extended empire; while to the enervating heat of eastern countries was due that want of spirit and bravery which then, as now, was the characteristic of the population in that quarter of the globe.  Thucydides has shown the causal connection between political revolutions and the fertility of the soil, but goes a step farther and points out the psychological influences on a people's character exercised by the various extremes of climate?in both cases the first appearance of a most valuable form of historical criticism.  To the development of Dialectic, as to God, intervals of time are of no account.  From Plato and Aristotle we pass direct to Polybius.  The progress of thought from the philosopher of the Academe to the Arcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of the method by which each of the three writers, whom I have selected as the highest expression of the rationalism of his respective age, attained to his ideal state: for the latter conception may be in a measure regarded as representing the most spiritual principle which they could discern in history.  Now, Plato created his on _a priori_ principles; Aristotle formed his by an analysis of existing constitutions; Polybius found his realised for him in the actual world of fact.  Aristotle criticised the deductive speculations of Plato by means of inductive negative instances, but Polybius will not take the ?Cloud City? of the _Republic_ into account at all.  He compares it to an athlete who has never run on ?Constitution Hill,? to a statue so beautiful that it is entirely removed from the ordinary conditions of humanity, and consequently from the canons of criticism.  The Roman state had attained in his eyes, by means of the mutual counteraction of three opposing forces, {59} that stable equilibrium in politics which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of antiquity. And in connection with this point it will be convenient to notice here how much truth there is contained in the accusation often brought against the ancients that they knew nothing of the idea of Progress, for the meaning of many of their speculations will be hidden from us if we do not try and comprehend first what their aim was, and secondly why it was so.  Now, like all wide generalities, this statement is at least inaccurate. The prayer of Plato's ideal City?_?? ?????? ????????_, _??? ?? ???????? ????????????? ??? ???? ???????? ?????????_, might be written as a text over the door of the last Temple to Humanity raised by the disciples of Fourier and Saint-Simon, but it is certainly true that their ideal principle was order and permanence, not indefinite progress.  For, setting aside the artistic prejudices which would have led the Greeks to reject this idea of unlimited improvement, we may note that the modern conception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and worship of humanity, partly on the splendid hopes of material improvements in civilisation which applied science has held out to us, two influences from which ancient Greek thought seems to have been strangely free.  For the Greeks marred the perfect humanism of the great men whom they worshipped, by imputing to them divinity and its supernatural powers; while their science was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in its character, aiming at culture and not utility, at higher spirituality and more intense reverence for law, rather than at the increased facilities of locomotion and the cheap production of common things about which our modern scientific school ceases not to boast.  And lastly, and perhaps chiefly, we must remember that the ?plague spot of all Greek states,? as one of their own writers has called it, was the terrible insecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions and revolutions which ceased not to trouble Greece at all times, raising a spirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the middle ages of Europe.  These considerations, then, will enable us to understand first how it was that, radical and unscrupulous reformers as the Greek political theorists were, yet, their end once attained, no modern conservatives raised such outcry against the slightest innovation.  Even acknowledged improvements in such things as the games of children or the modes of music were regarded by them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of the _drapeau rouge_ of reform.  And secondly, it will show us how it was that Polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth of Rome, and Aristotle, like Mr. Bright, in the middle classes.  Polybius, however, is not content merely with pointing out his ideal state, but enters at considerable length into the question of those general laws whose consideration forms the chief essential of the philosophy of history.  He starts by accepting the general principle that all things are fated to decay (which I noticed in the case of Plato), and that ?as iron produces rust and as wood breeds the animals that destroy it, so every state has in it the seeds of its own corruption.?  He is not, however, content to rest there, but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of revolutions, which he says are twofold in nature, either external or internal.  Now, the former, depending as they do on the synchronous conjunction of other events outside the sphere of scientific estimation, are from their very character incalculable; but the latter, though assuming many forms, always result from the over-great preponderance of any single element to the detriment of the others, the rational law lying at the base of all varieties of political changes being that stability can result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the counteraction of opposing parts, since the more simple a constitution is the more it is insecure.  Plato had pointed out before how the extreme liberty of a democracy always resulted in despotism, but Polybius analyses the law and shows the scientific principles on which it rests.  The doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an important era in the philosophy of history.  Its special applicability to the politics of our own day has been illustrated in the rise of the great Napoleon, when the French state had lost those divisions of caste and prejudice, of landed aristocracy and moneyed interest, institutions in which the vulgar see only barriers to Liberty but which are indeed the only possible defences against the coming of that periodic Sirius of politics, the _???????? ?? ??????????? ?????_.  There is a principle which Tocqueville never wearies of explaining, and which has been subsumed by Mr. Herbert Spencer under that general law common to all organic bodies which we call the Instability of the Homogeneous.  The various manifestations of this law, as shown in the normal, regular revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of government, {63a} are expounded with great clearness by Polybius, who claimed for his theory, in the Thucydidean spirit, that it is a _????? ?? ???_, not a mere _???????? ?? ?? ?????????_, and that a knowledge of it will enable the impartial observer {63b} to discover at any time what period of its constitutional evolution any particular state has already reached and into what form it will be next differentiated, though possibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less uncertain. {63c}  Now in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of political revolutions as expounded by Polybius enough perhaps has been said to show what is his true position in the rational development of the ?Idea? which I have called the Philosophy of History, because it is the unifying of history.  Seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion in the pages of Herodotus, more metaphysical than scientific with Thucydides, Plato strove to seize it by the eagle-flight of speculation, to reach it with the eager grasp of a soul impatient of those slower and surer inductive methods which Aristotle, in his trenchant criticism of his greater master, showed were more brilliant than any vague theory, if the test of brilliancy is truth.  What then is the position of Polybius?  Does any new method remain for him?  Polybius was one of those many men who are born too late to be original.  To Thucydides belongs the honour of being the first in the history of Greek thought to discern the supreme calm of law and order underlying the fitful storms of life, and Plato and Aristotle each represents a great new principle.  To Polybius belongs the office?how noble an office he made it his writings show?of making more explicit the ideas which were implicit in his predecessors, of showing that they were of wider applicability and perhaps of deeper meaning than they had seemed before, of examining with more minuteness the laws which they had discovered, and finally of pointing out more clearly than any one had done the range of science and the means it offered for analysing the present and predicting what was to come.  His office thus was to gather up what they had left, to give their principles new life by a wider application.  Polybius ends this great diapason of Greek thought.  When the Philosophy of history appears next, as in Plutarch's tract on ?Why God's anger is delayed,? the pendulum of thought had swung back to where it began.  His theory was introduced to the Romans under the cultured style of Cicero, and was welcomed by them as the philosophical panegyric of their state. The last notice of it in Latin literature is in the pages of Tacitus, who alludes to the stable polity formed out of these elements as a constitution easier to commend than to produce and in no case lasting. Yet Polybius had seen the future with no uncertain eye, and had prophesied the rise of the Empire from the unbalanced power of the ochlocracy fifty years and more before there was joy in the Julian household over the birth of that boy who, born to power as the champion of the people, died wearing the purple of a king.  No attitude of historical criticism is more important than the means by which the ancients attained to the philosophy of history.  The principle of heredity can be exemplified in literature as well as in organic life: Aristotle, Plato and Polybius are the lineal ancestors of Fichte and Hegel, of Vico and Cousin, of Montesquieu and Tocqueville.  As my aim is not to give an account of historians but to point out those great thinkers whose methods have furthered the advance of this spirit of historical criticism, I shall pass over those annalists and chroniclers who intervened between Thucydides and Polybius.  Yet perhaps it may serve to throw new light on the real nature of this spirit and its intimate connection with all other forms of advanced thought if I give some estimate of the character and rise of those many influences prejudicial to the scientific study of history which cause such a wide gap between these two historians.  Foremost among these is the growing influence of rhetoric and the Isocratean school, which seems to have regarded history as an arena for the display either of pathos or paradoxes, not a scientific investigation into laws.  The new age is the age of style.  The same spirit of exclusive attention to form which made Euripides often, like Swinburne, prefer music to meaning and melody to morality, which gave to the later Greek statues that refined effeminacy, that overstrained gracefulness of attitude, was felt in the sphere of history.  The rules laid down for historical composition are those relating to the 'sthetic value of digressions, the legality of employing more than one metaphor in the same sentence, and the like; and historians are ranked not by their power of estimating evidence but by the goodness of the Greek they write.  I must note also the important influence on literature exercised by Alexander the Great; for while his travels encouraged the more accurate research of geography, the very splendour of his achievements seems to have brought history again into the sphere of romance.  The appearance of all great men in the world is followed invariably by the rise of that mythop?ic spirit and that tendency to look for the marvellous, which is so fatal to true historical criticism.  An Alexander, a Napoleon, a Francis of Assisi and a Mahomet are thought to be outside the limiting conditions of rational law, just as comets were supposed to be not very long ago.  While the founding of that city of Alexandria, in which Western and Eastern thought met with such strange result to both, diverted the critical tendencies of the Greek spirit into questions of grammar, philology and the like, the narrow, artificial atmosphere of that University town (as we may call it) was fatal to the development of that independent and speculative spirit of research which strikes out new methods of inquiry, of which historical criticism is one.  The Alexandrines combined a great love of learning with an ignorance of the true principles of research, an enthusiastic spirit for accumulating materials with a wonderful incapacity to use them.  Not among the hot sands of Egypt, or the Sophists of Athens, but from the very heart of Greece rises the man of genius on whose influence in the evolution of the philosophy of history I have a short time ago dwelt.  Born in the serene and pure air of the clear uplands of Arcadia, Polybius may be said to reproduce in his work the character of the place which gave him birth. For, of all the historians?I do not say of antiquity but of all time?none is more rationalistic than he, none more free from any belief in the ?visions and omens, the monstrous legends, the grovelling superstitions and unmanly craving for the supernatural? (_?????????????? ???????? ??? ????????? ???????????_ {68}) which he himself is compelled to notice as the characteristics of some of the historians who preceded him. Fortunate in the land which bore him, he was no less blessed in the wondrous time of his birth.  For, representing in himself the spiritual supremacy of the Greek intellect and allied in bonds of chivalrous friendship to the world-conqueror of his day, he seems led as it were by the hand of Fate ?to comprehend,? as has been said, ?more clearly than the Romans themselves the historical position of Rome,? and to discern with greater insight than all other men could those two great resultants of ancient civilisation, the material empire of the city of the seven hills, and the intellectual sovereignty of Hellas.  Before his own day, he says, {69a} the events of the world were unconnected and separate and the histories confined to particular countries.  Now, for the first time the universal empire of the Romans rendered a universal history possible. {69b}  This, then, is the august motive of his work: to trace the gradual rise of this Italian city from the day when the first legion crossed the narrow strait of Messina and landed on the fertile fields of Sicily to the time when Corinth in the East and Carthage in the West fell before the resistless wave of empire and the eagles of Rome passed on the wings of universal victory from Calpe and the Pillars of Hercules to Syria and the Nile.  At the same time he recognised that the scheme of Rome's empire was worked out under the ?gis of God's will. {69c}  For, as one of the Middle Age scribes most truly says, the _????_ of Polybius is that power which we Christians call God; the second aim, as one may call it, of his history is to point out the rational and human and natural causes which brought this result, distinguishing, as we should say, between God's mediate and immediate government of the world.  With any direct intervention of God in the normal development of Man, he will have nothing to do: still less with any idea of chance as a factor in the phenomena of life.  Chance and miracles, he says, are mere expressions for our ignorance of rational causes.  The spirit of rationalism which we recognised in Herodotus as a vague uncertain attitude and which appears in Thucydides as a consistent attitude of mind never argued about or even explained, is by Polybius analysed and formulated as the great instrument of historical research.  Herodotus, while believing on principle in the supernatural, yet was sceptical at times.  Thucydides simply ignored the supernatural.  He did not discuss it, but he annihilated it by explaining history without it. Polybius enters at length into the whole question and explains its origin and the method of treating it.  Herodotus would have believed in Scipio's dream.  Thucydides would have ignored it entirely.  Polybius explains it. He is the culmination of the rational progression of Dialectic. ?Nothing,? he says, 'shows a foolish mind more than the attempt to account for any phenomena on the principle of chance or supernatural intervention.  History is a search for rational causes, and there is nothing in the world?even those phenomena which seem to us the most remote from law and improbable?which is not the logical and inevitable result of certain rational antecedents.?  Some things, of course, are to be rejected _a priori_ without entering into the subject: ?As regards such miracles,? he says, {71} ?as that on a certain statue of Artemis rain or snow never falls though the statue stands in the open air, or that those who enter God's shrine in Arcadia lose their natural shadows, I cannot really be expected to argue upon the subject.  For these things are not only utterly improbable but absolutely impossible.?  ?For us to argue reasonably on an acknowledged absurdity is as vain a task as trying to catch water in a sieve; it is really to admit the possibility of the supernatural, which is the very point at issue.?  What Polybius felt was that to admit the possibility of a miracle is to annihilate the possibility of history: for just as scientific and chemical experiments would be either impossible or useless if exposed to the chance of continued interference on the part of some foreign body, so the laws and principles which govern history, the causes of phenomena, the evolution of progress, the whole science, in a word, of man's dealings with his own race and with nature, will remain a sealed book to him who admits the possibility of extra-natural interference.  The stories of miracles, then, are to be rejected on _a priori_ rational grounds, but in the case of events which we know to have happened the scientific historian will not rest till he has discovered their natural causes which, for instance, in the case of the wonderful rise of the Roman Empire?the most marvellous thing, Polybius says, which God ever brought about {72a}?are to be found in the excellence of their constitution (_?? ???????? ??? ?????????_), the wisdom of their advisers, their splendid military arrangements, and their superstition (_?? ?????????????_).  For while Polybius regarded the revealed religion as, of course, objective reality of truth, {72b} he laid great stress on its moral subjective influence, going, in one passage on the subject, even so far as almost to excuse the introduction of the supernatural in very small quantities into history on account of the extremely good effect it would have on pious people.  But perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and modern history which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of rationalism as one preserved to us in the Vatican'strange resting-place for it!?in which he treats of the terrible decay of population which had fallen on his native land in his own day, and which by the general orthodox public was regarded as a special judgment of God sending childlessness on women as a punishment for the sins of the people.  For it was a disaster quite without parallel in the history of the land, and entirely unforeseen by any of its political-economy writers who, on the contrary, were always anticipating that danger would arise from an excess of population overrunning its means of subsistence, and becoming unmanageable through its size.  Polybius, however, will have nothing to do with either priest or worker of miracles in this matter.  He will not even seek that 'sacred Heart of Greece,? Delphi, Apollo's shrine, whose inspiration even Thucydides admitted and before whose wisdom Socrates bowed.  How foolish, he says, were the man who on this matter would pray to God.  We must search for the rational causes, and the causes are seen to be clear, and the method of prevention also.  He then proceeds to notice how all this arose from the general reluctance to marriage and to bearing the expense of educating a large family which resulted from the carelessness and avarice of the men of his day, and he explains on entirely rational principles the whole of this apparently supernatural judgment.  Now, it is to be borne in mind that while his rejection of miracles as violation of inviolable laws is entirely _a priori_?for discussion of such a matter is, of course, impossible for a rational thinker?yet his rejection of supernatural intervention rests entirely on the scientific grounds of the necessity of looking for natural causes.  And he is quite logical in maintaining his position on these principles.  For, where it is either difficult or impossible to assign any rational cause for phenomena, or to discover their laws, he acquiesces reluctantly in the alternative of admitting some extra-natural interference which his essentially scientific method of treating the matter has logically forced on him, approving, for instance, of prayers for rain, on the express ground that the laws of meteorology had not yet been ascertained.  He would, of course, have been the first to welcome our modern discoveries in the matter.  The passage in question is in every way one of the most interesting in his whole work, not, of course, as signifying any inclination on his part to acquiesce in the supernatural, but because it shows how essentially logical and rational his method of argument was, and how candid and fair his mind.  Having now examined Polybius's attitude towards the supernatural and the general ideas which guided his research, I will proceed to examine the method he pursued in his scientific investigation of the complex phenomena of life.  For, as I have said before in the course of this essay, what is important in all great writers is not so much the results they arrive at as the methods they pursue.  The increased knowledge of facts may alter any conclusion in history as in physical science, and the canons of speculative historical credibility must be acknowledged to appeal rather to that subjective attitude of mind which we call the historic sense than to any formulated objective rules.  But a scientific method is a gain for all time, and the true if not the only progress of historical criticism consists in the improvement of the instruments of research.  Now first, as regards his conception of history, I have already pointed out that it was to him essentially a search for causes, a problem to be solved, not a picture to be painted, a scientific investigation into laws and t|2
42|endencies, not a mere romantic account of startling incident and wondrous adventure.  Thucydides, in the opening of his great work, had sounded the first note of the scientific conception of history.  ?The absence of romance in my pages,? he says, ?will, I fear, detract somewhat from its value, but I have written my work not to be the exploit of a passing hour but as the possession of all time.? {76}  Polybius follows with words almost entirely similar.  If, he says, we banish from history the consideration of causes, methods and motives (_?? ??? ??_, _??? ???_, _??? ????? ?????_), and refuse to consider how far the result of anything is its rational consequent, what is left is a mere _????????_, not a _??????_, an oratorical essay which may give pleasure for the moment, but which is entirely without any scientific value for the explanation of the future.  Elsewhere he says that ?history robbed of the exposition of its causes and laws is a profitless thing, though it may allure a fool.?  And all through his history the same point is put forward and exemplified in every fashion.  So far for the conception of history.  Now for the groundwork.  As regards the character of the phenomena to be selected by the scientific investigator, Aristotle had laid down the general formula that nature should be studied in her normal manifestations.  Polybius, true to his character of applying explicitly the principles implicit in the work of others, follows out the doctrine of Aristotle, and lays particular stress on the rational and undisturbed character of the development of the Roman constitution as affording special facilities for the discovery of the laws of its progress.  Political revolutions result from causes either external or internal.  The former are mere disturbing forces which lie outside the sphere of scientific calculation.  It is the latter which are important for the establishing of principles and the elucidation of the sequences of rational evolution.  He thus may be said to have anticipated one of the most important truths of the modern methods of investigation: I mean that principle which lays down that just as the study of physiology should precede the study of pathology, just as the laws of disease are best discovered by the phenomena presented in health, so the method of arriving at all great social and political truths is by the investigation of those cases where development has been normal, rational and undisturbed.  The critical canon that the more a people has been interfered with, the more difficult it becomes to generalise the laws of its progress and to analyse the separate forces of its civilisation, is one the validity of which is now generally recognised by those who pretend to a scientific treatment of all history: and while we have seen that Aristotle anticipated it in a general formula, to Polybius belongs the honour of being the first to apply it explicitly in the sphere of history.  I have shown how to this great scientific historian the motive of his work was essentially the search for causes; and true to his analytical spirit he is careful to examine what a cause really is and in what part of the antecedents of any consequent it is to be looked for.  To give an illustration: As regards the origin of the war with Perseus, some assigned as causes the expulsion of Abrupolis by Perseus, the expedition of the latter to Delphi, the plot against Eumenes and the seizure of the ambassadors in B?otia; of these incidents the two former, Polybius points out, were merely the pretexts, the two latter merely the occasions of the war.  The war was really a legacy left to Perseus by his father, who was determined to fight it out with Rome. {78}  Here as elsewhere he is not originating any new idea.  Thucydides had pointed out the difference between the real and the alleged cause, and the Aristotelian dictum about revolutions, _?? ???? ?????? ???? ?? ??????_, draws the distinction between cause and occasion with the brilliancy of an epigram.  But the explicit and rational investigation of the difference between _?????_, _????_, and _????????_ was reserved for Polybius.  No canon of historical criticism can be said to be of more real value than that involved in this distinction, and the overlooking of it has filled our histories with the contemptible accounts of the intrigues of courtiers and of kings and the petty plottings of backstairs influence?particulars interesting, no doubt, to those who would ascribe the Reformation to Anne Boleyn's pretty face, the Persian war to the influence of a doctor or a curtain-lecture from Atossa, or the French Revolution to Madame de Maintenon, but without any value for those who aim at any scientific treatment of history.  But the question of method, to which I am compelled always to return, is not yet exhausted.  There is another aspect in which it may be regarded, and I shall now proceed to treat of it.  One of the greatest difficulties with which the modern historian has to contend is the enormous complexity of the facts which come under his notice: D?Alembert's suggestion that at the end of every century a selection of facts should be made and the rest burned (if it was really intended seriously) could not, of course, be entertained for a moment.  A problem loses all its value when it becomes simplified, and the world would be all the poorer if the Sibyl of History burned her volumes. Besides, as Gibbon pointed out, ?a Montesquieu will detect in the most insignificant fact relations which the vulgar overlook.?  Nor can the scientific investigator of history isolate the particular elements, which he desires to examine, from disturbing and extraneous causes, as the experimental chemist can do (though sometimes, as in the case of lunatic asylums and prisons, he is enabled to observe phenomena in a certain degree of isolation).  So he is compelled either to use the deductive mode of arguing from general laws or to employ the method of abstraction, which gives a fictitious isolation to phenomena never so isolated in actual existence.  And this is exactly what Polybius has done as well as Thucydides.  For, as has been well remarked, there is in the works of these two writers a certain plastic unity of type and motive; whatever they write is penetrated through and through with a specific quality, a singleness and concentration of purpose, which we may contrast with the more comprehensive width as manifested not merely in the modern mind, but also in Herodotus.  Thucydides, regarding society as influenced entirely by political motives, took no account of forces of a different nature, and consequently his results, like those of most modern political economists, have to be modified largely {81} before they come to correspond with what we know was the actual state of fact.  Similarly, Polybius will deal only with those forces which tended to bring the civilised world under the dominion of Rome (ix. 1), and in the Thucydidean spirit points out the want of picturesqueness and romance in his pages which is the result of the abstract method (_?? ????????? ??? ?????????_) being careful also to tell us that his rejection of all other forces is essentially deliberate and the result of a preconceived theory and by no means due to carelessness of any kind.  Now, of the general value of the abstract method and the legality of its employment in the sphere of history, this is perhaps not the suitable occasion for any discussion.  It is, however, in all ways worthy of note that Polybius is not merely conscious of, but dwells with particular weight on, the fact which is usually urged as the strongest objection to the employment of the abstract method?I mean the conception of a society as a sort of human organism whose parts are indissolubly connected with one another and all affected when one member is in any way agitated. This conception of the organic nature of society appears first in Plato and Aristotle, who apply it to cities.  Polybius, as his wont is, expands it to be a general characteristic of all history.  It is an idea of the very highest importance, especially to a man like Polybius whose thoughts are continually turned towards the essential unity of history and the impossibility of isolation.  Farther, as regards the particular method of investigating that group of phenomena obtained for him by the abstract method, he will adopt, he tells us, neither the purely deductive nor the purely inductive mode but the union of both.  In other words, he formally adopts that method of analysis upon the importance of which I have dwelt before.  And lastly, while, without doubt, enormous simplicity in the elements under consideration is the result of the employment of the abstract method, even within the limit thus obtained a certain selection must be made, and a selection involves a theory.  For the facts of life cannot be tabulated with as great an ease as the colours of birds and insects can be tabulated.  Now, Polybius points out that those phenomena particularly are to be dwelt on which may serve as a _??????????_ or sample, and show the character of the tendencies of the age as clearly as ?a single drop from a full cask will be enough to disclose the nature of the whole contents.?  This recognition of the importance of single facts, not in themselves but because of the spirit they represent, is extremely scientific; for we know that from the single bone, or tooth even, the anatomist can recreate entirely the skeleton of the primeval horse, and the botanist tell the character of the flora and fauna of a district from a single specimen.  Regarding truth as ?the most divine thing in Nature,? the very ?eye and light of history without which it moves a blind thing,? Polybius spared no pains in the acquisition of historical materials or in the study of the sciences of politics and war, which he considered were so essential to the training of the scientific historian, and the labour he took is mirrored in the many ways in which he criticises other authorities.  There is something, as a rule, slightly contemptible about ancient criticism.  The modern idea of the critic as the interpreter, the expounder of the beauty and excellence of the work he selects, seems quite unknown.  Nothing can be more captious or unfair, for instance, than the method by which Aristotle criticised the ideal state of Plato in his ethical works, and the passages quoted by Polybius from Tim?us show that the latter historian fully deserved the punning name given to him. But in Polybius there is, I think, little of that bitterness and pettiness of spirit which characterises most other writers, and an incidental story he tells of his relations with one of the historians whom he criticised shows that he was a man of great courtesy and refinement of taste?as, indeed, befitted one who had lived always in the society of those who were of great and noble birth.  Now, as regards the character of the canons by which he criticises the works of other authors, in the majority of cases he employs simply his own geographical and military knowledge, showing, for instance, the impossibility in the accounts given of Nabis's march from Sparta simply by his acquaintance with the spots in question; or the inconsistency of those of the battle of Issus; or of the accounts given by Ephorus of the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea.  In the latter case he says, if any one will take the trouble to measure out the ground of the site of the battle and then test the man?uvres given, he will find how inaccurate the accounts are.  In other cases he appeals to public documents, the importance of which he was always foremost in recognising; showing, for instance, by a document in the public archives of Rhodes how inaccurate were the accounts given of the battle of Lade by Zeno and Antisthenes.  Or he appeals to psychological probability, rejecting, for instance, the scandalous stories told of Philip of Macedon, simply from the king's general greatness of character, and arguing that a boy so well educated and so respectably connected as Demochares (xii. 14) could never have been guilty of that of which evil rumour accused him.  But the chief object of his literary censure is Tim?us, who had been unsparing of his strictures on others.  The general point which he makes against him, impugning his accuracy as a historian, is that he derived his knowledge of history not from the dangerous perils of a life of action but in the secure indolence of a narrow scholastic life.  There is, indeed, no point on which he is so vehement as this.  ?A history,? he says, ?written in a library gives as lifeless and as inaccurate a picture of history as a painting which is copied not from a living animal but from a stuffed one.?  There is more difference, he says in another place, between the history of an eye-witness and that of one whose knowledge comes from books, than there is between the scenes of real life and the fictitious landscapes of theatrical scenery.  Besides this, he enters into somewhat elaborate detailed criticism of passages where he thought Tim?us was following a wrong method and perverting truth, passages which it will be worth while to examine in detail.  Tim?us, from the fact of there being a Roman custom to shoot a war-horse on a stated day, argued back to the Trojan origin of that people. Polybius, on the other hand, points out that the inference is quite unwarrantable, because horse-sacrifices are ordinary institutions common to all barbarous tribes.  Tim?us here, as was common with Greek writers, is arguing back from some custom of the present to an historical event in the past.  Polybius really is employing the comparative method, showing how the custom was an ordinary step in the civilisation of every early people.  In another place, {86} he shows how illogical is the scepticism of Tim?us as regards the existence of the Bull of Phalaris simply by appealing to the statue of the Bull, which was still to be seen in Carthage; pointing out how impossible it was, on any other theory except that it belonged to Phalaris, to account for the presence in Carthage of a bull of this peculiar character with a door between his shoulders.  But one of the great points which he uses against this Sicilian historian is in reference to the question of the origin of the Locrian colony.  In accordance with the received tradition on the subject, Aristotle had represented the Locrian colony as founded by some Parthenid? or slaves? children, as they were called, a statement which seems to have roused the indignation of Tim?us, who went to a good deal of trouble to confute this theory.  He does so on the following grounds:?  First of all, he points out that in the ancient days the Greeks had no slaves at all, so the mention of them in the matter is an anachronism; and next he declares that he was shown in the Greek city of Locris certain ancient inscriptions in which their relation to the Italian city was expressed in terms of the position between parent and child, which showed also that mutual rights of citizenship were accorded to each city. Besides this, he appeals to various questions of improbability as regards their international relationship, on which Polybius takes diametrically opposite grounds which hardly call for discussion.  And in favour of his own view he urges two points more: first, that the Laced?monians being allowed furlough for the purpose of seeing their wives at home, it was unlikely that the Locrians should not have had the same privilege; and next, that the Italian Locrians knew nothing of the Aristotelian version and had, on the contrary, very severe laws against adulterers, runaway slaves and the like.  Now, most of these questions rest on mere probability, which is always such a subjective canon that an appeal to it is rarely conclusive.  I would note, however, as regards the inscriptions which, if genuine, would of course have settled the matter, that Polybius looks on them as a mere invention on the part of Tim?us, who, he remarks, gives no details about them, though, as a rule, he is over-anxious to give chapter and verse for everything.  A somewhat more interesting point is that where he attacks Tim?us for the introduction of fictitious speeches into his narrative; for on this point Polybius seems to be far in advance of the opinions held by literary men on the subject not merely in his own day, but for centuries after.  Herodotus had introduced speeches avowedly dramatic and fictitious. Thucydides states clearly that, where he was unable to find out what people really said, he put down what they ought to have said.  Sallust alludes, it is true, to the fact of the speech he puts into the mouth of the tribune Memmius being essentially genuine, but the speeches given in the senate on the occasion of the Catilinarian conspiracy are very different from the same orations as they appear in Cicero.  Livy makes his ancient Romans wrangle and chop logic with all the subtlety of a Hortensius or a Sc?vola.  And even in later days, when shorthand reporters attended the debates of the senate and a _Daily News_ was published in Rome, we find that one of the most celebrated speeches in Tacitus (that in which the Emperor Claudius gives the Gauls their freedom) is shown, by an inscription discovered recently at Lugdunum, to be entirely fabulous.  Upon the other hand, it must be borne in mind that these speeches were not intended to deceive; they were regarded merely as a certain dramatic element which it was allowable to introduce into history for the purpose of giving more life and reality to the narration, and were to be criticised, not as we should, by arguing how in an age before shorthand was known such a report was possible or how, in the failure of written documents, tradition could bring down such an accurate verbal account, but by the higher test of their psychological probability as regards the persons in whose mouths they are placed.  An ancient historian in answer to modern criticism would say, probably, that these fictitious speeches were in reality more truthful than the actual ones, just as Aristotle claimed for poetry a higher degree of truth in comparison to history. The whole point is interesting as showing how far in advance of his age Polybius may be said to have been.  The last scientific historian, it is possible to gather from his writings what he considered were the characteristics of the ideal writer of history; and no small light will be thrown on the progress of historical criticism if we strive to collect and analyse what in Polybius are more or less scattered expressions.  The ideal historian must be contemporary with the events he describes, or removed from them by one generation only.  Where it is possible, he is to be an eye-witness of what he writes of; where that is out of his power he is to test all traditions and stories carefully and not to be ready to accept what is plausible in place of what is true.  He is to be no bookworm living aloof from the experiences of the world in the artificial isolation of a university town, but a politician, a soldier, and a traveller, a man not merely of thought but of action, one who can do great things as well as write of them, who in the sphere of history could be what Byron and 'schylus were in the sphere of poetry, at once _le chantre et le h?ros_.  He is to keep before his eyes the fact that chance is merely a synonym for our ignorance; that the reign of law pervades the domain of history as much as it does that of political science.  He is to accustom himself to look on all occasions for rational and natural causes.  And while he is to recognise the practical utility of the supernatural, in an educational point of view, he is not himself to indulge in such intellectual beating of the air as to admit the possibility of the violation of inviolable laws, or to argue in a sphere wherein argument is _a priori_ annihilated.  He is to be free from all bias towards friend and country; he is to be courteous and gentle in criticism; he is not to regard history as a mere opportunity for splendid and tragic writing; nor is he to falsify truth for the sake of a paradox or an epigram.  While acknowledging the importance of particular facts as samples of higher truths, he is to take a broad and general view of humanity.  He is to deal with the whole race and with the world, not with particular tribes or separate countries.  He is to bear in mind that the world is really an organism wherein no one part can be moved without the others being affected also.  He is to distinguish between cause and occasion, between the influence of general laws and particular fancies, and he is to remember that the greatest lessons of the world are contained in history and that it is the historian's duty to manifest them so as to save nations from following those unwise policies which always lead to dishonour and ruin, and to teach individuals to apprehend by the intellectual culture of history those truths which else they would have to learn in the bitter school of experience.  Now, as regards his theory of the necessity of the historian's being contemporary with the events he describes, so far as the historian is a mere narrator the remark is undoubtedly true.  But to appreciate the harmony and rational position of the facts of a great epoch, to discover its laws, the causes which produced it and the effects which it generates, the scene must be viewed from a certain height and distance to be completely apprehended.  A thoroughly contemporary historian such as Lord Clarendon or Thucydides is in reality part of the history he criticises; and, in the case of such contemporary historians as Fabius and Philistus, Polybius in compelled to acknowledge that they are misled by patriotic and other considerations.  Against Polybius himself no such accusation can be made.  He indeed of all men is able, as from some lofty tower, to discern the whole tendency of the ancient world, the triumph of Roman institutions and of Greek thought which is the last message of the old world and, in a more spiritual sense, has become the Gospel of the new.  One thing indeed he did not see, or if he saw it, he thought but little of it?how from the East there was spreading over the world, as a wave spreads, a spiritual inroad of new religions from the time when the Pessinuntine mother of the gods, a shapeless mass of stone, was brought to the eternal city by her holiest citizen, to the day when the ship _Castor and Pollux_ stood in at Puteoli, and St. Paul turned his face towards martyrdom and victory at Rome.  Polybius was able to predict, from his knowledge of the causes of revolutions and the tendencies of the various forms of governments, the uprising of that democratic tone of thought which, as soon as a seed is sown in the murder of the Gracchi and the exile of Marius, culminated as all democratic movements do culminate, in the supreme authority of one man, the lordship of the world under the world's rightful lord, Caius Julius C'sar.  This, indeed, he saw in no uncertain way.  But the turning of all men's hearts to the East, the first glimmering of that splendid dawn which broke over the hills of Galilee and flooded the earth like wine, was hidden from his eyes.  There are many points in the description of the ideal historian which one may compare to the picture which Plato has given us of the ideal philosopher.  They are both 'spectators of all time and all existence.? Nothing is contemptible in their eyes, for all things have a meaning, and they both walk in august reasonableness before all men, conscious of the workings of God yet free from all terror of mendicant priest or vagrant miracle-worker.  But the parallel ends here.  For the one stands aloof from the world-storm of sleet and hail, his eyes fixed on distant and sunlit heights, loving knowledge for the sake of knowledge and wisdom for the joy of wisdom, while the other is an eager actor in the world ever seeking to apply his knowledge to useful things.  Both equally desire truth, but the one because of its utility, the other for its beauty.  The historian regards it as the rational principle of all true history, and no more.  To the other it comes as an all-pervading and mystic enthusiasm, ?like the desire of strong wine, the craving of ambition, the passionate love of what is beautiful.?  Still, though we miss in the historian those higher and more spiritual qualities which the philosopher of the Academe alone of all men possessed, we must not blind ourselves to the merits of that great rationalist who seems to have anticipated the very latest words of modern science.  Nor yet is he to be regarded merely in the narrow light in which he is estimated by most modern critics, as the explicit champion of rationalism and nothing more.  For he is connected with another idea, the course of which is as the course of that great river of his native Arcadia which, springing from some arid and sun-bleached rock, gathers strength and beauty as it flows till it reaches the asphodel meadows of Olympia and the light and laughter of Ionian waters.  For in him we can discern the first notes of that great cult of the seven-hilled city which made Virgil write his epic and Livy his history, which found in Dante its highest exponent, which dreamed of an Empire where the Emperor would care for the bodies and the Pope for the souls of men, and so has passed into the conception of God's spiritual empire and the universal brotherhood of man and widened into the huge ocean of universal thought as the Peneus loses itself in the sea.  Polybius is the last scientific historian of Greece.  The writer who seems fittingly to complete the progress of thought is a writer of biographies only.  I will not here touch on Plutarch's employment of the inductive method as shown in his constant use of inscription and statue, of public document and building and the like, because it involves no new method.  It is his attitude towards miracles of which I desire to treat.  Plutarch is philosophic enough to see that in the sense of a violation of the laws of nature a miracle is impossible.  It is absurd, he says, to imagine that the statue of a saint can speak, and that an inanimate object not possessing the vocal organs should be able to utter an articulate sound.  Upon the other hand, he protests against science imagining that, by explaining the natural causes of things, it has explained away their transcendental meaning.  ?When the tears on the cheek of some holy statue have been analysed into the moisture which certain temperatures produce on wood and marble, it yet by no means follows that they were not a sign of grief and mourning set there by God Himself.?  When Lampon saw in the prodigy of the one-horned ram the omen of the supreme rule of Pericles, and when Anaxagoras showed that the abnormal development was the rational resultant of the peculiar formation of the skull, the dreamer and the man of science were both right; it was the business of the latter to consider how the prodigy came about, of the former to show why it was so formed and what it so portended.  The progression of thought is exemplified in all particulars.  Herodotus had a glimmering sense of the impossibility of a violation of nature. Thucydides ignored the supernatural.  Polybius rationalised it.  Plutarch raises it to its mystical heights again, though he bases it on law.  In a word, Plutarch felt that while science brings the supernatural down to the natural, yet ultimately all that is natural is really supernatural. To him, as to many of our own day, religion was that transcendental attitude of the mind which, contemplating a world resting on inviolable law, is yet comforted and seeks to worship God not in the violation but in the fulfilment of nature.  It may seem paradoxical to quote in connection with the priest of Ch?ronea such a pure rationalist as Mr. Herbert Spencer; yet when we read as the last message of modern science that ?when the equation of life has been reduced to its lowest terms the symbols are symbols still,? mere signs, that is, of that unknown reality which underlies all matter and all spirit, we may feel how over the wide strait of centuries thought calls to thought and how Plutarch has a higher position than is usually claimed for him in the progress of the Greek intellect.  And, indeed, it seems that not merely the importan|2
43|ce of Plutarch himself but also that of the land of his birth in the evolution of Greek civilisation has been passed over by modern critics.  To us, indeed, the bare rock to which the Parthenon serves as a crown, and which lies between Colonus and Attica's violet hills, will always be the holiest spot in the land of Greece: and Delphi will come next, and then the meadows of Eurotas where that noble people lived who represented in Hellenic thought the reaction of the law of duty against the law of beauty, the opposition of conduct to culture.  Yet, as one stands on the _?????? ????_ of Cith?ron and looks out on the great double plain of Boeotia, the enormous importance of the division of Hellas comes to one's mind with great force.  To the north are Orchomenus and the Minyan treasure-house, seat of those merchant princes of Phoenicia who brought to Greece the knowledge of letters and the art of working in gold. Thebes is at our feet with the gloom of the terrible legends of Greek tragedy still lingering about it, the birthplace of Pindar, the nurse of Epaminondas and the Sacred Band.  And from out of the plain where ?Mars loved to dance,? rises the Muses? haunt, Helicon, by whose silver streams Corinna and Hesiod sang; while far away under the white ?gis of those snow-capped mountains lies Ch?ronea and the Lion plain where with vain chivalry the Greeks strove to check Macedon first and afterwards Rome; Ch?ronea, where in the Martinmas summer of Greek civilisation Plutarch rose from the drear waste of a dying religion as the aftermath rises when the mowers think they have left the field bare.  Greek philosophy began and ended in scepticism: the first and the last word of Greek history was Faith.  Splendid thus in its death, like winter sunsets, the Greek religion passed away into the horror of night.  For the Cimmerian darkness was at hand, and when the schools of Athens were closed and the statue of Athena broken, the Greek spirit passed from the gods and the history of its own land to the subtleties of defining the doctrine of the Trinity and the mystical attempts to bring Plato into harmony with Christ and to reconcile Gethsemane and the Sermon on the Mount with the Athenian prison and the discussion in the woods of Colonus.  The Greek spirit slept for wellnigh a thousand years.  When it woke again, like Ant?us it had gathered strength from the earth where it lay; like Apollo it had lost none of its divinity through its long servitude.  In the history of Roman thought we nowhere find any of those characteristics of the Greek Illumination which I have pointed out are the necessary concomitants of the rise of historical criticism.  The conservative respect for tradition which made the Roman people delight in the ritual and formulas of law, and is as apparent in their politics as in their religion, was fatal to any rise of that spirit of revolt against authority the importance of which, as a factor in intellectual progress, we have already seen.  The whitened tables of the Pontifices preserved carefully the records of the eclipses and other atmospherical phenomena, and what we call the art of verifying dates was known to them at an early time; but there was no spontaneous rise of physical science to suggest by its analogies of law and order a new method of research, nor any natural springing up of the questioning spirit of philosophy with its unification of all phenomena and all knowledge.  At the very time when the whole tide of Eastern superstition was sweeping into the heart of the Capital the Senate banished the Greek philosophers from Rome.  And of the three systems which did at length take some root in the city, those of Zeno and Epicurus were used merely as the rule for the ordering of life, while the dogmatic scepticism of Carneades, by its very principles, annihilated the possibility of argument and encouraged a perfect indifference to research.  Nor were the Romans ever fortunate enough like the Greeks to have to face the incubus of any dogmatic system of legends and myths, the immoralities and absurdities of which might excite a revolutionary outbreak of sceptical criticism.  For the Roman religion became as it were crystallised and isolated from progress at an early period of its evolution.  Their gods remained mere abstractions of commonplace virtues or uninteresting personifications of the useful things of life.  The old primitive creed was indeed always upheld as a state institution on account of the enormous facilities it offered for cheating in politics, but as a spiritual system of belief it was unanimously rejected at a very early period both by the common people and the educated classes, for the sensible reason that it was so extremely dull.  The former took refuge in the mystic sensualities of the worship of Isis, the latter in the Stoical rules of life.  The Romans classified their gods carefully in their order of precedence, analysed their genealogies in the laborious spirit of modern heraldry, fenced them round with a ritual as intricate as their law, but never quite cared enough about them to believe in them.  So it was of no account with them when the philosophers announced that Minerva was merely memory.  She had never been much else.  Nor did they protest when Lucretius dared to say of Ceres and of Liber that they were only the corn of the field and the fruit of the vine.  For they had never mourned for the daughter of Demeter in the asphodel meadows of Sicily, nor traversed the glades of Cith?ron with fawn-skin and with spear.  This brief sketch of the condition of Roman thought will serve to prepare us for the almost total want of scientific historical criticism which we shall discern in their literature, and has, besides, afforded fresh corroboration of the conditions essential to the rise of this spirit, and of the modes of thought which it reflects and in which it is always to be found.  Roman historical composition had its origin in the pontifical college of ecclesiastical lawyers, and preserved to its close the uncritical spirit which characterised its fountain-head.  It possessed from the outset a most voluminous collection of the materials of history, which, however, produced merely antiquarians, not historians.  It is so hard to use facts, so easy to accumulate them.  Wearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals, which dwelt on little else but the rise and fall in provisions and the eclipses of the sun, Cato wrote out a history with his own hand for the instruction of his child, to which he gave the name of Origines, and before his time some aristocratic families had written histories in Greek much in the same spirit in which the Germans of the eighteenth century used French as the literary language.  But the first regular Roman historian is Sallust. Between the extravagant eulogies passed on this author by the French (such as De Closset), and Dr. Mommsen's view of him as merely a political pamphleteer, it is perhaps difficult to reach the _via media_ of unbiassed appreciation.  He has, at any rate, the credit of being a purely rationalistic historian, perhaps the only one in Roman literature. Cicero had a good many qualifications for a scientific historian, and (as he usually did) thought very highly of his own powers.  On passages of ancient legend, however, he is rather unsatisfactory, for while he is too sensible to believe them he is too patriotic to reject them.  And this is really the attitude of Livy, who claims for early Roman legend a certain uncritical homage from the rest of the subject world.  His view in his history is that it is not worth while to examine the truth of these stories.  In his hands the history of Rome unrolls before our eyes like some gorgeous tapestry, where victory succeeds victory, where triumph treads on the heels of triumph, and the line of heroes seems never to end.  It is not till we pass behind the canvas and see the slight means by which the effect is produced that we apprehend the fact that like most picturesque writers Livy is an indifferent critic.  As regards his attitude towards the credibility of early Roman history he is quite as conscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature.  He will not, for instance, decide whether the Horatii were Albans or Romans; who was the first dictator; how many tribunes there were, and the like.  His method, as a rule, is merely to mention all the accounts and sometimes to decide in favour of the most probable, but usually not to decide at all.  No canons of historical criticism will ever discover whether the Roman women interviewed the mother of Coriolanus of their own accord or at the suggestion of the senate; whether Remus was killed for jumping over his brother's wall or because they quarrelled about birds; whether the ambassadors found Cincinnatus ploughing or only mending a hedge.  Livy suspends his judgment over these important facts and history when questioned on their truth is dumb.  If he does select between two historians he chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes. But he is no critic, only a conscientious writer.  It is mere vain waste to dwell on his critical powers, for they do not exist.                                  * * * * *  In the case of Tacitus imagination has taken the place of history.  The past lives again in his pages, but through no laborious criticism; rather through a dramatic and psychological faculty which he specially possessed.  In the philosophy of history he has no belief.  He can never make up his mind what to believe as regards God's government of the world.  There is no method in him and none elsewhere in Roman literature.  Nations may not have missions but they certainly have functions.  And the function of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in our institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental creed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite.  Italy was not a pioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of thought.  The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land and found nowhere a resting-place.  The dove, which is the bird of Christ, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began.  It was the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in medi?val costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which was the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us as an allegory.  For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard the buried spirit of progress.  When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose, the sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside.  Humanity had risen from the dead.  The study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of criticism, comparison and research.  At the opening of that education of modern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words of Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a fragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train of reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in the universe.  Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a return to Greek modes of thought.  The monkish hymns which obscured the pages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new method were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of medi?valism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad adolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality, when the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what was beforetime hidden from it.  To herald the opening of the sixteenth century, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great authors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words _????? ? ????????? ??????? ??? ????????_; words which may serve to remind us with what wondrous prescience Polybius saw the world's fate when he foretold the material sovereignty of Roman institutions and exemplified in himself the intellectual empire of Greece.  The course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not been a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now antiquated and of no account.  The only spirit which is entirely removed from us is the medi?val; the Greek spirit is essentially modern.  The introduction of the comparative method of research which has forced history to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us.  Ours, too, is a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival. Nor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of crucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance in modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the statical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all physical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single instance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new science of prehistoric arch?ology and to bring us back to a time when man was coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros. But, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of historical criticism.  Across the drear waste of a thousand years the Greek and the modern spirit join hands.  In the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of death to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first reached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame received a prize.  In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought let us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit that sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps to the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth.     THE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE OF ART   ?The English Renaissance of Art? was delivered as a lecture for the first time in the Chickering Hall, New York, on January 9, 1882.  A portion of it was reported in the _New York Tribune_ on the following day and in other American papers subsequently.  Since then this portion has been reprinted, more or less accurately, from time to time, in unauthorised editions.  There are in existence no less than four copies of the lecture, the earliest of which is entirely in the author's handwriting.  The others are type-written and contain many corrections and additions made by the author in manuscript.  These have all been collated and the text here given contains, as nearly as possible, the lecture in the original form as delivered by the author during his tour in the United States.  AMONG the many debts which we owe to the supreme 'sthetic faculty of Goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the most concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special manifestations.  So, in the lecture which I have the honour to deliver before you, I will not try to give you any abstract definition of beauty?any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth century'still less to communicate to you that which in its essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a particular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but rather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great English Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, as far as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is possible.  I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention to form, its seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art, new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our romantic movement because it is our most recent expression of beauty.  It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought, and again as a mere revival of medi?val feeling.  Rather I would say that to these forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value the intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give: taking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm, from the other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision.  For what, as Goethe said, is the study of the ancients but a return to the real world (for that is what they did); and what, said Mazzini, is medi?valism but individuality?  It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its sanity of purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive, the intensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic spirit, that springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as from the marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion.  Such expressions as ?classical? and ?romantic? are, it is true, often apt to become the mere catchwords of schools.  We must always remember that art has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one high law, the law of form or harmony?yet between the classical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies this difference at least, that the one deals with the type and the other with the exception.  In the work produced under the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the essential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary situation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to render.  In sculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subject predominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type of the other, the situation predominates over the subject.  There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of romance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste.  As regards their origin, in art as in politics there is but one origin for all revolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a freer method and opportunity of expression.  Yet, I think that in estimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our English Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the progress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it would be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its true meaning.  And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this crowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with art and the love of art, we must take into account many great events of history which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling.  Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh voice of a rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must seem, in its passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to form, its exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French Revolution that we must look for the most primary factor of its production, the first condition of its birth: that great Revolution of which we are all the children though the voices of some of us be often loud against it; that Revolution to which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and Wordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown across seas came from your young Republic.  It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown us that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but evolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over France in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble for his throne, was first sounded in literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace was taken.  The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by that critical spirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring all things to the test of reason or utility or both, while the discontent of the people in the streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life of Emile and of Werther.  For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had called humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and preached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music still lingers about our keen northern air.  And Goethe and Scott had brought romance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many centuries?and what is romance but humanity?  Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and terror of that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the artistic Renaissance bent to her own service when the time came?a scientific tendency first, which has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in the sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good.  I do not mean merely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its strength, or that more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was thinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned expression in the face of science, and that when science would put on a form of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration.  Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence on the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the characteristics of the real artist.  The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William Blake, is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary line, the more perfect is the work of art; and the less keen and sharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and bungling.  ?Great inventors in all ages knew this?Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known by this and by this alone?; and another time he wrote, with all the simple directness of nineteenth-century prose, ?to generalise is to be an idiot.?  And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision, this artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work and poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus.  It lies at the base of all noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty abstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical dramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German sentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism which also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying the impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy, though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day, bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford, the school of Emerson to America.  Yet is this spirit of transcendentalism alien to the spirit of art.  For the artist can accept no sphere of life in exchange for life itself.  For him there is no escape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of escape.  He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him.  The metaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life.  ?The storm of revolution,? as Andre Chenier said, ?blows out the torch of poetry.?  It is not for some little time that the real influence of such a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the desire for equality seems to have produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than the world had ever known before.  Men heard the lyre of Byron and the legions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless passions and of measureless despair; ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and art; the age was an age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit must pass, but one in which it cannot rest.  For the aim of culture is not rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash by night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air.  And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of the Revolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and flawless realisation.  Phidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed in Homer: Dante prefigures for us the passion and colour and intensity of Italian painting: the modern love of landscape dates from Rousseau, and it is in Keats that one discerns the beginning of the artistic renaissance of England.  Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness and clearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerring sense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the imagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist, the forerunner of the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great romantic movement of which I am to speak.  Blake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty, spiritual mission, and had striven to raise design to the ideal level of poetry and music, but the remoteness of his vision both in painting and poetry and the incompleteness of his technical powers had been adverse to any real influence.  It is in Keats that the artistic spirit of this century first found its absolute incarnation.  And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they?  If you ask nine-tenths of the British public what is the meaning of the word 'sthetics, they will tell you it is the French for affectation or the German for a dado; and if you inquire about the pre-Raphaelites you will hear something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art.  To know nothing about their great men is one of the necessary elements of English education.  As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough.  In the year 1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters, passionate admirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit of meeting together for discussions on art, the result of such discussions being that the English Philistine public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in its midst a body of young men who had determined to revolutionise English painting and poetry.  They called themselves the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and produce any serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen; and besides this, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood?among whom the names of Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you?had on their side three things that the English public never forgives: youth, power and enthusiasm.  Satire, always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as it is insolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays to genius?doing, here as always, infinite harm to the public, blinding them to what is beautiful, teaching them that irreverence which is the source of all vileness and narrowness of life, but harming the artist not at all, rather confirming him in the perfect rightness of his work and ambition.  For to disagree with three-fourths of the British public on all points is one of the first elements of sanity, one of the deepest consolations in all moments of spiritual doubt.  As regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration of English art, we may see at the base of their artistic creations a desire for a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as a more decorative value.  Pre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated the early Italian masters at all, but that in their work, as opposed to the facile abstractions of Raphael, they found a stronger realism of imagination, a more careful realism of technique, a vision at once more fervent and more vivid, an individuality more intimate and more intense.  For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the 'sthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it, if it is to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality, an individuality remote from that of ordinary men, and coming near to |2
44|us only by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in the work, and through channels whose very strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.  _La personnalit?_, said one of the greatest of modern French critics, _voil? ce qui nous sauvera_.  But above all things was it a return to Nature?that formula which seems to suit so many and such diverse movements: they would draw and paint nothing but what they saw, they would try and imagine things as they really happened.  Later there came to the old house by Blackfriars Bridge, where this young brotherhood used to meet and work, two young men from Oxford, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris?the latter substituting for the simpler realism of the early days a more exquisite spirit of choice, a more faultless devotion to beauty, a more intense seeking for perfection: a master of all exquisite design and of all spiritual vision.  It is of the school of Florence rather than of that of Venice that he is kinsman, feeling that the close imitation of Nature is a disturbing element in imaginative art.  The visible aspect of modern life disturbs him not; rather is it for him to render eternal all that is beautiful in Greek, Italian, and Celtic legend.  To Morris we owe poetry whose perfect precision and clearness of word and vision has not been excelled in the literature of our country, and by the revival of the decorative arts he has given to our individualised romantic movement the social idea and the social factor also.  But the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men, with Ruskin's faultless and fervent eloquence to help them, was not one of ideas merely but of execution, not one of conceptions but of creations.  For the great eras in the history of the development of all the arts have been eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm in feeling for art, but of new technical improvements primarily and specially.  The discovery of marble quarries in the purple ravines of Pentelicus and on the little low-lying hills of the island of Paros gave to the Greeks the opportunity for that intensified vitality of action, that more sensuous and simple humanism, to which the Egyptian sculptor working laboriously in the hard porphyry and rose-coloured granite of the desert could not attain.  The splendour of the Venetian school began with the introduction of the new oil medium for painting.  The progress in modern music has been due to the invention of new instruments entirely, and in no way to an increased consciousness on the part of the musician of any wider social aim.  The critic may try and trace the deferred resolutions of Beethoven {124} to some sense of the incompleteness of the modern intellectual spirit, but the artist would have answered, as one of them did afterwards, ?Let them pick out the fifths and leave us at peace.?  And so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious French metres like the Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all this increased value laid on elaborate alliterations, and on curious words and refrains, such as you will find in Dante Rossetti and Swinburne, is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol and trumpet through which the spirit of the age and the lips of the poet may blow the music of their many messages.  And so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is a reaction against the empty conventional workmanship, the lax execution of previous poetry and painting, showing itself in the work of such men as Rossetti and Burne-Jones by a far greater splendour of colour, a far more intricate wonder of design than English imaginative art has shown before. In Rossetti's poetry and the poetry of Morris, Swinburne and Tennyson a perfect precision and choice of language, a style flawless and fearless, a seeking for all sweet and precious melodies and a sustaining consciousness of the musical value of each word are opposed to that value which is merely intellectual.  In this respect they are one with the romantic movement of France of which not the least characteristic note was struck by Th?ophile Gautier's advice to the young poet to read his dictionary every day, as being the only book worth a poet's reading.  While, then, the material of workmanship is being thus elaborated and discovered to have in itself incommunicable and eternal qualities of its own, qualities entirely satisfying to the poetic sense and not needing for their 'sthetic effect any lofty intellectual vision, any deep criticism of life or even any passionate human emotion at all, the spirit and the method of the poet's working?what people call his inspiration?have not escaped the controlling influence of the artistic spirit.  Not that the imagination has lost its wings, but we have accustomed ourselves to count their innumerable pulsations, to estimate their limitless strength, to govern their ungovernable freedom.  To the Greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic production, and the places occupied by either spontaneity or self-consciousness in any artistic work, had a peculiar fascination.  We find it in the mysticism of Plato and in the rationalism of Aristotle.  We find it later in the Italian Renaissance agitating the minds of such men as Leonardo da Vinci. Schiller tried to adjust the balance between form and feeling, and Goethe to estimate the position of self-consciousness in art.  Wordsworth's definition of poetry as ?emotion remembered in tranquillity? may be taken as an analysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative work has to pass; and in Keats's longing to be ?able to compose without this fever? (I quote from one of his letters), his desire to substitute for poetic ardour ?a more thoughtful and quiet power,? we may discern the most important moment in the evolution of that artistic life.  The question made an early and strange appearance in your literature too; and I need not remind you how deeply the young poets of the French romantic movement were excited and stirred by Edgar Allan Poe's analysis of the workings of his own imagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work which we know by the name of _The Raven_.  In the last century, when the intellectual and didactic element had intruded to such an extent into the kingdom which belongs to poetry, it was against the claims of the understanding that an artist like Goethe had to protest.  ?The more incomprehensible to the understanding a poem is the better for it,? he said once, asserting the complete supremacy of the imagination in poetry as of reason in prose.  But in this century it is rather against the claims of the emotional faculties, the claims of mere sentiment and feeling, that the artist must react.  The simple utterance of joy is not poetry any more than a mere personal cry of pain, and the real experiences of the artist are always those which do not find their direct expression but are gathered up and absorbed into some artistic form which seems, from such real experiences, to be the farthest removed and the most alien.  ?The heart contains passion but the imagination alone contains poetry,? says Charles Baudelaire.  This too was the lesson that Th?ophile Gautier, most subtle of all modern critics, most fascinating of all modern poets, was never tired of teaching??Everybody is affected by a sunrise or a sunset.?  The absolute distinction of the artist is not his capacity to feel nature so much as his power of rendering it.  The entire subordination of all intellectual and emotional faculties to the vital and informing poetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of our Renaissance.  We have seen the artistic spirit working, first in the delightful and technical sphere of language, the sphere of expression as opposed to subject, then controlling the imagination of the poet in dealing with his subject.  And now I would point out to you its operation in the choice of subject.  The recognition of a separate realm for the artist, a consciousness of the absolute difference between the world of art and the world of real fact, between classic grace and absolute reality, forms not merely the essential element of any 'sthetic charm but is the characteristic of all great imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic creation?of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael Angelo, of the age of Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.  Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of the day: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for us that which we desire.  For to most of us the real life is the life we do not lead, and thus, remaining more true to the essence of its own perfection, more jealous of its own unattainable beauty, is less likely to forget form in feeling or to accept the passion of creation as any substitute for the beauty of the created thing.  The artist is indeed the child of his own age, but the present will not be to him a whit more real than the past; for, like the philosopher of the Platonic vision, the poet is the spectator of all time and of all existence.  For him no form is obsolete, no subject out of date; rather, whatever of life and passion the world has known, in desert of Jud?a or in Arcadian valley, by the rivers of Troy or the rivers of Damascus, in the crowded and hideous streets of a modern city or by the pleasant ways of Camelot?all lies before him like an open scroll, all is still instinct with beautiful life.  He will take of it what is salutary for his own spirit, no more; choosing some facts and rejecting others with the calm artistic control of one who is in possession of the secret of beauty.  There is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all things, but all things are not fit subjects for poetry.  Into the secure and sacred house of Beauty the true artist will admit nothing that is harsh or disturbing, nothing that gives pain, nothing that is debatable, nothing about which men argue.  He can steep himself, if he wishes, in the discussion of all the social problems of his day, poor-laws and local taxation, free trade and bimetallic currency, and the like; but when he writes on these subjects it will be, as Milton nobly expressed it, with his left hand, in prose and not in verse, in a pamphlet and not in a lyric.  This exquisite spirit of artistic choice was not in Byron: Wordsworth had it not.  In the work of both these men there is much that we have to reject, much that does not give us that sense of calm and perfect repose which should be the effect of all fine, imaginative work. But in Keats it seemed to have been incarnate, and in his lovely _Ode on a Grecian Urn_ it found its most secure and faultless expression; in the pageant of the _Earthly Paradise_ and the knights and ladies of Burne-Jones it is the one dominant note.  It is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by such a clarion note as Whitman's, to migrate from Greece and Ionia and to placard REMOVED and TO LET on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus. Calliope's call is not yet closed, nor are the epics of Asia ended; the Sphinx is not yet silent, nor the fountain of Castaly dry.  For art is very life itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolute truth and takes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr. Swinburne insisting on at dinner) that Achilles is even now more actual and real than Wellington, not merely more noble and interesting as a type and figure but more positive and real.  Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporal considerations are no principle at all.  For to the poet all times and places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal and eternally the same: no theme is inept, no past or present preferable.  The steam whistle will not affright him nor the flutes of Arcadia weary him: for him there is but one time, the artistic moment; but one law, the law of form; but one land, the land of Beauty?a land removed indeed from the real world and yet more sensuous because more enduring; calm, yet with that calm which dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, the calm which comes not from the rejection but from the absorption of passion, the calm which despair and sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only.  And so it comes that he who seems to stand most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best, because he has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory, stripped it of that ?mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us.?  Those strange, wild-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirlwind of ecstasy, those mighty-limbed and Titan prophets, labouring with the secret of the earth and the burden of mystery, that guard and glorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome?do they not tell us more of the real spirit of the Italian Renaissance, of the dream of Savonarola and of the sin of Borgia, than all the brawling boors and cooking women of Dutch art can teach us of the real spirit of the history of Holland?  And so in our own day, also, the two most vital tendencies of the nineteenth century?the democratic and pantheistic tendency and the tendency to value life for the sake of art?found their most complete and perfect utterance in the poetry of Shelley and Keats who, to the blind eyes of their own time, seemed to be as wanderers in the wilderness, preachers of vague or unreal things.  And I remember once, in talking to Mr. Burne-Jones about modern science, his saying to me, ?the more materialistic science becomes, the more angels shall I paint: their wings are my protest in favour of the immortality of the soul.?  But these are the intellectual speculations that underlie art.  Where in the arts themselves are we to find that breadth of human sympathy which is the condition of all noble work; where in the arts are we to look for what Mazzini would call the social ideas as opposed to the merely personal ideas?  By virtue of what claim do I demand for the artist the love and loyalty of the men and women of the world?  I think I can answer that.  Whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matter for his own soul.  He may bring judgment like Michael Angelo or peace like Angelico; he may come with mourning like the great Athenian or with mirth like the singer of Sicily; nor is it for us to do aught but accept his teaching, knowing that we cannot smite the bitter lips of Leopardi into laughter or burden with our discontent Goethe's serene calm.  But for warrant of its truth such message must have the flame of eloquence in the lips that speak it, splendour and glory in the vision that is its witness, being justified by one thing only?the flawless beauty and perfect form of its expression: this indeed being the social idea, being the meaning of joy in art.  Not laughter where none should laugh, nor the calling of peace where there is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but the pictorial charm only, the wonder of its colour, the satisfying beauty of its design.  You have most of you seen, probably, that great masterpiece of Rubens which hangs in the gallery of Brussels, that swift and wonderful pageant of horse and rider arrested in its most exquisite and fiery moment when the winds are caught in crimson banner and the air lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of plume.  Well, that is joy in art, though that golden hillside be trodden by the wounded feet of Christ and it is for the death of the Son of Man that that gorgeous cavalcade is passing.  But this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is not receptive enough of the sensuous element of art; and so the real influence of the arts is hidden from many of us: only a few, escaping from the tyranny of the soul, have learned the secret of those high hours when thought is not.  And this indeed is the reason of the influence which Eastern art is having on us in Europe, and of the fascination of all Japanese work. While the Western world has been laying on art the intolerable burden of its own intellectual doubts and the spiritual tragedy of its own sorrows, the East has always kept true to art's primary and pictorial conditions.  In judging of a beautiful statue the 'sthetic faculty is absolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of those marble lips that are dumb to our complaint, the noble modelling of those limbs that are powerless to help us.  In its primary aspect a painting has no more spiritual message or meaning than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of Damascus: it is a beautifully coloured surface, nothing more.  The channels by which all noble imaginative work in painting should touch, and do touch the soul, are not those of the truths of life, nor metaphysical truths.  But that pictorial charm which does not depend on any literary reminiscence for its effect on the one hand, nor is yet a mere result of communicable technical skill on the other, comes of a certain inventive and creative handling of colour. Nearly always in Dutch painting and often in the works of Giorgione or Titian, it is entirely independent of anything definitely poetical in the subject, a kind of form and choice in workmanship which is itself entirely satisfying, and is (as the Greeks would say) an end in itself.  And so in poetry too, the real poetical quality, the joy of poetry, comes never from the subject but from an inventive handling of rhythmical language, from what Keats called the 'sensuous life of verse.?  The element of song in the singing accompanied by the profound joy of motion, is so sweet that, while the incomplete lives of ordinary men bring no healing power with them, the thorn-crown of the poet will blossom into roses for our pleasure; for our delight his despair will gild its own thorns, and his pain, like Adonis, be beautiful in its agony; and when the poet's heart breaks it will break in music.  And health in art?what is that?  It has nothing to do with a sane criticism of life.  There is more health in Baudelaire than there is in [Kingsley].  Health is the artist's recognition of the limitations of the form in which he works.  It is the honour and the homage which he gives to the material he uses?whether it be language with its glories, or marble or pigment with their glories?knowing that the true brotherhood of the arts consists not in their borrowing one another's method, but in their producing, each of them by its own individual means, each of them by keeping its objective limits, the same unique artistic delight.  The delight is like that given to us by music?for music is the art in which form and matter are always one, the art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its expression, the art which most completely realises the artistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring.  And criticism?what place is that to have in our culture?  Well, I think that the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times, and upon all subjects: _C?est un grand avantage de n?avoir rien fait_, _mais il ne faut pas en abuser_.  It is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain any knowledge of the quality of created things.  You have listened to _Patience_ for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one only.  It will make, no doubt, that satire more piquant by knowing something about the subject of it, but you must not judge of 'stheticism by the satire of Mr. Gilbert.  As little should you judge of the strength and splendour of sun or sea by the dust that dances in the beam, or the bubble that breaks on the wave, as take your critic for any sane test of art.  For the artists, like the Greek gods, are revealed only to one another, as Emerson says somewhere; their real value and place time only can show. In this respect also omnipotence is with the ages.  The true critic addresses not the artist ever but the public only.  His work lies with them.  Art can never have any other claim but her own perfection: it is for the critic to create for art the social aim, too, by teaching the people the spirit in which they are to approach all artistic work, the love they are to give it, the lesson they are to draw from it.  All these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with modern progress and civilisation, and to make herself the mouthpiece for the voice of humanity, these appeals to art ?to have a mission,? are appeals which should be made to the public.  The art which has fulfilled the conditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions: it is for the critic to teach the people how to find in the calm of such art the highest expression of their own most stormy passions.  ?I have no reverence,? said Keats, ?for the public, nor for anything in existence but the Eternal Being, the memory of great men and the principle of Beauty.?  Such then is the principle which I believe to be guiding and underlying our English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided and wonderful, productive of strong ambitions and lofty personalities, yet for all its splendid achievements in poetry and in the decorative arts and in painting, for all the increased comeliness and grace of dress, and the furniture of houses and the like, not complete.  For there can be no great sculpture without a beautiful national life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that; no great drama without a noble national life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that too.  It is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the burden of the modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct with the fire of romantic passion?the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and the chapel of the Medici show us that?but it is that, as Th?ophile Gautier used to say, the visible world is dead, _le monde visible a disparu_.  Nor is it again that the novel has killed the play, as some critics would persuade us?the romantic movement of France shows us that.  The work of Balzac and of Hugo grew up side by side together; nay, more, were complementary to each other, though neither of them saw it.  While all other forms of poetry may flourish in an ignoble age, the splendid individualism of the lyrist, fed by its own passion, and lit by its own power, may pass as a pillar of fire as well across the desert as across places that are pleasant.  It is none the less glorious though no man follow it?nay, by the greater sublimity of its loneliness it may be quickened into loftier utterance and intensified into clearer song.  From the mean squalor of the sordid life that limits him, the dreamer or the idyllist may soar on poesy's viewless wings, may traverse with fawn-skin and spear the moonlit heights of Cith?ron though Faun and Bassarid dance there no more.  Like Keats he may wander through the old-world forests of Latmos, or stand like Morris on the galley's deck with the Viking when king and galley have long since passed away.  But the drama is the meeting-place of art and life; it deals, as Mazzini said, not merely with man, but with social man, with man in his relation to God and to Humanity.  It is the product of a period of great national united energy; it is impossible without a noble public, and belongs to such ages as the age of Elizabeth in London and of Pericles at Athens; it is part of such lofty moral and spiritual ardour as came to Greek after the defeat of the Persian fleet, and to Englishman after the wreck of the Armada of Spain.  Shelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect, and has shown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he would have purified our age; but in spite of _The Cenci_ the drama is one of the artistic forms through which the genius of the England of this century seeks in vain to find outlet and expression.  He has had no worthy imitators.  It is rather, perhaps, to you that we should turn to complete and perfect this great movement of ours, for there is something Hellenic in your air and world, something that has a quicker breath of the joy and power of Elizabeth's England about it than our ancient civilisation can give us. For you, at least, are young; ?no hungry generations tread you down,? and the past does not weary you with the intolerable burden of its memories nor mock you with the ruins of a beauty, the secret of whose creation you have lost.  That very absence of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought would rob your rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light, may be rather the source of your freedom and your strength.  To speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside, has been defined by one of your poets as a flawless triumph of art.  It is a triumph which you above all nations may be destined to achieve.  For the voices that have their dwelling in sea and mountain are not the chosen music of Liberty only; other messages are there in the wonder of wind-swept height and the majesty of silent deep?messages that, if you will but listen to them, may yield you the splendour of some new imagination, the marvel of some new beauty.  ?I foresee,? said Goethe, ?the dawn of a new literature which all people may claim as their own, for all have contributed to its foundation.?  If, then, this is so, and if the materials for a civilisation as great as that of Europe lie all around you, what profit, you will ask me, will all this study of our poets and painters be to you?  I might answer that the intellect can be engaged without direct didactic object on an artistic and historical problem; that the demand of the intellect is merely to feel itself alive; that nothing which has ever interested men or women can cease to be a fit subject for culture.  I might remind you of what all Europe owes to the sorrow of a single Florentine in exile at Verona, or to the love of Petrarch by that little well in Southern France; nay, more, how even in this dull, materialistic age the simple expression of an old man's simple life, passed away from the clamour of great cities amid the lakes and misty hills of Cumberland, has opened out for England treasures of new joy compared with which the treasures of her luxury are as barren as the sea which she has made her highway, and as bitter as the fire which she would make her slave.  But I think it will bring you something besides this, something that is the knowledge of real strength in art: not that you should imitate the works of these men; but their artistic spirit, their artistic attitude, I think you should absorb that.  For in nations, as in individuals, if the passion for creation be not accompanied by the critical, the 'sthetic faculty also, it will be sure to waste its strength aimlessly, failing perhaps in the artistic spirit of choice, or in the mistaking of feeling for form, or in the following of false ideals.  For the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a natural affinity with certain sensuous forms of art?and to discern the qualities of each art, to intensify as well its limitations as its powers of expression, is one of the aims that culture sets before us.  It is not an increased moral sense, an increased moral supervision that your literature needs.  Indeed, one should never talk of a moral or an immoral poem?poems are either well written or badly written, that is all.  And, indeed, any element of morals or implied reference to a standard of good or evil in art is often a sign of a certain incompleteness of vision, often a note of discord in the harmony of an imaginative creation; for all good work aims at a purely artistic effect.  ?We must be careful,? said Goethe, ?not to be always looking for culture merely in what is obviously moral.  Everything that is great promotes civilisation as soon as we are aware of it.?  But, as in your cities so in your literature, it is a permanent canon and standard of taste, an increased sensibility to beauty (if I may say so) that is lacking.  All noble work is not national merely, but universal. The political independence of a nation must not be confused with any intellectual isolation.  The spiritual freedom, indeed, your own generous lives and liberal air will give you.  From us you will learn the classical restraint of form.  For all great art is delicate art, roughness having very little to do with strength, and harshness very little to do with power.  ?The artist,? as Mr. Swinburne says, ?must be perfectly articulate.?  This limitation is for the artist perfect freedom: it is at once the origin and the sign of his strength.  So that all the supreme maste|2
45|rs of style?Dante, Sophocles, Shakespeare?are the supreme masters of spiritual and intellectual vision also.  Love art for its own sake, and then all things that you need will be added to you.  This devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is the test of all great civilised nations.  Philosophy may teach us to bear with equanimity the misfortunes of our neighbours, and science resolve the moral sense into a secretion of sugar, but art is what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation, art is what makes the life of the whole race immortal.  For beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm.  Philosophies fall away like sand, and creeds follow one another like the withered leaves of autumn; but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons and a possession for all eternity.  Wars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle by trampled field or leaguered city, and the rising of nations there must always be. But I think that art, by creating a common intellectual atmosphere between all countries, might?if it could not overshadow the world with the silver wings of peace?at least make men such brothers that they would not go out to slay one another for the whim or folly of some king or minister, as they do in Europe.  Fraternity would come no more with the hands of Cain, nor Liberty betray freedom with the kiss of Anarchy; for national hatreds are always strongest where culture is lowest.  ?How could I?? said Goethe, when reproached for not writing like Korner against the French.  ?How could I, to whom barbarism and culture alone are of importance, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth, a nation to which I owe a great part of my own cultivation??  Mighty empires, too, there must always be as long as personal ambition and the spirit of the age are one, but art at least is the only empire which a nation's enemies cannot take from her by conquest, but which is taken by submission only.  The sovereignty of Greece and Rome is not yet passed away, though the gods of the one be dead and the eagles of the other tired.  And we in our Renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty that will still be England's when her yellow leopards have grown weary of wars and the rose of her shield is crimsoned no more with the blood of battle; and you, too, absorbing into the generous heart of a great people this pervading artistic spirit, will create for yourselves such riches as you have never yet created, though your land be a network of railways and your cities the harbours for the galleys of the world.  I know, indeed, that the divine natural prescience of beauty which is the inalienable inheritance of Greek and Italian is not our inheritance.  For such an informing and presiding spirit of art to shield us from all harsh and alien influences, we of the Northern races must turn rather to that strained self-consciousness of our age which, as it is the key-note of all our romantic art, must be the source of all or nearly all our culture.  I mean that intellectual curiosity of the nineteenth century which is always looking for the secret of the life that still lingers round old and bygone forms of culture.  It takes from each what is serviceable for the modern spirit?from Athens its wonder without its worship, from Venice its splendour without its sin.  The same spirit is always analysing its own strength and its own weakness, counting what it owes to East and to West, to the olive-trees of Colonus and to the palm-trees of Lebanon, to Gethsemane and to the garden of Proserpine.  And yet the truths of art cannot be taught: they are revealed only, revealed to natures which have made themselves receptive of all beautiful impressions by the study and worship of all beautiful things.  And hence the enormous importance given to the decorative arts in our English Renaissance; hence all that marvel of design that comes from the hand of Edward Burne-Jones, all that weaving of tapestry and staining of glass, that beautiful working in clay and metal and wood which we owe to William Morris, the greatest handicraftsman we have had in England since the fourteenth century.  So, in years to come there will be nothing in any man's house which has not given delight to its maker and does not give delight to its user. The children, like the children of Plato's perfect city, will grow up ?in a simple atmosphere of all fair things??I quote from the passage in the _Republic_??a simple atmosphere of all fair things, where beauty, which is the spirit of art, will come on eye and ear like a fresh breath of wind that brings health from a clear upland, and insensibly and gradually draw the child's soul into harmony with all knowledge and all wisdom, so that he will love what is beautiful and good, and hate what is evil and ugly (for they always go together) long before he knows the reason why; and then when reason comes will kiss her on the cheek as a friend.?  That is what Plato thought decorative art could do for a nation, feeling that the secret not of philosophy merely but of all gracious existence might be externally hidden from any one whose youth had been passed in uncomely and vulgar surroundings, and that the beauty of form and colour even, as he says, in the meanest vessels of the house, will find its way into the inmost places of the soul and lead the boy naturally to look for that divine harmony of spiritual life of which art was to him the material symbol and warrant.  Prelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love of beautiful things be for us; yet there are times when wisdom becomes a burden and knowledge is one with sorrow: for as every body has its shadow so every soul has its scepticism.  In such dread moments of discord and despair where should we, of this torn and troubled age, turn our steps if not to that secure house of beauty where there is always a little forgetfulness, always a great joy; to that _citt? divina_, as the old Italian heresy called it, the divine city where one can stand, though only for a brief moment, apart from the division and terror of the world and the choice of the world too?  This is that _consolation des arts_ which is the key-note of Gautier's poetry, the secret of modern life foreshadowed?as indeed what in our century is not??by Goethe.  You remember what he said to the German people: ?Only have the courage,? he said, ?to give yourselves up to your impressions, allow yourselves to be delighted, moved, elevated, nay instructed, inspired for something great.?  The courage to give yourselves up to your impressions: yes, that is the secret of the artistic life?for while art has been defined as an escape from the tyranny of the senses, it is an escape rather from the tyranny of the soul.  But only to those who worship her above all things does she ever reveal her true treasure: else will she be as powerless to aid you as the mutilated Venus of the Louvre was before the romantic but sceptical nature of Heine.  And indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain that might follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to the maker of it and gives pleasure to its user, that being the simplest of all rules about decoration.  One thing, at least, I think it would do for us: there is no surer test of a great country than how near it stands to its own poets; but between the singers of our day and the workers to whom they would sing there seems to be an ever-widening and dividing chasm, a chasm which slander and mockery cannot traverse, but which is spanned by the luminous wings of love.  And of such love I think that the abiding presence in our houses of noble imaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation.  I do not mean merely as regards that direct literary expression of art by which, from the little red-and-black cruse of oil or wine, a Greek boy could learn of the lionlike splendour of Achilles, of the strength of Hector and the beauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen, long before he stood and listened in crowded market-place or in theatre of marble; or by which an Italian child of the fifteenth century could know of the chastity of Lucrece and the death of Camilla from carven doorway and from painted chest.  For the good we get from art is not what we learn from it; it is what we become through it.  Its real influence will be in giving the mind that enthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it to demand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of common life for us?whether it be by giving the most spiritual interpretation of one's own moments of highest passion or the most sensuous expression of those thoughts that are the farthest removed from sense; in accustoming it to love the things of the imagination for their own sake, and to desire beauty and grace in all things.  For he who does not love art in all things does not love it at all, and he who does not need art in all things does not need it at all.  I will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all in our great Gothic cathedrals.  I mean how the artist of that time, handicraftsman himself in stone or glass, found the best motives for his art, always ready for his hand and always beautiful, in the daily work of the artificers he saw around him?as in those lovely windows of Chartres?where the dyer dips in the vat and the potter sits at the wheel, and the weaver stands at the loom: real manufacturers these, workers with the hand, and entirely delightful to look at, not like the smug and vapid shopman of our time, who knows nothing of the web or vase he sells, except that he is charging you double its value and thinking you a fool for buying it.  Nor can I but just note, in passing, the immense influence the decorative work of Greece and Italy had on its artists, the one teaching the sculptor that restraining influence of design which is the glory of the Parthenon, the other keeping painting always true to its primary, pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret of the school of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lecture at least, to dwell on the effect that decorative art has on human life?on its social not its purely artistic effect.  There are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two different forms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action, and men to whom the end of life is thought.  As regards the latter, who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits of experience, who must burn always with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find life interesting not for its secret but for its situations, for its pulsations and not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow for love.  For art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but the highest quality to one's moments, and for those moments? sake.  So far for those to whom the end of life is thought.  As regards the others, who hold that life is inseparable from labour, to them should this movement be specially dear: for, if our days are barren without industry, industry without art is barbarism.  Hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us. Our modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all: but at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made receptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there will come no longer discontent but joy to the toiler.  For what is decoration but the worker's expression of joy in his work?  And not joy merely?that is a great thing yet not enough?but that opportunity of expressing his own individuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the source of all art.  ?I have tried,? I remember William Morris saying to me once, ?I have tried to make each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist I mean a man.?  For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he is, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his luxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has in it something beautiful and noble.  And so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far as possible, the right surroundings, for remember that the real test and virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industry even, but his power of design merely; and that ?design is not the offspring of idle fancy: it is the studied result of accumulative observation and delightful habit.? All the teaching in the world is of no avail if you do not surround your workman with happy influences and with beautiful things.  It is impossible for him to have right ideas about colour unless he sees the lovely colours of Nature unspoiled; impossible for him to supply beautiful incident and action unless he sees beautiful incident and action in the world about him.  For to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and thinking about them, and to cultivate admiration you must be among beautiful things and looking at them.  ?The steel of Toledo and the silk of Genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre to pride,? as Mr. Ruskin says; let it be for you to create an art that is made by the hands of the people for the joy of the people, to please the hearts of the people, too; an art that will be your expression of your delight in life.  There is nothing ?in common life too mean, in common things too trivial to be ennobled by your touch?; nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.  You have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers connected with the 'sthetic movement in England, and said (I assure you, erroneously) to be the food of some 'sthetic young men.  Well, let me tell you that the reason we love the lily and the sunflower, in spite of what Mr. Gilbert may tell you, is not for any vegetable fashion at all.  It is because these two lovely flowers are in England the two most perfect models of design, the most naturally adapted for decorative art?the gaudy leonine beauty of the one and the precious loveliness of the other giving to the artist the most entire and perfect joy.  And so with you: let there be no flower in your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils around your pillows, no little leaf in your Titan forests that does not lend its form to design, no curving spray of wild rose or brier that does not live for ever in carven arch or window or marble, no bird in your air that is not giving the iridescent wonder of its colour, the exquisite curves of its wings in flight, to make more precious the preciousness of simple adornment.  We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of life. Well, the secret of life is in art.     HOUSE DECORATION   A lecture delivered in America during Wilde's tour in 1882.  It was announced as a lecture on ?The Practical Application of the Principles of 'sthetic Theory to Exterior and Interior House Decoration, With Observations upon Dress and Personal Ornaments.?  The earliest date on which it is known to have been given is May 11, 1882.  IN my last lecture I gave you something of the history of Art in England. I sought to trace the influence of the French Revolution upon its development.  I said something of the song of Keats and the school of the pre-Raphaelites.  But I do not want to shelter the movement, which I have called the English Renaissance, under any palladium however noble, or any name however revered.  The roots of it have, indeed, to be sought for in things that have long passed away, and not, as some suppose, in the fancy of a few young men?although I am not altogether sure that there is anything much better than the fancy of a few young men.  When I appeared before you on a previous occasion, I had seen nothing of American art save the Doric columns and Corinthian chimney-pots visible on your Broadway and Fifth Avenue.  Since then, I have been through your country to some fifty or sixty different cities, I think.  I find that what your people need is not so much high imaginative art but that which hallows the vessels of everyday use.  I suppose that the poet will sing and the artist will paint regardless whether the world praises or blames. He has his own world and is independent of his fellow-men.  But the handicraftsman is dependent on your pleasure and opinion.  He needs your encouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings.  Your people love art but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman.  Of course, those millionaires who can pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no care to encourage such; but I speak for those whose desire for beautiful things is larger than their means.  I find that one great trouble all over is that your workmen are not given to noble designs.  You cannot be indifferent to this, because Art is not something which you can take or leave.  It is a necessity of human life.  And what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we call art? In the first place, it means value to the workman and it means the pleasure which he must necessarily take in making a beautiful thing.  The mark of all good art is not that the thing done is done exactly or finely, for machinery may do as much, but that it is worked out with the head and the workman's heart.  I cannot impress the point too frequently that beautiful and rational designs are necessary in all work.  I did not imagine, until I went into some of your simpler cities, that there was so much bad work done.  I found, where I went, bad wall-papers horribly designed, and coloured carpets, and that old offender the horse-hair sofa, whose stolid look of indifference is always so depressing.  I found meaningless chandeliers and machine-made furniture, generally of rosewood, which creaked dismally under the weight of the ubiquitous interviewer.  I came across the small iron stove which they always persist in decorating with machine-made ornaments, and which is as great a bore as a wet day or any other particularly dreadful institution.  When unusual extravagance was indulged in, it was garnished with two funeral urns.  It must always be remembered that what is well and carefully made by an honest workman, after a rational design, increases in beauty and value as the years go on.  The old furniture brought over by the Pilgrims, two hundred years ago, which I saw in New England, is just as good and as beautiful to-day as it was when it first came here.  Now, what you must do is to bring artists and handicraftsmen together.  Handicraftsmen cannot live, certainly cannot thrive, without such companionship. Separate these two and you rob art of all spiritual motive.  Having done this, you must place your workman in the midst of beautiful surroundings.  The artist is not dependent on the visible and the tangible.  He has his visions and his dreams to feed on.  But the workman must see lovely forms as he goes to his work in the morning and returns at eventide.  And, in connection with this, I want to assure you that noble and beautiful designs are never the result of idle fancy or purposeless day-dreaming.  They come only as the accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation.  And yet such things may not be taught.  Right ideas concerning them can certainly be obtained only by those who have been accustomed to rooms that are beautiful and colours that are satisfying.  Perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choose a notable and joyous dress for men.  There would be more joy in life if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the beautiful colours we can in fashioning our own clothes.  The dress of the future, I think, will use drapery to a great extent and will abound with joyous colour.  At present we have lost all nobility of dress and, in doing so, have almost annihilated the modern sculptor.  And, in looking around at the figures which adorn our parks, one could almost wish that we had completely killed the noble art.  To see the frock-coat of the drawing-room done in bronze, or the double waistcoat perpetuated in marble, adds a new horror to death.  But indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking an answer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that is either beautiful or appropriate.  One of the earliest forms is the Greek drapery which is exquisite for young girls.  And then, I think we may be pardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of the time of Charles I., so beautiful indeed, that in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers it was copied by the Puritans.  And the dress for the children of that time must not be passed over.  It was a very golden age of the little ones.  I do not think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in the pictures of that time.  The dress of the last century in England is also peculiarly gracious and graceful.  There is nothing bizarre or strange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty.  In these days, when we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern milliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more than once.  In the old days, when the dresses were decorated with beautiful designs and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladies rather took a pride in bringing out the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down to their daughters?a process that would, I think, be quite appreciated by a modern husband when called upon to settle his wife's bills.  And how shall men dress?  Men say that they do not particularly care how they dress, and that it is little matter.  I am bound to reply that I do not think that you do.  In all my journeys through the country, the only well-dressed men that I saw?and in saying this I earnestly deprecate the polished indignation of your Fifth Avenue dandies?were the Western miners.  Their wide-brimmed hats, which shaded their faces from the sun and protected them from the rain, and the cloak, which is by far the most beautiful piece of drapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with admiration.  Their high boots, too, were sensible and practical.  They wore only what was comfortable, and therefore beautiful.  As I looked at them I could not help thinking with regret of the time when these picturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go East to assume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire.  Indeed, so concerned was I that I made some of them promise that when they again appeared in the more crowded scenes of Eastern civilisation they would still continue to wear their lovely costume.  But I do not believe they will.  Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art.  Bad art is a great deal worse than no art at all.  You must show your workmen specimens of good work so that they come to know what is simple and true and beautiful.  To that end I would have you have a museum attached to these schools?not one of those dreadful modern institutions where there is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and a case or two of fossils, but a place where there are gathered examples of art decoration from various periods and countries.  Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in London, whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any other one thing.  There I go every Saturday night, when the museum is open later than usual, to see the handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the glass-blower and the worker in metals.  And it is here that the man of refinement and culture comes face to face with the workman who ministers to his joy.  He comes to know more of the nobility of the workman, and the workman, feeling the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility of his work.  You have too many white walls.  More colour is wanted.  You should have such men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy of colour. Take Mr. Whistler's ?Symphony in White,? which you no doubt have imagined to be something quite bizarre.  It is nothing of the sort.  Think of a cool grey sky flecked here and there with white clouds, a grey ocean and three wonderfully beautiful figures robed in white, leaning over the water and dropping white flowers from their fingers.  Here is no extensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and no metaphysics of which we have had quite enough in art.  But if the simple and unaided colour strike the right key-note, the whole conception is made clear.  I regard Mr. Whistler's famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour and art decoration which the world has known since Correggio painted that wonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancing on the walls.  Mr. Whistler finished another room just before I came away?a breakfast room in blue and yellow.  The ceiling was a light blue, the cabinet-work and the furniture were of a yellow wood, the curtains at the windows were white and worked in yellow, and when the table was set for breakfast with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so simple and so joyous.  The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that there is apparent no definite scheme of colour.  Everything is not attuned to a key-note as it should be.  The apartments are crowded with pretty things which have no relation to one another.  Again, your artists must decorate what is more simply useful.  In your art schools I found no attempt to decorate such things as the vessels for water.  I know of nothing uglier than the ordinary jug or pitcher.  A museum could be filled with the different kinds of water vessels which are used in hot countries.  Yet we continue to submit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side. I do not see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets and soup-plates with moonlight scenes.  I do not think it adds anything to the pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out of such glories. Besides, we do not want a soup-plate whose bottom seems to vanish in the distance.  One feels neither safe nor comfortable under such conditions. In fact, I did not find in the art schools of the country that the difference was explained between decorative and imaginative art.  The conditions of art should be simple.  A great deal more depends upon the heart than upon the head.  Appreciation of art is not secured by any elaborate scheme of learning.  Art requires a good healthy atmosphere. The motives for art are still around about us as they were round about the ancients.  And the subjects are also easily found by the earnest sculptor and the painter.  Nothing is more picturesque and graceful than a man at work.  The artist who goes to the children's playground, watches them at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the same themes that engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such observation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct that foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always divorced.  To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature been generous in furnishing material for art workers to work in.  You have marble quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any the Greeks ever had for their beautiful work, and yet day after day I am confronted with the great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful material as if it were not precious almost beyond speech.  Marble should not be used save by noble workmen.  There is nothing which gave me a greater sense of barrenness in travelling through the country than the entire absence of wood carving on your houses.  Wood carving is the simplest of the decorative arts.  In Switzerland the little barefooted boy beautifies the porch of his father's house with examples of skill in this direction.  Why should not American boys do a great deal more and better than Swiss boys?  There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more vulgar in execution than modern jewellery.  This is something that can easily be corrected.  Something better should be made out of the beautiful gold which is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn along your river beds.  When I was at Leadville and reflected that all the shining silver that I saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars, it made me sad.  It should be made into something more permanent.  The golden gates at Flor|2
46|ence are as beautiful to-day as when Michael Angelo saw them.  We should see more of the workman than we do.  We should not be content to have the salesman stand between us?the salesman who knows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it. And watching the workman will teach that most important lesson?the nobility of all rational workmanship.  I said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood among men by furnishing a universal language.  I said that under its beneficent influences war might pass away.  Thinking this, what place can I ascribe to art in our education?  If children grow up among all fair and lovely things, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they know the reason why.  If you go into a house where everything is coarse, you find things chipped and broken and unsightly.  Nobody exercises any care.  If everything is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of manner are unconsciously acquired.  When I was in San Francisco I used to visit the Chinese Quarter frequently.  There I used to watch a great hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal of a flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter thick.  I think I have deserved something nicer.  The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who looked upon human beings as obstructions.  They have tried to educate boys? minds before they had any.  How much better it would be in these early years to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of mankind.  I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts.  It would be a golden hour to the children.  And you would soon raise up a race of handicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country.  I have seen only one such school in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia and was founded by my friend Mr. Leyland.  I stopped there yesterday and have brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you.  Here are two disks of beaten brass: the designs on them are beautiful, the workmanship is simple, and the entire result is satisfactory.  The work was done by a little boy twelve years old.  This is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl of thirteen.  The design is lovely and the colouring delicate and pretty.  Here you see a piece of beautiful wood carving accomplished by a little boy of nine.  In such work as this, children learn sincerity in art.  They learn to abhor the liar in art?the man who paints wood to look like iron, or iron to look like stone.  It is a practical school of morals.  No better way is there to learn to love Nature than to understand Art.  It dignifies every flower of the field. And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing becomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the customary stone.  What we want is something spiritual added to life. Nothing is so ignoble that Art cannot sanctify it.     ART AND THE HANDICRAFTSMAN   The fragments of which this lecture is composed are taken entirely from the original manuscripts which have but recently been discovered.  It is not certain that they all belong to the same lecture, nor that all were written at the same period.  Some portions were written in Philadelphia in 1882.  PEOPLE often talk as if there was an opposition between what is beautiful and what is useful.  There is no opposition to beauty except ugliness: all things are either beautiful or ugly, and utility will be always on the side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is always on the side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is always an expression of the use you put a thing to and the value placed on it.  No workman will beautifully decorate bad work, nor can you possibly get good handicraftsmen or workmen without having beautiful designs.  You should be quite sure of that.  If you have poor and worthless designs in any craft or trade you will get poor and worthless workmen only, but the minute you have noble and beautiful designs, then you get men of power and intellect and feeling to work for you.  By having good designs you have workmen who work not merely with their hands but with their hearts and heads too; otherwise you will get merely the fool or the loafer to work for you.  That the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose few people would venture to assert.  And yet most civilised people act as if it were of none, and in so doing are wronging both themselves and those that are to come after them.  For that beauty which is meant by art is no mere accident of human life which people can take or leave, but a positive necessity of life if we are to live as nature meant us to, that is to say unless we are content to be less than men.  Do not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of your life and cities here is opposed to art.  Who built the beautiful cities of the world but commercial men and commercial men only?  Genoa built by its traders, Florence by its bankers, and Venice, most lovely of all, by its noble and honest merchants.  I do not wish you, remember, ?to build a new Pisa,? nor to bring ?the life or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again.?  ?The circumstances with which you must surround your workmen are those? of modern American life, ?because the designs you have now to ask for from your workmen are such as will make modern? American ?life beautiful.? The art we want is the art based on all the inventions of modern civilisation, and to suit all the needs of nineteenth-century life.  Do you think, for instance, that we object to machinery?  I tell you we reverence it; we reverence it when it does its proper work, when it relieves man from ignoble and soulless labour, not when it seeks to do that which is valuable only when wrought by the hands and hearts of men. Let us have no machine-made ornament at all; it is all bad and worthless and ugly.  And let us not mistake the means of civilisation for the end of civilisation; steam-engine, telephone and the like, are all wonderful, but remember that their value depends entirely on the noble uses we make of them, on the noble spirit in which we employ them, not on the things themselves.  It is, no doubt, a great advantage to talk to a man at the Antipodes through a telephone; its advantage depends entirely on the value of what the two men have to say to one another.  If one merely shrieks slander through a tube and the other whispers folly into a wire, do not think that anybody is very much benefited by the invention.  The train that whirls an ordinary Englishman through Italy at the rate of forty miles an hour and finally sends him home without any memory of that lovely country but that he was cheated by a courier at Rome, or that he got a bad dinner at Verona, does not do him or civilisation much good. But that swift legion of fiery-footed engines that bore to the burning ruins of Chicago the loving help and generous treasure of the world was as noble and as beautiful as any golden troop of angels that ever fed the hungry and clothed the naked in the antique times.  As beautiful, yes; all machinery may be beautiful when it is undecorated even.  Do not seek to decorate it.  We cannot but think all good machinery is graceful, also, the line of strength and the line of beauty being one.  Give then, as I said, to your workmen of to-day the bright and noble surroundings that you can yourself create.  Stately and simple architecture for your cities, bright and simple dress for your men and women; those are the conditions of a real artistic movement.  For the artist is not concerned primarily with any theory of life but with life itself, with the joy and loveliness that should come daily on eye and ear for a beautiful external world.  But the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright colour gaudy. For all beautiful colours are graduated colours, the colours that seem about to pass into one another's realm?colour without tone being like music without harmony, mere discord.  Barren architecture, the vulgar and glaring advertisements that desecrate not merely your cities but every rock and river that I have seen yet in America?all this is not enough.  A school of design we must have too in each city.  It should be a stately and noble building, full of the best examples of the best art of the world.  Furthermore, do not put your designers in a barren whitewashed room and bid them work in that depressing and colourless atmosphere as I have seen many of the American schools of design, but give them beautiful surroundings.  Because you want to produce a permanent canon and standard of taste in your workman, he must have always by him and before him specimens of the best decorative art of the world, so that you can say to him: ?This is good work.  Greek or Italian or Japanese wrought it so many years ago, but it is eternally young because eternally beautiful.?  Work in this spirit and you will be sure to be right.  Do not copy it, but work with the same love, the same reverence, the same freedom of imagination.  You must teach him colour and design, how all beautiful colours are graduated colours and glaring colours the essence of vulgarity.  Show him the quality of any beautiful work of nature like the rose, or any beautiful work of art like an Eastern carpet?being merely the exquisite gradation of colour, one tone answering another like the answering chords of a symphony.  Teach him how the true designer is not he who makes the design and then colours it, but he who designs in colour, creates in colour, thinks in colour too.  Show him how the most gorgeous stained-glass windows of Europe are filled with white glass, and the most gorgeous Eastern tapestry with toned colours?the primary colours in both places being set in the white glass, and the tone colours like brilliant jewels set in dusky gold.  And then as regards design, show him how the real designer will take first any given limited space, little disk of silver, it may be, like a Greek coin, or wide expanse of fretted ceiling or lordly wall as Tintoret chose at Venice (it does not matter which), and to this limited space?the first condition of decoration being the limitation of the size of the material used?he will give the effect of its being filled with beautiful decoration, filled with it as a golden cup will be filled with wine, so complete that you should not be able to take away anything from it or add anything to it.  For from a good piece of design you can take away nothing, nor can you add anything to it, each little bit of design being as absolutely necessary and as vitally important to the whole effect as a note or chord of music is for a sonata of Beethoven.  But I said the effect of its being so filled, because this, again, is of the essence of good design.  With a simple spray of leaves and a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the impression that he has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows the exact spot in which to place them.  All good design depends on the texture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to.  One of the first things I saw in an American school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large round dish, and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paint them on dinner plates or dishes.  Let them take canvas or paper for such work, but not clay or china.  They are merely painting the wrong subjects on the wrong material, that is all.  They have not been taught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own. The design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the design which you should work on a flat table-cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one will always be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too one puts the object to should guide one in the choice of design.  One does not want to eat one's terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor one's clams off a harrowing sunset.  Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by our landscape artist and be on the walls of the rooms we sit in to remind us of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not let us eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.  All these things are simple enough, yet nearly always forgotten.  Your school of design here will teach your girls and your boys, your handicraftsmen of the future (for all your schools of art should be local schools, the schools of particular cities).  We talk of the Italian school of painting, but there is no Italian school; there were the schools of each city.  Every town in Italy, from Venice itself, queen of the sea, to the little hill fortress of Perugia, each had its own school of art, each different and all beautiful.  So do not mind what art Philadelphia or New York is having, but make by the hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the joy of your own citizens, for you have here the primary elements of a great artistic movement.  For, believe me, the conditions of art are much simpler than people imagine.  For the noblest art one requires a clear healthy atmosphere, not polluted as the air of our English cities is by the smoke and grime and horridness which comes from open furnace and from factory chimney. You must have strong, sane, healthy physique among your men and women. Sickly or idle or melancholy people do not do much in art.  And lastly, you require a sense of individualism about each man and woman, for this is the essence of art?a desire on the part of man to express himself in the noblest way possible.  And this is the reason that the grandest art of the world always came from a republic: Athens, Venice, and Florence?there were no kings there and so their art was as noble and simple as sincere.  But if you want to know what kind of art the folly of kings will impose on a country look at the decorative art of France under the _grand monarque_, under Louis the Fourteenth; the gaudy gilt furniture writhing under a sense of its own horror and ugliness, with a nymph smirking at every angle and a dragon mouthing on every claw. Unreal and monstrous art this, and fit only for such periwigged pomposities as the nobility of France at that time, but not at all fit for you or me.  We do not want the rich to possess more beautiful things but the poor to create more beautiful things; for ever man is poor who cannot create.  Nor shall the art which you and I need be merely a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of some leprous king to adorn or to conceal the sin of his luxury, but rather shall it be the noble and beautiful expression of a people's noble and beautiful life.  Art shall be again the most glorious of all the chords through which the spirit of a great nation finds its noblest utterance.  All around you, I said, lie the conditions for a great artistic movement for every great art.  Let us think of one of them; a sculptor, for instance.  If a modern sculptor were to come and say, ?Very well, but where can one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frock-coats and chimney-pot hats?? I would tell him to go to the docks of a great city and watch the men loading or unloading the stately ships, working at wheel or windlass, hauling at rope or gangway.  I have never watched a man do anything useful who has not been graceful at some moment of his labour: it is only the loafer and the idle saunterer who is as useless and uninteresting to the artist as he is to himself.  I would ask the sculptor to go with me to any of your schools or universities, to the running ground and gymnasium, to watch the young men start for a race, hurling quoit or club, kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping, stepping from the boat or bending to the oar, and to carve them; and when he was weary of cities I would ask him to come to your fields and meadows to watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattle-driver with lifted lasso.  For if a man cannot find the noblest motives for his art in such simple daily things as a woman drawing water from the well or a man leaning with his scythe, he will not find them anywhere at all.  Gods and goddesses the Greek carved because he loved them; saint and king the Goth because he believed in them.  But you, you do not care much for Greek gods and goddesses, and you are perfectly and entirely right; and you do not think much of kings either, and you are quite right.  But what you do love are your own men and women, your own flowers and fields, your own hills and mountains, and these are what your art should represent to you.  Ours has been the first movement which has brought the handicraftsman and the artist together, for remember that by separating the one from the other you do ruin to both; you rob the one of all spiritual motive and all imaginative joy, you isolate the other from all real technical perfection.  The two greatest schools of art in the world, the sculptor at Athens and the school of painting at Venice, had their origin entirely in a long succession of simple and earnest handicraftsmen.  It was the Greek potter who taught the sculptor that restraining influence of design which was the glory of the Parthenon; it was the Italian decorator of chests and household goods who kept Venetian painting always true to its primary pictorial condition of noble colour.  For we should remember that all the arts are fine arts and all the arts decorative arts.  The greatest triumph of Italian painting was the decoration of a pope's chapel in Rome and the wall of a room in Venice.  Michael Angelo wrought the one, and Tintoret, the dyer's son, the other.  And the little ?Dutch landscape, which you put over your sideboard to-day, and between the windows to-morrow, is? no less a glorious ?piece of work than the extents of field and forest with which Benozzo has made green and beautiful the once melancholy arcade of the Campo Santo at Pisa,? as Ruskin says.  Do not imitate the works of a nation, Greek or Japanese, Italian or English; but their artistic spirit of design and their artistic attitude to-day, their own world, you should absorb but imitate never, copy never. Unless you can make as beautiful a design in painted china or embroidered screen or beaten brass out of your American turkey as the Japanese does out of his grey silver-winged stork, you will never do anything.  Let the Greek carve his lions and the Goth his dragons: buffalo and wild deer are the animals for you.  Golden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover your valleys in the spring and your hills in the autumn: let them be the flowers for your art.  Not merely has Nature given you the noblest motives for a new school of decoration, but to you above all other countries has she given the utensils to work in.  You have quarries of marble richer than Pentelicus, more varied than Paros, but do not build a great white square house of marble and think that it is beautiful, or that you are using marble nobly.  If you build in marble you must either carve it into joyous decoration, like the lives of dancing children that adorn the marble castles of the Loire, or fill it with beautiful sculpture, frieze and pediment, as the Greeks did, or inlay it with other coloured marbles as they did in Venice.  Otherwise you had better build in simple red brick as your Puritan fathers, with no pretence and with some beauty.  Do not treat your marble as if it was ordinary stone and build a house of mere blocks of it.  For it is indeed a precious stone, this marble of yours, and only workmen of nobility of invention and delicacy of hand should be allowed to touch it at all, carving it into noble statues or into beautiful decoration, or inlaying it with other coloured marbles: for ?the true colours of architecture are those of natural stone, and I would fain see them taken advantage of to the full.  Every variety is here, from pale yellow to purple passing through orange, red, and brown, entirely at your command; nearly every kind of green and grey also is attainable, and with these and with pure white what harmony might you not achieve.  Of stained and variegated stone the quantity is unlimited, the kinds innumerable.  Were brighter colours required, let glass, and gold protected by glass, be used in mosaic, a kind of work as durable as the solid stone and incapable of losing its lustre by time.  And let the painter's work be reserved for the shadowed loggia and inner chamber.  ?This is the true and faithful way of building.  Where this cannot be, the device of external colouring may indeed be employed without dishonour?but it must be with the warning reflection that a time will come when such aids will pass away and when the building will be judged in its lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin.  Better the less bright, more enduring fabric.  The transparent alabasters of San Miniato and the mosaics of Saint Mark's are more warmly filled and more brightly touched by every return of morning and evening, while the hues of the Gothic cathedrals have died like the iris out of the cloud, and the temples, whose azure and purple once flamed above the Grecian promontory, stand in their faded whiteness like snows which the sunset has left cold.??Ruskin, _Seven Lamps of Architecture_, II.  I do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as most modern jewellery.  How easy for you to change that and to produce goldsmiths? work that would be a joy to all of us.  The gold is ready for you in unexhausted treasure, stored up in the mountain hollow or strewn on the river sand, and was not given to you merely for barren speculation. There should be some better record of it left in your history than the merchant's panic and the ruined home.  We do not remember often enough how constantly the history of a great nation will live in and by its art. Only a few thin wreaths of beaten gold remain to tell us of the stately empire of Etruria; and, while from the streets of Florence the noble knight and haughty duke have long since passed away, the gates which the simple goldsmith Ghiberti made for their pleasure still guard their lovely house of baptism, worthy still of the praise of Michael Angelo who called them worthy to be the Gates of Paradise.  Have then your school of design, search out your workmen and, when you find one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of invention necessary for goldsmiths? work, do not leave him to toil in obscurity and dishonour and have a great glaring shop and two great glaring shop-boys in it (not to take your orders: they never do that; but to force you to buy something you do not want at all).  When you want a thing wrought in gold, goblet or shield for the feast, necklace or wreath for the women, tell him what you like most in decoration, flower or wreath, bird in flight or hound in the chase, image of the woman you love or the friend you honour.  Watch him as he beats out the gold into those thin plates delicate as the petals of a yellow rose, or draws it into the long wires like tangled sunbeams at dawn.  Whoever that workman be, help him, cherish him, and you will have such lovely work from his hand as will be a joy to you for all time.  This is the spirit of our movement in England, and this is the spirit in which we would wish you to work, making eternal by your art all that is noble in your men and women, stately in your lakes and mountains, beautiful in your own flowers and natural life.  We want to see that you have nothing in your houses that has not been a joy to the man who made it, and is not a joy to those that use it.  We want to see you create an art made by the hands of the people to please the hearts of the people too.  Do you like this spirit or not?  Do you think it simple and strong, noble in its aim, and beautiful in its result?  I know you do.  Folly and slander have their own way for a little time, but for a little time only.  You now know what we mean: you will be able to estimate what is said of us?its value and its motive.  There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed to write about art.  The harm they do by their foolish and random writing it would be impossible to overestimate?not to the artist but to the public, blinding them to all, but harming the artist not at all.  Without them we would judge a man simply by his work; but at present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge a sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the way he treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and a poet by the colour of his neck-tie.  I said there should be a law, but there is really no necessity for a new law: nothing could be easier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head of the criminal classes.  But let us leave such an inartistic subject and return to beautiful and comely things, remembering that the art which would represent the spirit of modern newspapers would be exactly the art which you and I want to avoid?grotesque art, malice mocking you from every gateway, slander sneering at you from every corner.  Perhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and the workman. You have heard of me, I fear, through the medium of your somewhat imaginative newspapers as, if not a ?Japanese young man,? at least a young man to whom the rush and clamour and reality of the modern world were distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty in life was the difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china?a paradox from which England has not yet recovered.  Well, let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create an artistic movement in England, a movement to show the rich what beautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful things they might create.  One summer afternoon in Oxford??that sweet city with her dreaming spires,? lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learning as Rome, down the long High Street that winds from tower to tower, past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light cast-iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in England)?well, we were coming down the street?a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or cricket-field?when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us.  He seemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which a few of us did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life, saying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and strength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket ground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do good to other people, at something by which we might show that in all labour there was something noble.  Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything he wished.  So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, so that the villagers could not pass from one to the other without many miles of a round.  And when we came back in winter he asked us to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people to use.  So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank?a very difficult thing to do.  And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us from the bank.  We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it aft|2
47|erwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road.  And what became of the road?  Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly?in the middle of the swamp.  Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the next term there was no leader, and the ?diggers,? as they called us, fell asunder.  And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the young men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble ideal of life, I could from them create an artistic movement that might change, as it has changed, the face of England.  So I sought them out?leader they would call me?but there was no leader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by noble art.  There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers, determined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for the handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and pictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.  Well, we have done something in England and we will do something more. Now, I do not want you, believe me, to ask your brilliant young men, your beautiful young girls, to go out and make a road on a swamp for any village in America, but I think you might each of you have some art to practise.                                  * * * * *  We must have, as Emerson said, a mechanical craft for our culture, a basis for our higher accomplishments in the work of our hands?the uselessness of most people's hands seems to me one of the most unpractical things.  ?No separation from labour can be without some loss of power or truth to the seer,? says Emerson again.  The heroism which would make on us the impression of Epaminondas must be that of a domestic conqueror.  The hero of the future is he who shall bravely and gracefully subdue this Gorgon of fashion and of convention.  When you have chosen your own part, abide by it, and do not weakly try and reconcile yourself with the world.  The heroic cannot be the common nor the common the heroic.  Congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age.  And lastly, let us remember that art is the one thing which Death cannot harm.  The little house at Concord may be desolate, but the wisdom of New England's Plato is not silenced nor the brilliancy of that Attic genius dimmed: the lips of Longfellow are still musical for us though his dust be turning into the flowers which he loved: and as it is with the greater artists, poet and philosopher and song-bird, so let it be with you.     LECTURE TO ART STUDENTS   Delivered to the Art students of the Royal Academy at their Club in Golden Square, Westminster, on June 30, 1883.  The text is taken from the original manuscript.  IN the lecture which it is my privilege to deliver before you to-night I do not desire to give you any abstract definition of beauty at all.  For we who are working in art cannot accept any theory of beauty in exchange for beauty itself, and, so far from desiring to isolate it in a formula appealing to the intellect, we, on the contrary, seek to materialise it in a form that gives joy to the soul through the senses.  We want to create it, not to define it.  The definition should follow the work: the work should not adapt itself to the definition.  Nothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than any conception of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either into weak prettiness or lifeless abstraction: whereas to touch the ideal at all you must not strip it of vitality.  You must find it in life and re-create it in art.  While, then, on the one hand I do not desire to give you any philosophy of beauty?for, what I want to-night is to investigate how we can create art, not how we can talk of it?on the other hand, I do not wish to deal with anything like a history of English art.  To begin with, such an expression as English art is a meaningless expression.  One might just as well talk of English mathematics.  Art is the science of beauty, and Mathematics the science of truth: there is no national school of either.  Indeed, a national school is a provincial school, merely.  Nor is there any such thing as a school of art even. There are merely artists, that is all.  And as regards histories of art, they are quite valueless to you unless you are seeking the ostentatious oblivion of an art professorship.  It is of no use to you to know the date of Perugino or the birthplace of Salvator Rosa: all that you should learn about art is to know a good picture when you see it, and a bad picture when you see it.  As regards the date of the artist, all good work looks perfectly modern: a piece of Greek sculpture, a portrait of Velasquez?they are always modern, always of our time.  And as regards the nationality of the artist, art is not national but universal.  As regards arch?ology, then, avoid it altogether: arch?ology is merely the science of making excuses for bad art; it is the rock on which many a young artist founders and shipwrecks; it is the abyss from which no artist, old or young, ever returns.  Or, if he does return, he is so covered with the dust of ages and the mildew of time, that he is quite unrecognisable as an artist, and has to conceal himself for the rest of his days under the cap of a professor, or as a mere illustrator of ancient history.  How worthless arch?ology is in art you can estimate by the fact of its being so popular.  Popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art.  Whatever is popular is wrong.  As I am not going to talk to you, then, about the philosophy of the beautiful, or the history of art, you will ask me what I am going to talk about.  The subject of my lecture to-night is what makes an artist and what does the artist make; what are the relations of the artist to his surroundings, what is the education the artist should get, and what is the quality of a good work of art.  Now, as regards the relations of the artist to his surroundings, by which I mean the age and country in which he is born.  All good art, as I said before, has nothing to do with any particular century; but this universality is the quality of the work of art; the conditions that produce that quality are different.  And what, I think, you should do is to realise completely your age in order completely to abstract yourself from it; remembering that if you are an artist at all, you will be not the mouthpiece of a century, but the master of eternity, that all art rests on a principle, and that mere temporal considerations are no principle at all; and that those who advise you to make your art representative of the nineteenth century are advising you to produce an art which your children, when you have them, will think old-fashioned. But you will tell me this is an inartistic age, and we are an inartistic people, and the artist suffers much in this nineteenth century of ours.  Of course he does.  I, of all men, am not going to deny that.  But remember that there never has been an artistic age, or an artistic people, since the beginning of the world.  The artist has always been, and will always be, an exquisite exception.  There is no golden age of art; only artists who have produced what is more golden than gold.  _What_, you will say to me, the Greeks? were not they an artistic people?  Well, the Greeks certainly not, but, perhaps, you mean the Athenians, the citizens of one out of a thousand cities.  Do you think that they were an artistic people?  Take them even at the time of their highest artistic development, the latter part of the fifth century before Christ, when they had the greatest poets and the greatest artists of the antique world, when the Parthenon rose in loveliness at the bidding of a Phidias, and the philosopher spake of wisdom in the shadow of the painted portico, and tragedy swept in the perfection of pageant and pathos across the marble of the stage.  Were they an artistic people then?  Not a bit of it.  What is an artistic people but a people who love their artists and understand their art?  The Athenians could do neither.  How did they treat Phidias?  To Phidias we owe the great era, not merely in Greek, but in all art?I mean of the introduction of the use of the living model.  And what would you say if all the English bishops, backed by the English people, came down from Exeter Hall to the Royal Academy one day and took off Sir Frederick Leighton in a prison van to Newgate on the charge of having allowed you to make use of the living model in your designs for sacred pictures?  Would you not cry out against the barbarism and the Puritanism of such an idea?  Would you not explain to them that the worst way to honour God is to dishonour man who is made in His image, and is the work of His hands; and, that if one wants to paint Christ one must take the most Christlike person one can find, and if one wants to paint the Madonna, the purest girl one knows?  Would you not rush off and burn down Newgate, if necessary, and say that such a thing was without parallel in history?  Without parallel?  Well, that is exactly what the Athenians did.  In the room of the Parthenon marbles, in the British Museum, you will see a marble shield on the wall.  On it there are two figures; one of a man whose face is half hidden, the other of a man with the godlike lineaments of Pericles.  For having done this, for having introduced into a bas relief, taken from Greek sacred history, the image of the great statesman who was ruling Athens at the time, Phidias was flung into prison and there, in the common gaol of Athens, died, the supreme artist of the old world.  And do you think that this was an exceptional case?  The sign of a Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art, and this cry was raised by the Athenian people against every great poet and thinker of their day?'schylus, Euripides, Socrates.  It was the same with Florence in the thirteenth century.  Good handicrafts are due to guilds, not to the people.  The moment the guilds lost their power and the people rushed in, beauty and honesty of work died.  And so, never talk of an artistic people; there never has been such a thing.  But, perhaps, you will tell me that the external beauty of the world has almost entirely passed away from us, that the artist dwells no longer in the midst of the lovely surroundings which, in ages past, were the natural inheritance of every one, and that art is very difficult in this unlovely town of ours, where, as you go to your work in the morning, or return from it at eventide, you have to pass through street after street of the most foolish and stupid architecture that the world has ever seen; architecture, where every lovely Greek form is desecrated and defiled, and every lovely Gothic form defiled and desecrated, reducing three-fourths of the London houses to being, merely, like square boxes of the vilest proportions, as gaunt as they are grimy, and as poor as they are pretentious?the hall door always of the wrong colour, and the windows of the wrong size, and where, even when wearied of the houses you turn to contemplate the street itself, you have nothing to look at but chimney-pot hats, men with sandwich boards, vermilion letter-boxes, and do that even at the risk of being run over by an emerald-green omnibus.  Is not art difficult, you will say to me, in such surroundings as these? Of course it is difficult, but then art was never easy; you yourselves would not wish it to be easy; and, besides, nothing is worth doing except what the world says is impossible.  Still, you do not care to be answered merely by a paradox.  What are the relations of the artist to the external world, and what is the result of the loss of beautiful surroundings to you, is one of the most important questions of modern art; and there is no point on which Mr. Ruskin so insists as that the decadence of art has come from the decadence of beautiful things; and that when the artist cannot feed his eye on beauty, beauty goes from his work.  I remember in one of his lectures, after describing the sordid aspect of a great English city, he draws for us a picture of what were the artistic surroundings long ago.  Think, he says, in words of perfect and picturesque imagery, whose beauty I can but feebly echo, think of what was the scene which presented itself, in his afternoon walk, to a designer of the Gothic school of Pisa?Nino Pisano or any of his men: {206}      On each side of a bright river he saw rise a line of brighter     palaces, arched and pillared, and inlaid with deep red porphyry, and     with serpentine; along the quays before their gates were riding     troops of knights, noble in face and form, dazzling in crest and     shield; horse and man one labyrinth of quaint colour and gleaming     light?the purple, and silver, and scarlet fringes flowing over the     strong limbs and clashing mall, like sea-waves over rocks at sunset.     Opening on each side from the river were gardens, courts, and     cloisters; long successions of white pillars among wreaths of vine;     leaping of fountains through buds of pomegranate and orange: and     still along the garden-paths, and under and through the crimson of     the pomegranate shadows, moving slowly, groups of the fairest women     that Italy ever saw?fairest, because purest and thoughtfullest;     trained in all high knowledge, as in all courteous art?in dance, in     song, in sweet wit, in lofty learning, in loftier courage, in     loftiest love?able alike to cheer, to enchant, or save, the souls of     men.  Above all this scenery of perfect human life, rose dome and     bell-tower, burning with white alabaster and gold: beyond dome and     bell-tower the slopes of mighty hills hoary with olive; far in the     north, above a purple sea of peaks of solemn Apennine, the clear,     sharp-cloven Carrara mountains sent up their steadfast flames of     marble summit into amber sky; the great sea itself, scorching with     expanse of light, stretching from their feet to the Gorgonian isles;     and over all these, ever present, near or far'seen through the leaves     of vine, or imaged with all its march of clouds in the Arno's stream,     or set with its depth of blue close against the golden hair and     burning cheek of lady and knight,?that untroubled and sacred sky,     which was to all men, in those days of innocent faith, indeed the     unquestioned abode of spirits, as the earth was of men; and which     opened straight through its gates of cloud and veils of dew into the     awfulness of the eternal world;?a heaven in which every cloud that     passed was literally the chariot of an angel, and every ray of its     Evening and Morning streamed from the throne of God.      What think you of that for a school of design?  And then look at the depressing, monotonous appearance of any modern city, the sombre dress of men and women, the meaningless and barren architecture, the colourless and dreadful surroundings.  Without a beautiful national life, not sculpture merely, but all the arts will die.  Well, as regards the religious feeling of the close of the passage, I do not think I need speak about that.  Religion springs from religious feeling, art from artistic feeling: you never get one from the other; unless you have the right root you will not get the right flower; and, if a man sees in a cloud the chariot of an angel, he will probably paint it very unlike a cloud.  But, as regards the general idea of the early part of that lovely bit of prose, is it really true that beautiful surroundings are necessary for the artist?  I think not; I am sure not.  Indeed, to me the most inartistic thing in this age of ours is not the indifference of the public to beautiful things, but the indifference of the artist to the things that are called ugly.  For, to the real artist, nothing is beautiful or ugly in itself at all.  With the facts of the object he has nothing to do, but with its appearance only, and appearance is a matter of light and shade, of masses, of position, and of value.  Appearance is, in fact, a matter of effect merely, and it is with the effects of nature that you have to deal, not with the real condition of the object.  What you, as painters, have to paint is not things as they are but things as they seem to be, not things as they are but things as they are not.  No object is so ugly that, under certain conditions of light and shade, or proximity to other things, it will not look beautiful; no object is so beautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly.  I believe that in every twenty-four hours what is beautiful looks ugly, and what is ugly looks beautiful, once.  And, the commonplace character of so much of our English painting seems to me due to the fact that so many of our young artists look merely at what we may call ?ready-made beauty,? whereas you exist as artists not to copy beauty but to create it in your art, to wait and watch for it in nature.  What would you say of a dramatist who would take nobody but virtuous people as characters in his play?  Would you not say he was missing half of life?  Well, of the young artist who paints nothing but beautiful things, I say he misses one half of the world.  Do not wait for life to be picturesque, but try and see life under picturesque conditions.  These conditions you can create for yourself in your studio, for they are merely conditions of light.  In nature, you must wait for them, watch for them, choose them; and, if you wait and watch, come they will.  In Gower Street at night you may see a letter-box that is picturesque: on the Thames Embankment you may see picturesque policemen.  Even Venice is not always beautiful, nor France.  To paint what you see is a good rule in art, but to see what is worth painting is better.  See life under pictorial conditions.  It is better to live in a city of changeable weather than in a city of lovely surroundings.  Now, having seen what makes the artist, and what the artist makes, who is the artist?  There is a man living amongst us who unites in himself all the qualities of the noblest art, whose work is a joy for all time, who is, himself, a master of all time.  That man is Mr. Whistler.                                  * * * * *  But, you will say, modern dress, that is bad.  If you cannot paint black cloth you could not have painted silken doublet.  Ugly dress is better for art?facts of vision, not of the object.  What is a picture?  Primarily, a picture is a beautifully coloured surface, merely, with no more spiritual message or meaning for you than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall of Damascus.  It is, primarily, a purely decorative thing, a delight to look at.  All arch?ological pictures that make you say ?How curious!? all sentimental pictures that make you say, ?How sad!? all historical pictures that make you say ?How interesting!? all pictures that do not immediately give you such artistic joy as to make you say ?How beautiful!? are bad pictures.                                  * * * * *  We never know what an artist is going to do.  Of course not.  The artist is not a specialist.  All such divisions as animal painters, landscape painters, painters of Scotch cattle in an English mist, painters of English cattle in a Scotch mist, racehorse painters, bull-terrier painters, all are shallow.  If a man is an artist he can paint everything.  The object of art is to stir the most divine and remote of the chords which make music in our soul; and colour is indeed, of itself a mystical presence on things, and tone a kind of sentinel.  Am I pleading, then, for mere technique?  No.  As long as there are any signs of technique at all, the picture is unfinished.  What is finish?  A picture is finished when all traces of work, and of the means employed to bring about the result, have disappeared.  In the case of handicraftsmen?the weaver, the potter, the smith?on their work are the traces of their hand.  But it is not so with the painter; it is not so with the artist.  Art should have no sentiment about it but its beauty, no technique except what you cannot observe.  One should be able to say of a picture not that it is ?well painted,? but that it is ?not painted.?  What is the difference between absolutely decorative art and a painting? Decorative art emphasises its material: imaginative art annihilates it. Tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates its canvas: it shows nothing of it.  Porcelain emphasises its glaze: water-colours reject the paper.  A picture has no meaning but its beauty, no message but its joy.  That is the first truth about art that you must never lose sight of.  A picture is a purely decorative thing.     LONDON MODELS   _English Illustrated Magazine_, January 1889.  PROFESSIONAL models are a purely modern invention.  To the Greeks, for instance, they were quite unknown.  Mr. Mahaffy, it is true, tells us that Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of Athenian society in order to induce them to sit to his friend Phidias, and we know that Polygnotus introduced into his picture of the Trojan women the face of Elpinice, the celebrated sister of the great Conservative leader of the day, but these _grandes dames_ clearly do not come under our category.  As for the old masters, they undoubtedly made constant studies from their pupils and apprentices, and even their religious pictures are full of the portraits of their friends and relations, but they do not seem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class of people whose sole profession is to pose.  In fact the model, in our sense of the word, is the direct creation of Academic Schools.  Every country now has its own models, except America.  In New York, and even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity that most of the artists are reduced to painting Niagara and millionaires.  In Europe, however, it is different.  Here we have plenty of models, and of every nationality.  The Italian models are the best.  The natural grace of their attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their colouring, makes them facile?often too facile'subjects for the painter's brush.  The French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian, possess a quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of understanding the artist, which is quite remarkable.  They have also a great command over the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly dramatic, and can chatter the _argot_ of the _atelier_ as cleverly as the critic of the _Gil Blas_.  The English models form a class entirely by themselves.  They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor so clever as the French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so to speak, of their order.  Now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door, and proposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the blasted heath.  One of them some time ago called on a popular painter who, happening at the moment to require his services, engaged him, and told him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer.  ?Shall I be Biblical or Shakespearean, sir?? asked the veteran. ?Well?Shakespearean,? answered the artist, wondering by what subtle _nuance_ of expression the model would convey the difference.  ?All right, sir,? said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and began to wink with his left eye!  This class, however, is dying out.  As a rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to twenty-five years of age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is merely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much trouble.  English models rarely look at a picture, and never venture on any 'sthetic theories.  In fact, they realise very completely Mr. Whistler's idea of the function of an art critic, for they pass no criticisms at all.  They accept all schools of art with the grand catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a fantastic young impressionist as readily as to a learned and laborious academician.  They are neither for the Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of facts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and naturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely desire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charming artists give their models lunch.  As to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent.  On Monday they will don the rags of a beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper, whose pathetic pictures of modern life draw such tears from the public, and on Tuesday they will pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus, who thinks that all really artistic subjects are necessarily B.C.  They career gaily through all centuries and through all costumes, and, like actors, are interesting only when they are not themselves.  They are extremely good-natured, and very accommodating.  ?What do you sit for?? said a young artist to a model who had sent him in her card (all models, by the way, have cards and a small black bag).  ?Oh, for anything you like, sir,? said the girl, ?landscape if necessary!?  Intellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines, but physically they are perfect?at least some are.  Though none of them can talk Greek, many can look Greek, which to a nineteenth-century painter is naturally of great importance.  If they are allowed, they chatter a great deal, but they never say anything.  Their observations are the only _banalit's_ heard in Bohemia.  However, though they cannot appreciate the artist as artist, they are quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man. They are very sensitive to kindness, respect and generosity.  A beautiful model who had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished English painters, got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices.  On her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present, and received in return a nice letter of thanks with the following remarkable postscript: ?Never eat the green ices!?  When they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest.  Then they sit in a chair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are roused from the tragedy of literature to take their place again in the tragedy of art.  A few of them smoke cigarettes.  This, however, is regarded by the other models as showing a want of seriousness, and is not generally approved of.  They are engaged by the day and by the half-day.  The tariff is a shilling an hour, to which great artists usually add an omnibus fare.  The two best things about them are their extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme respectability.  As a class they are very well behaved, particularly those who sit for the figure, a fact which is curious or natural according to the view one takes of human nature.  They usually marry well, and sometimes they marry the artist.  For an artist to marry his model is as fatal as for a _gourmet_ to marry his cook: the one gets no sittings, and the other gets no dinners.  On the whole the English female models are very na?ve, very natural, and very good-humoured.  The virtues which the artist values most in them are prettiness and punctuality.  Every sensible model consequently keeps a diary of her engagements, and dresses neatly.  The bad season is, of course, the summer, when the artists are out of town.  However, of late years some artists have engaged their models to follow them, and the wife of one of our most charming painters has often had three or four models under her charge in the country, so that the work of her husband and his friends should not be interrupted.  In France the models migrate _en masse_ to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the painters congregate.  The English models, however, wait patiently in London, as a rule, till the artists come back.  Nearly all of them live with their parents, and help to support the house.  They have every qualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful hands.  The hands of the English model are nearly always coarse and red.  As for the male models, there is the veteran whom we have mentioned above.  He has all the traditions of the grand style, and is rapidly disappearing with the school he represents.  An old man who talks about Fuseli is, of course, unendurable, and, besides, patriarchs have ceased to be fashionable |2
48|subjects.  Then there is the true Academy model.  He is usually a man of thirty, rarely good-looking, but a perfect miracle of muscles.  In fact he is the apotheosis of anatomy, and is so conscious of his own splendour that he tells you of his tibia and his thorax, as if no one else had anything of the kind.  Then come the Oriental models.  The supply of these is limited, but there are always about a dozen in London. They are very much sought after as they can remain immobile for hours, and generally possess lovely costumes.  However, they have a very poor opinion of English art, which they regard as something between a vulgar personality and a commonplace photograph.  Next we have the Italian youth who has come over specially to be a model, or takes to it when his organ is out of repair.  He is often quite charming with his large melancholy eyes, his crisp hair, and his slim brown figure.  It is true he eats garlic, but then he can stand like a faun and couch like a leopard, so he is forgiven.  He is always full of pretty compliments, and has been known to have kind words of encouragement for even our greatest artists.  As for the English lad of the same age, he never sits at all.  Apparently he does not regard the career of a model as a serious profession.  In any case he is rarely, if ever, to be got hold of.  English boys, too, are difficult to find.  Sometimes an ex-model who has a son will curl his hair, and wash his face, and bring him the round of the studios, all soap and shininess.  The young school don?t like him, but the older school do, and when he appears on the walls of the Royal Academy he is called _The Infant Samuel_.  Occasionally also an artist catches a couple of _gamins_ in the gutter and asks them to come to his studio.  The first time they always appear, but after that they don?t keep their appointments.  They dislike sitting still, and have a strong and perhaps natural objection to looking pathetic.  Besides, they are always under the impression that the artist is laughing at them.  It is a sad fact, but there is no doubt that the poor are completely unconscious of their own picturesqueness.  Those of them who can be induced to sit do so with the idea that the artist is merely a benevolent philanthropist who has chosen an eccentric method of distributing alms to the undeserving.  Perhaps the School Board will teach the London _gamin_ his own artistic value, and then they will be better models than they are now.  One remarkable privilege belongs to the Academy model, that of extorting a sovereign from any newly elected Associate or R.A.  They wait at Burlington House till the announcement is made, and then race to the hapless artist's house.  The one who arrives first receives the money.  They have of late been much troubled at the long distances they have had to run, and they look with disfavour on the election of artists who live at Hampstead or at Bedford Park, for it is considered a point of honour not to employ the underground railway, omnibuses, or any artificial means of locomotion.  The race is to the swift.  Besides the professional posers of the studio there are posers of the Row, the posers at afternoon teas, the posers in politics and the circus posers.  All four classes are delightful, but only the last class is ever really decorative.  Acrobats and gymnasts can give the young painter infinite suggestions, for they bring into their art an element of swiftness of motion and of constant change that the studio model necessarily lacks.  What is interesting in these 'slaves of the ring? is that with them Beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious aim, the result in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves and distances, of absolute precision of eye, of the scientific knowledge of the equilibrium of forces, and of perfect physical training.  A good acrobat is always graceful, though grace is never his object; he is graceful because he does what he has to do in the best way in which it can be done?graceful because he is natural.  If an ancient Greek were to come to life now, which considering the probable severity of his criticisms would be rather trying to our conceit, he would be found far oftener at the circus than at the theatre.  A good circus is an oasis of Hellenism in a world that reads too much to be wise, and thinks too much to be beautiful.  If it were not for the running-ground at Eton, the towing-path at Oxford, the Thames swimming-baths, and the yearly circuses, humanity would forget the plastic perfection of its own form, and degenerate into a race of short-sighted professors and spectacled _pr?cieuses_.  Not that the circus proprietors are, as a rule, conscious of their high mission.  Do they not bore us with the _haute ?cole_, and weary us with Shakespearean clowns?  Still, at least, they give us acrobats, and the acrobat is an artist.  The mere fact that he never speaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please.  The clown may be blatant, but the acrobat is always beautiful.  He is an interesting combination of the spirit of Greek sculpture with the spangles of the modern costumier.  He has even had his niche in the novels of our age, and if _Manette Salomon_ be the unmasking of the model, _Les Fr?res Zemganno_ is the apotheosis of the acrobat.  As regards the influence of the ordinary model on our English school of painting, it cannot be said that it is altogether good.  It is, of course, an advantage for the young artist sitting in his studio to be able to isolate ?a little corner of life,? as the French say, from disturbing surroundings, and to study it under certain effects of light and shade.  But this very isolation leads often to mere mannerism in the painter, and robs him of that broad acceptance of the general facts of life which is the very essence of art.  Model-painting, in a word, while it may be the condition of art, is not by any means its aim.  It is simply practice, not perfection.  Its use trains the eye and the hand of the painter, its abuse produces in his work an effect of mere posing and prettiness.  It is the secret of much of the artificiality of modern art, this constant posing of pretty people, and when art becomes artificial it becomes monotonous.  Outside the little world of the studio, with its draperies and its _bric-?-brac_, lies the world of life with its infinite, its Shakespearean variety.  We must, however, distinguish between the two kinds of models, those who sit for the figure and those who sit for the costume.  The study of the first is always excellent, but the costume-model is becoming rather wearisome in modern pictures.  It is really of very little use to dress up a London girl in Greek draperies and to paint her as a goddess.  The robe may be the robe of Athens, but the face is usually the face of Brompton.  Now and then, it is true, one comes across a model whose face is an exquisite anachronism, and who looks lovely and natural in the dress of any century but her own.  This, however, is rather rare.  As a rule models are absolutely _de notre si?cle_, and should be painted as such. Unfortunately they are not, and, as a consequence, we are shown every year a series of scenes from fancy dress balls which are called historical pictures, but are little more than mediocre representations of modern people masquerading.  In France they are wiser.  The French painter uses the model simply for study; for the finished picture he goes direct to life.  However, we must not blame the sitters for the shortcomings of the artists.  The English models are a well-behaved and hard-working class, and if they are more interested in artists than in art, a large section of the public is in the same condition, and most of our modern exhibitions seem to justify its choice.     POEMS IN PROSE   _Fortnight Review_, July 1894.    THE ARTIST   ONE evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of _The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.  And he went forth into the world to look for bronze.  For he could think only in bronze.  But all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor anywhere in the whole world was there any bronze to be found, save only the bronze of the image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_.  Now this image he had himself, and with his own hands, fashioned, and had set it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life.  On the tomb of the dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own fashioning, that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth not, and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever.  And in the whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image.  And he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a great furnace, and gave it to the fire.  And out of the bronze of the image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_ he fashioned an image of _The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.    THE DOER OF GOOD   It was night-time and He was alone.  And He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards the city.  And when He came near He heard within the city the tread of the feet of joy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many lutes.  And He knocked at the gate and certain of the gate-keepers opened to Him.  And He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble before it.  The pillars were hung with garlands, and within and without there were torches of cedar.  And He entered the house.  And when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of jasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw lying on a couch of sea-purple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were red with wine.  And He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him, ?Why do you live like this??  And the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made answer and said, ?But I was a leper once, and you healed me.  How else should I live??  And He passed out of the house and went again into the street.  And after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment were painted and whose feet were shod with pearls.  And behind her came, slowly as a hunter, a young man who wore a cloak of two colours.  Now the face of the woman was as the fair face of an idol, and the eyes of the young man were bright with lust.  And He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to him, ?Why do you look at this woman and in such wise??  And the young man turned round and recognised Him and said, ?But I was blind once, and you gave me sight.  At what else should I look??  And He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said to her, ?Is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin??  And the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and said, ?But you forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant way.?  And He passed out of the city.  And when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the roadside a young man who was weeping.  And He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said to him, ?Why are you weeping??  And the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer, ?But I was dead once, and you raised me from the dead.  What else should I do but weep??    THE DISCIPLE   When Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weeping through the woodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort.  And when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters into a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses of their hair and cried to the pool and said, ?We do not wonder that you should mourn in this manner for Narcissus, so beautiful was he.?  ?But was Narcissus beautiful?? said the pool.  ?Who should know that better than you?? answered the Oreads.  ?Us did he ever pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on your banks and look down at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own beauty.?  And the pool answered, ?But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay on my banks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own beauty mirrored.?    THE MASTER   Now when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea, having lighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill into the valley. For he had business in his own home.  And kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw a young man who was naked and weeping.  His hair was the colour of honey, and his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his body with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.  And he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and weeping, ?I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great, for surely He was a just man.?  And the young man answered, ?It is not for Him that I am weeping, but for myself.  I too have changed water into wine, and I have healed the leper and given sight to the blind.  I have walked upon the waters, and from the dwellers in the tombs I have cast out devils.  I have fed the hungry in the desert where there was no food, and I have raised the dead from their narrow houses, and at my bidding, and before a great multitude, of people, a barren fig-tree withered away.  All things that this man has done I have done also.  And yet they have not crucified me.?    THE HOUSE OF JUDGMENT   And there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man came naked before God.  And God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.  And God said to the Man, ?Thy life hath been evil, and thou hast shown cruelty to those who were in need of succour, and to those who lacked help thou hast been bitter and hard of heart.  The poor called to thee and thou didst not hearken, and thine ears were closed to the cry of My afflicted.  The inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto thyself, and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy neighbour's field.  Thou didst take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived in the marshes, and were at peace and praised Me, thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on Mine earth out of which I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.?  And the Man made answer and said, ?Even so did I.?  And again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.  And God said to the Man, ?Thy life hath been evil, and the Beauty I have shown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden thou didst pass by.  The walls of thy chamber were painted with images, and from the bed of thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes.  Thou didst build seven altars to the sins I have suffered, and didst eat of the thing that may not be eaten, and the purple of thy raiment was broidered with the three signs of shame.  Thine idols were neither of gold nor of silver that endure, but of flesh that dieth.  Thou didst stain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands.  Thou didst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them.  With antimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear with myrrh.  Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the thrones of thine idols were set in the sun.  Thou didst show to the sun thy shame and to the moon thy madness.?  And the Man made answer and said, ?Even so did I.?  And a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.  And God said to the Man, ?Evil hath been thy life, and with evil didst thou requite good, and with wrongdoing kindness.  The hands that fed thee thou didst wound, and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise. He who came to thee with water went away thirsting, and the outlawed men who hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn. Thine enemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush, and the friend who walked with thee thou didst sell for a price, and to those who brought thee Love thou didst ever give Lust in thy turn.?  And the Man made answer and said, ?Even so did I.?  And God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said, ?Surely I will send thee into Hell.  Even into Hell will I send thee.?  And the Man cried out, ?Thou canst not.?  And God said to the Man, ?Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell, and for what reason??  ?Because in Hell have I always lived,? answered the Man.  And there was silence in the House of Judgment.  And after a space God spake, and said to the Man, ?Seeing that I may not send thee into Hell, surely I will send thee unto Heaven.  Even unto Heaven will I send thee.?  And the Man cried out, ?Thou canst not.?  And God said to the Man, ?Wherefore can I not send thee unto Heaven, and for what reason??  ?Because never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it,? answered the Man.  And there was silence in the House of Judgment.    THE TEACHER OF WISDOM   From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge of God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers.  And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he kissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he might speak to the world about God.  For there were at that time many in the world who either knew not God at all, or had but an incomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care of their worshippers.  And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without sandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt clay.  And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from the perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto God without ceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were many cities.  And he passed through eleven cities.  And some of these cities were in valleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and others were set on hills.  And in each city he found a disciple who loved him and followed him, and a great multitude also of people followed him from each city, and the knowledge of God spread in the whole land, and many of the rulers were converted, and the priests of the temples in which there were idols found that half of their gain was gone, and when they beat upon their drums at noon none, or but a few, came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming.  Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of his disciples, the greater became his sorrow.  And he knew not why his sorrow was so great.  For he spake ever about God, and out of the fulness of that perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself given to him.  And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a city of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round him, and the multitude knelt in the valley.  And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul, ?Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my disciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday??  And his Soul answered him and said, ?God filled thee with the perfect knowledge of Himself, and thou hast given this knowledge away to others.  The pearl of great price thou hast divided, and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder.  He who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.  He is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber.  Is not God wiser than thou art?  Who art thou to give away the secret that God hath told thee?  I was rich once, and thou hast made me poor.  Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.?  And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him, and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and that he was as one clinging to the skirts of God, and that his faith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believed in him.  And he said to himself, ?I will talk no more about God.  He who giveth away wisdom robbeth himself.?  And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed themselves to the ground and said, ?Master, talk to us about God, for thou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save thee hath this knowledge.?  And he answered them and said, ?I will talk to you about all other things that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not talk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you about God.?  And they were wroth with him and said to him, ?Thou hast led us into the desert that we might hearken to thee.  Wilt thou send us away hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee??  And he answered them and said, ?I will not talk to you about God.?  And the multitude murmured against him and said to him, ?Thou hast led us into the desert, and hast given us no food to eat.  Talk to us about God and it will suffice us.?  But he answered them not a word.  For he knew that if he spake to them about God he would give away his treasure.  And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people returned to their own homes.  And many died on the way.  And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and journeyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any answer.  And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the desert of the Great River.  And having found a cavern in which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for his place of dwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie, and became a hermit.  And every hour the Hermit praised God that He had suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him and of His wonderful greatness.  Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in which he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of evil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands.  Every evening with empty hands the young man passed by, and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple and pearls.  For he was a Robber and robbed the caravans of the merchants.  And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him.  But he spake not a word. For he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.  And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of purple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand, and said to the Hermit: ?Why do you look at me ever in this manner as I pass by?  What is it that I see in your eyes?  For no man has looked at me before in this manner.  And the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me.?  And the Hermit answered him and said, ?What you see in my eyes is pity. Pity is what looks out at you from my eyes.?  And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a bitter voice, and said to him, ?I have purple and pearls in my hands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie.  What pity should you have for me?  And for what reason have you this pity??  ?I have pity for you,? said the Hermit, ?because you have no knowledge of God.?  ?Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?? asked the young man, and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.  ?It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world,? answered the Hermit.  ?And have you got it?? said the young Robber, and he came closer still.  ?Once, indeed,? answered the Hermit, ?I possessed the perfect knowledge of God.  But in my foolishness I parted with it, and divided it amongst others.  Yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious than purple or pearls.?  And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and the pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp sword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, ?Give me, forthwith this knowledge of God that you possess, or I will surely slay you.  Wherefore should I not slay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure??  And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, ?Were it not better for me to go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than to live in the world and have no knowledge of Him?  Slay me if that be your desire. But I will not give away my knowledge of God.?  And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit would not talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the young Robber rose up and said to the Hermit, ?Be it as you will.  As for myself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but three days? journey from this place, and for my purple they will give me pleasure, and for my pearls they will sell me joy.?  And he took up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.  And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him.  For the space of three days he followed the young Robber on the road and entreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the Seven Sins.  And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and called to him, and said, ?Will you give me this knowledge of God which is more precious than purple and pearls?  If you will give me that, I will not enter the city.?  And ever did the Hermit answer, ?All things that I have I will give thee, save that one thing only.  For that thing it is not lawful for me to give away.?  And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins.  And from the city there came the sound of much laughter.  And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the gate. And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: ?Stretch forth your hands, and set your arms around my neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the knowledge of God.?  And the young Robber stopped.  And when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell upon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.  And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing beside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like fine wool.  And He raised the Hermit up, and said to him: ?Before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.  Now thou shalt have the perfect love of God.  Wherefore art thou weeping??  And he kissed him.

HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy Prince.  He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was very much admired indeed.  ?He is as beautiful as a weathercock,? remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; ?only not quite so useful,? he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.  ?Why can?t you be like the Happy Prince?? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.  ?The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.?  ?I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,? muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.  ?He looks just like an angel,? said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores.  ?How do you know?? said the Mathematical Master, ?you have never seen one.?  ?Ah! but we have, in our dreams,? answered the children; and the Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  ?Shall I love you?? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.  ?It is a ridiculous attachment,? twittered the other Swallows; 'she has no money, and far too many relations?; and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.  After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. ?She has no conversation,? he said, ?and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.?  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  ?I admit that she is domestic,? he continued, ?but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.?  ?Will you come away with me?? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her head, she was so attached to her home.  ?You have been trifling with me,? he cried.  ?I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!? and he flew away.  All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.  ?Where shall I put up?? he said; ?I hope the town has made preparations.?  Then he saw the statue on the tall column.  ?I will put up there,? he cried; ?it is a fine position, with plenty of fresh air.?  So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  ?I have a golden bedroom,? he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  ?What a curious thing!? he cried; ?there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.?  Then another drop fell.  ?What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?? he said; ?I must look for a good chimney-pot,? and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw?Ah! what did he see?  The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.  His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.  ?Who are you?? he said.  ?I am the Happy Prince.?  ?Why are you weeping then?? asked the Swallow; ?you have quite drenched me.?  ?When I was alive and had a human heart,? answered the statue, ?I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.?  ?What! is he not solid gold?? said the Swallow to himself.  He was too polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  ?Far away,? continued the statue in a low musical voice, ?far away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt?  My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move.?  ?I am waited for in Egypt,? said the Swallow.  ?My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.  The King is there himself in his painted coffin.  He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices.  Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.?  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?will you not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger?  The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so sad.?  ?I don?t think I like boys,? answered the Swallow.  ?Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me.  They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.?  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry. ?It is very cold here,? he said; ?but I will stay with you for one night, and be your messenger.?  ?Thank you, little Swallow,? said the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince's sword, and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured.  He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing.  A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.  ?How wonderful the stars are,? he said to her, ?and how wonderful is the power of love!?  ?I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball,? she answered; ?I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.?  He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he came to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy's forehead with his wings.  ?How cool I feel,? said the boy, ?I must be getting better?; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done.  ?It is curious,? he remarked, ?but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.?  ?That is because you have done a good action,? said the Prince.  And the little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep.  Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  ?What a remarkable phenomenon,? said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.  ?A swallow in winter!?  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.  ?To-night I go to Egypt,? said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, ?What a distinguished stranger!? so he enjoyed himself very much.  When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  ?Have you any commissions for Egypt?? he cried; ?I am just starting.?  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?will you not stay with me one night longer??  ?I am waited for in Egypt,? answered the Swallow.  ?To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water's edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.?  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?far away across the city I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.?  ?I will wait with you one night longer,? said the Swallow, who really had a good heart.  ?Shall I take him another ruby??  ?Alas!  I have no ruby now,? said the Prince; ?my eyes are all that I have left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.  Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.?  ?Dear Prince,? said the Swallow, ?I cannot do that?; and he began to weep.  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?do as I command you.?  So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.  ?I am beginning to be appreciated,? he cried; ?this is from some great admirer.  Now I can finish my play,? and he looked quite happy.  The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  ?Heave a-hoy!? they shouted as each chest came up.  ?I am going to Egypt?! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  ?I am come to bid you good-bye,? he cried.  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?will you not stay with me one night longer??  ?It is winter,? answered the Swallow, ?and the chill snow will soon be here.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.?  ?In the square below,? said the Happy Prince, ?there stands a little match-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.  Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying.  She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare.  Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will not beat her.?  ?I will stay with you one night longer,? said the Swallow, ?but I cannot pluck out your eye.  You would be quite blind then.?  ?Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?do as I command you.?  So he plucked out the Prince's other eye, and darted down with it.  He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her hand.  ?What a lovely bit of glass,? cried the little girl; and she ran home, laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.  ?You are blind now,? he said, 'so I will stay with you always.?  ?No, little Swallow,? said the poor Prince, ?you must go away to Egypt.?  ?I will stay with you always,? said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.  All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.  ?Dear little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.?  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm.  ?How hungry we are!? they said.  ?You must not lie here,? shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.  ?I am covered with fine gold,? said the Prince, ?you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that gold can make them happy.?  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the children's faces grew rosier, and they laughed and played games in the street.  ?We have bread now!? they cried.  Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.  The streets looked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he loved him too well.  He picked up crumbs outside the baker's door when the baker was not looking and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at last he knew that he was going to die.  He had just strength to fly up to the Prince's shoulder once more.  ?Good-bye, dear Prince!? he murmured, ?will you let me kiss your hand??  ?I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,? said the Prince, ?you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the lips, for I love you.?  ?It is not to Egypt that I am going,? said the Swallow.  ?I am going to the House of Death.  Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not??  And he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.  The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.  Early the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors.  As they passed the column he looked up at the statue: ?Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!? he said.  ?How shabby indeed!? cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed with the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.  ?The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer,? said the Mayor in fact, ?he is litttle better than a beggar!?  ?Little better than a beggar,? said the Town Councillors.  ?And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!? continued the Mayor.  ?We must really issue a proclamation that birds are not to be allowed to die here.?  And the Town Clerk made a note of the suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince.  ?As he is no longer beautiful he is no longer useful,? said the Art Professor at the University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.  ?We must have another statue, of course,? he said, ?and it shall be a statue of myself.?  ?Of myself,? said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled. When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  ?What a strange thing!? said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. ?This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace.  We must throw it away.?  So they threw it on a dust-heap where the dead Swallow was also lying.  ?Bring me the two most precious things in the city,? said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.  ?You have rightly chosen,? said God, ?for in my garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.?                       The Nightingale and the Rose.             ?SHE said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,? cried the young Student; ?but in all my garden there is no red rose.?  From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard him, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.  ?No red rose in all my garden!? he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.  ?Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!  I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.?  ?Here at last is a true lover,? said the Nightingale.  ?Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him.  His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.?  ?The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,? murmured the young Student, ?and my love will be of the company.  If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn.  If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine.  But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.  She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.?  ?Here indeed is the true lover,? said the Nightingale.  ?What I sing of, he suffers?what is joy to me, to him is pain.  Surely Love is a wonderful thing.  It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.  It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.?  ?The musicians will sit in their gallery,? said the young Student, ?and play upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to the sound of the harp and the violin.  She will dance so lightly that her feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay dresses will throng round her.  But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her?; and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.  ?Why is he weeping?? asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past him with his tail in the air.  ?Why, indeed?? said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a sunbeam.  ?Why, indeed?? whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low voice.  ?He is weeping for a red rose,? said the Nightingale.  ?For a red rose?? they cried; ?how very ridiculous!? and the little Lizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.  But the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow, and she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of Love.  Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed across the garden.  In the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree, and when she saw it she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.  ?Give me a red rose,? she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?  But the Tree shook its head.  ?My roses are white,? it answered; ?as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.  But go to my brother who grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you what you want.?  So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing round the old sun-dial.  ?Give me a red rose,? she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?  But the Tree shook its head.  ?My roses are yellow,? it answered; ?as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.  But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's window, and perhaps he will give you what you want.?  So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing beneath the Student's window.  ?Give me a red rose,? she cried, ?and I will sing you my sweetest song.?  But the Tree shook its head.  ?My roses are red,? it answered, ?as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.  But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.?  ?One red rose is all I want,? cried the Nightingale, ?only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it??  ?There is a way,? answered the Tree; ?but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you.?  ?Tell it to me,? said the Nightingale, ?I am not afraid.?  ?If you want a red rose,? said the Tree, ?you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart's-blood.  You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.  All night long you must sing to me, and the thorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into my veins, and become mine.?  ?Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,? cried the Nightingale, ?and Life is very dear to all.  It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.  Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.  Yet Love is better than Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a man??  So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air.  She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a shadow she sailed through the grove.  The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.  ?Be happy,? cried the Nightingale, ?be happy; you shall have your red rose.  I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with my own heart's-blood.  All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.  Flame-coloured are his wings, and coloured like flame is his body.  His lips are sweet as honey, and his breath is like frankincense.?  The Student looked up from the grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the Nightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that are written down in books.  But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.  ?Sing me one last song,? he whispered; ?I shall feel very lonely when you are gone.?  So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.  When she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a note-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.  ?She has form,? he said to himself, as he walked away through the grove??that cannot be denied to her; but has she got feeling?  I am afraid not.  In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without any sincerity.  She would not sacrifice herself for others.  She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.  Still, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her voice.  What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any practical good.? And he went into his room, and lay down on his little pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he fell asleep.  And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.  All night long she sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold crystal Moon leaned down and listened.  All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.  She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl. And on the top-most spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a marvellous rose, petal following petal, as song followed song.  Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river?pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.  As the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a water-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of the Tree.  But the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. ?Press closer, little Nightingale,? cried the Tree, ?or the Day will come before the rose is finished.?  So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for she sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.  And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's heart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can crimson the heart of a rose.  And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn. ?Press closer, little Nightingale,? cried the Tree, ?or the Day will come before the rose is finished.?  So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang|2
50| of pain shot through her.  Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.  And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky. Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.  But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.  Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.  Then she gave one last burst of music.  The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky.  The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.  Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams.  It floated through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message to the sea.  ?Look, look!? cried the Tree, ?the rose is finished now?; but the Nightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long grass, with the thorn in her heart.  And at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.  ?Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!? he cried; ?here is a red rose!  I have never seen any rose like it in all my life.  It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name?; and he leaned down and plucked it.  Then he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with the rose in his hand.  The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.  ?You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,? cried the Student.  ?Here is the reddest rose in all the world.  You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.?  But the girl frowned.  ?I am afraid it will not go with my dress,? she answered; ?and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.?  ?Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,? said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.  ?Ungrateful!? said the girl.  ?I tell you what, you are very rude; and, after all, who are you?  Only a Student.  Why, I don?t believe you have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the Chamberlain's nephew has?; and she got up from her chair and went into the house.  ?What a silly thing Love is,? said the Student as he walked away.  ?It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and it is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and making one believe things that are not true.  In fact, it is quite unpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall go back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.?  So he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and began to read.                 The Selfish Giant.                            EVERY afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden.  It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass.  Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit.  The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.  ?How happy we are here!? they cried to each other.               One day the Giant came back.  He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.  After the seven years were over he had said all that he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to his own castle.  When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.  ?What are you doing here?? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.  ?My own garden is my own garden,? said the Giant; ?any one can understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself.?  So he built a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.            TRESPASSERS              WILL BE             PROSECUTED  He was a very selfish Giant.  The poor children had now nowhere to play.  They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.  They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.  ?How happy we were there,? they said to each other.  Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds.  Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter.  The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.  Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.  The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. ?Spring has forgotten this garden,? they cried, 'so we will live here all the year round.?  The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver.  Then they invited the North Wind to stay with them, and he came.  He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down. ?This is a delightful spot,? he said, ?we must ask the Hail on a visit.? So the Hail came.  Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go.  He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.  ?I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,? said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; ?I hope there will be a change in the weather.?  But the Spring never came, nor the Summer.  The Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave none.  ?He is too selfish,? she said.  So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.  One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.  It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.  It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.  Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.  ?I believe the Spring has come at last,? said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.  What did he see?  He saw a most wonderful sight.  Through a little hole in the wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the trees.  In every tree that he could see there was a little child.  And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads.  The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing.  It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.  He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.  The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.  ?Climb up! little boy,? said the Tree, and it bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.  And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.  ?How selfish I have been!? he said; ?now I know why the Spring would not come here.  I will put that poor little boy on the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be the children's playground for ever and ever.?  He was really very sorry for what he had done.  So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite softly, and went out into the garden.  But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.  And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.  And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.  And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.  ?It is your garden now, little children,? said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.  And when the people were going to market at twelve o?clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.  All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.  ?But where is your little companion?? he said: ?the boy I put into the tree.?  The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.  ?We don?t know,? answered the children; ?he has gone away.?  ?You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,? said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.  Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.  But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him.  ?How I would like to see him!? he used to say.  Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble.  He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.  ?I have many beautiful flowers,? he said; ?but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.?  One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing.  He did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep, and that the flowers were resting.  Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and looked and looked.  It certainly was a marvellous sight.  In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.  Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.  Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden.  He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child.  And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, ?Who hath dared to wound thee??  For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.  ?Who hath dared to wound thee?? cried the Giant; ?tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.?  ?Nay!? answered the child; ?but these are the wounds of Love.?  ?Who art thou?? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.  And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, ?You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise.?  And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.                        The Devoted Friend.                           ONE morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole.  He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.  The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.  ?You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads,? she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done.  But the little ducks paid no attention to her.  They were so young that they did not know what an advantage it is to be in society at all.  ?What disobedient children!? cried the old Water-rat; ?they really deserve to be drowned.?  ?Nothing of the kind,? answered the Duck, ?every one must make a beginning, and parents cannot be too patient.?  ?Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents,? said the Water-rat; ?I am not a family man.  In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.  Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.  Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship.?  ?And what, pray, is your idea of the duties of a devoted friend?? asked a Green Linnet, who was sitting in a willow-tree hard by, and had overheard the conversation.  ?Yes, that is just what I want to know,? said the Duck; and she swam away to the end of the pond, and stood upon her head, in order to give her children a good example.  ?What a silly question!? cried the Water-rat.  ?I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.?  ?And what would you do in return?? said the little bird, swinging upon a silver spray, and flapping his tiny wings.  ?I don?t understand you,? answered the Water-rat.  ?Let me tell you a story on the subject,? said the Linnet.  ?Is the story about me?? asked the Water-rat.  ?If so, I will listen to it, for I am extremely fond of fiction.?  ?It is applicable to you,? answered the Linnet; and he flew down, and alighting upon the bank, he told the story of The Devoted Friend.  ?Once upon a time,? said the Linnet, ?there was an honest little fellow named Hans.?  ?Was he very distinguished?? asked the Water-rat.  ?No,? answered the Linnet, ?I don?t think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.  He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden.  In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his. Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds?-purses, and Fair-maids of France.  There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white.  Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.  ?Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.  Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that he would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.  ??Real friends should have everything in common,? the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.  ?Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milch cows, and a large flock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.  ?So little Hans worked away in his garden.  During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.  In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.  ??There is no good in my going to see little Hans as long as the snow lasts,? the Miller used to say to his wife, ?for when people are in trouble they should be left alone, and not be bothered by visitors.  That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right.  So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses and that will make him so happy.?  ??You are certainly very thoughtful about others,? answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; ?very thoughtful indeed.  It is quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.  I am sure the clergyman himself could not say such beautiful things as you do, though he does live in a three-storied house, and wear a gold ring on his little finger.?  ??But could we not ask little Hans up here?? said the Miller's youngest son.  ?If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.?  ??What a silly boy you are!? cried the Miller; ?I really don?t know what is the use of sending you to school.  You seem not to learn anything. Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.  I certainly will not allow Hans? nature to be spoiled.  I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.  Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do.  Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused.  Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things.  Everybody can see that.?  ??How well you talk!? said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale; ?really I feel quite drowsy.  It is just like being in church.?  ??Lots of people act well,? answered the Miller; ?but very few people talk well, which shows that talking is much the more difficult thing of the two, and much the finer thing also?; and he looked sternly across the table at his little son, who felt so ashamed of himself that he hung his head down, and grew quite scarlet, and began to cry into his tea. However, he was so young that you must excuse him.?  ?Is that the end of the story?? asked the Water-rat.  ?Certainly not,? answered the Linnet, ?that is the beginning.?  ?Then you are quite behind the age,? said the Water-rat.  ?Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle.  That is the new method.  I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man.  He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ?Pooh!? But pray go on with your story.  I like the Miller immensely.  I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.?  ?Well,? said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, ?as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans.  ??Why, what a good heart you have!? cried his Wife; ?you are always thinking of others.  And mind you take the big basket with you for the flowers.?  ?So the Miller tied the sails of the windmill together with a strong iron chain, and went down the hill with the basket on his arm.  ??Good morning, little Hans,? said the Miller.  ??Good morning,? said Hans, leaning on his spade, and smiling from ear to ear.  ??And how have you been all the winter?? said the Miller.  ??Well, really,? cried Hans, ?it is very good of you to ask, very good indeed.  I am afraid I had rather a hard time of it, but now the spring has come, and I am quite happy, and all my flowers are doing well.?  ??We often talked of you during the winter, Hans,? said the Miller, ?and wondered how you were getting on.?  ??That was kind of you,? said Hans; ?I was half afraid you had forgotten me.?  ??Hans, I am surprised at you,? said the Miller; ?friendship never forgets.  That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don?t understand the poetry of life.  How lovely your primroses are looking, by-the-bye!?  ??They are certainly very lovely,? said Hans, ?and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.  I am going to bring them into the market and sell them to the Burgomaster's daughter, and buy back my wheelbarrow with the money.?  ??Buy back your wheelbarrow?  You don?t mean to say you have sold it? What a very stupid thing to do!?  ??Well, the fact is,? said Hans, ?that I was obliged to.  You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.  So I first sold the silver buttons off my Sunday coat, and then I sold my silver chain, and then I sold my big pipe, and at last I sold my wheelbarrow.  But I am going to buy them all back again now.?  ??Hans,? said the Miller, ?I will give you my wheelbarrow.  It is not in very good repair; indeed, one side is gone, and there is something wrong with the wheel-spokes; but in spite of that I will give it to you.  I know it is very generous of me, and a great many people would think me extremely foolish for parting with it, but I am not like the rest of the world.  I think that generosity is the essence of friendship, and, besides, I have got a new wheelbarrow for myself.  Yes, you may set your mind at ease, I will give you my wheelbarrow.?  ??Well, really, that is generous of you,? said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.  ?I can easily put it in repair, as I have a plank of wood in the house.?  ??A plank of wood!? said the Miller; ?why, that is just what I want for the roof of my barn.  There is a very large hole in it, and the corn will all get damp if I don?t stop it up.  How lucky you mentioned it!  It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.  I have given you my wheelbarrow, and now you are going to give me your plank.  Of course, the wheelbarrow is worth far more than the plank, but true, friendship never notices things like that.  Pray get it at once, and I will set to work at my barn this very day.?  ??Certainly,? cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.  ??It is not a very big plank,? said the Miller, looking at it, ?and I am afraid that after I have mended my barn-roof there won?t be any left for you to mend the wheelbarrow with; but, of course, that is not my fault. And now, as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I am sure you would like to give me some flowers in return.  Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.?  ??Quite full?? said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.  ??Well, really,? answered the Miller, ?as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don?t think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers. I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.?  ??My dear friend, my best friend,? cried little Hans, ?you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.  I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day?; and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.  ??Good-bye, little Hans,? said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.  ??Good-bye,? said little Hans, and he began to dig away quite merrily, he was so pleased about the wheelbarrow.  ?The next day he was nailing up some honeysuckle against the porch, when he heard the Miller's voice calling to him from the road.  So he jumped off the ladder, and ran down the garden, and looked over the wall.  ?There was the Miller with a large sack of flour on his back.  ??Dear little Hans,? said the Miller, ?would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market??  ??Oh, I am so sorry,? said Hans, ?but I am really very busy to-day.  I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.?  ??Well, really,? said the Miller, ?I think that, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, it is rather unfriendly of you to refuse.?  ??Oh, don?t say that,? cried little Hans, ?I wouldn?t be unfriendly for the whole world?; and he ran in for his cap, and trudged off with the big sack on his shoulders.  ?It was a very hot day, and the road was terribly dusty, and before Hans had reached the sixth milestone he was so tired that he had to sit down and rest.  However, he went on bravely, and as last he reached the market.  After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.  ??It has certainly been a hard day,? said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, ?but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.?  ?Early the next morning the Miller came down to get the money for his sack of flour, but little Hans was so tired that he was still in bed.  ??Upon my word,? said the Miller, ?you are very lazy.  Really, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, I think you might work harder.  Idleness is a great sin, and I certainly don?t like any of my friends to be idle or sluggish.  You must not mind my speaking quite plainly to you.  Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.  But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means?  Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.  Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.?  ??I am very sorry,? said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, ?but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.  Do you know that I always work better after hearing the birds sing??  ??Well, I am glad of that,? said the Miller, clapping little Hans on the back, ?for I want you to come up to the mill as soon as you are dressed, and mend my barn-roof for me.?  ?Poor little Hans was very anxious to go and work in his garden, for his flowers had not been watered for two days, but he did not like to refuse the Miller, as he was such a good friend to him.  ??Do you think it would be unfriendly of me if I said I was busy?? he inquired in a shy and timid voice.  ??Well, really,? answered the Miller, ?I do not think it is much to ask of you, considering that I am going to give you my wheelbarrow; but of course if you refuse I will go and do it myself.?  ??Oh! on no account,? cried little Hans and he jumped out of bed, and dressed himself, and went up to the barn.  ?He worked there all day long, till sunset, and at sunset the Miller came to see how he was getting on.  ??Have you mended the hole in the roof yet, little Hans?? cried the Miller in a cheery voice.  ??It is quite mended,? answered little Hans, coming down the ladder.  ??Ah!? said the Miller, ?there is no work so delightful as the work one does for others.?  ??It is certainly a great privilege to hear you talk,? answered little Hans, sitting down, and wiping his forehead, ?a very great privilege. But I am afraid I shall never have such beautiful ideas as you have.?  ??Oh! they will come to you,? said the Miller, ?but you must take more pains.  At present you have only the practice of friendship; some day you will have the theory also.?  ??Do you really think I shall?? asked little Hans.  ??I have no doubt of it,? answered the Miller, ?but now that you have mended the roof, you had better go home and rest, for I want you to drive my sheep to the mountain to-morrow.?  ?Poor little Hans was afraid to say a|2
51|nything to this, and early the next morning the Miller brought his sheep round to the cottage, and Hans started off with them to the mountain.  It took him the whole day to get there and back; and when he returned he was so tired that he went off to sleep in his chair, and did not wake up till it was broad daylight.  ??What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,? he said, and he went to work at once.  ?But somehow he was never able to look after his flowers at all, for his friend the Miller was always coming round and sending him off on long errands, or getting him to help at the mill.  Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.  ?Besides,? he used to say, ?he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that is an act of pure generosity.?  ?So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.  ?Now it happened that one evening little Hans was sitting by his fireside when a loud rap came at the door.  It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.  But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.  ??It is some poor traveller,? said little Hans to himself, and he ran to the door.  ?There stood the Miller with a lantern in one hand and a big stick in the other.  ??Dear little Hans,? cried the Miller, ?I am in great trouble.  My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.  But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.  You know I am going to give you my wheelbarrow, and so, it is only fair that you should do something for me in return.?  ??Certainly,? cried little Hans, ?I take it quite as a compliment your coming to me, and I will start off at once.  But you must lend me your lantern, as the night is so dark that I am afraid I might fall into the ditch.?  ??I am very sorry,? answered the Miller, ?but it is my new lantern, and it would be a great loss to me if anything happened to it.?  ??Well, never mind, I will do without it,? cried little Hans, and he took down his great fur coat, and his warm scarlet cap, and tied a muffler round his throat, and started off.  ?What a dreadful storm it was!  The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand.  However, he was very courageous, and after he had been walking about three hours, he arrived at the Doctor's house, and knocked at the door.  ??Who is there?? cried the Doctor, putting his head out of his bedroom window.  ??Little Hans, Doctor.?  ??What do you want, little Hans??  ??The Miller's son has fallen from a ladder, and has hurt himself, and the Miller wants you to come at once.?  ??All right!? said the Doctor; and he ordered his horse, and his big boots, and his lantern, and came downstairs, and rode off in the direction of the Miller's house, little Hans trudging behind him.  ?But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse. At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.  His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.  ?Everybody went to little Hans? funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.  ??As I was his best friend,? said the Miller, ?it is only fair that I should have the best place?; so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief.  ??Little Hans is certainly a great loss to every one,? said the Blacksmith, when the funeral was over, and they were all seated comfortably in the inn, drinking spiced wine and eating sweet cakes.  ??A great loss to me at any rate,? answered the Miller; ?why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don?t know what to do with it.  It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it.  I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.  One always suffers for being generous.??  ?Well?? said the Water-rat, after a long pause.  ?Well, that is the end,? said the Linnet.  ?But what became of the Miller?? asked the Water-rat.  ?Oh!  I really don?t know,? replied the Linnet; ?and I am sure that I don?t care.?  ?It is quite evident then that you have no sympathy in your nature,? said the Water-rat.  ?I am afraid you don?t quite see the moral of the story,? remarked the Linnet.  ?The what?? screamed the Water-rat.  ?The moral.?  ?Do you mean to say that the story has a moral??  ?Certainly,? said the Linnet.  ?Well, really,? said the Water-rat, in a very angry manner, ?I think you should have told me that before you began.  If you had done so, I certainly would not have listened to you; in fact, I should have said ?Pooh,? like the critic.  However, I can say it now?; so he shouted out ?Pooh? at the top of his voice, gave a whisk with his tail, and went back into his hole.  ?And how do you like the Water-rat?? asked the Duck, who came paddling up some minutes afterwards.  ?He has a great many good points, but for my own part I have a mother's feelings, and I can never look at a confirmed bachelor without the tears coming into my eyes.?  ?I am rather afraid that I have annoyed him,? answered the Linnet.  ?The fact is, that I told him a story with a moral.?  ?Ah! that is always a very dangerous thing to do,? said the Duck.  And I quite agree with her.            The Remarkable Rocket.                          THE King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings. He had waited a whole year for his bride, and at last she had arrived. She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.  The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.  Her long ermine-cloak reached right down to her feet, on her head was a tiny cap of silver tissue, and she was as pale as the Snow Palace in which she had always lived.  So pale was she that as she drove through the streets all the people wondered.  ?She is like a white rose!? they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.      At the gate of the Castle the Prince was waiting to receive her.  He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.  When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.  ?Your picture was beautiful,? he murmured, ?but you are more beautiful than your picture?; and the little Princess blushed.  ?She was like a white rose before,? said a young Page to his neighbour, ?but she is like a red rose now?; and the whole Court was delighted.  For the next three days everybody went about saying, ?White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose?; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.  As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.  When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.  It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.  Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.  The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.  Only true lovers could drink out of this cup, for if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.  ?It's quite clear that they love each other,? said the little Page, ?as clear as crystal!? and the King doubled his salary a second time.  ?What an honour!? cried all the courtiers.  After the banquet there was to be a Ball.  The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.  He played very badly, but no one had ever dared to tell him so, because he was the King.  Indeed, he knew only two airs, and was never quite certain which one he was playing; but it made no matter, for, whatever he did, everybody cried out, ?Charming! charming!?  The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.  The little Princess had never seen a firework in her life, so the King had given orders that the Royal Pyrotechnist should be in attendance on the day of her marriage.  ?What are fireworks like?? she had asked the Prince, one morning, as she was walking on the terrace.  ?They are like the Aurora Borealis,? said the King, who always answered questions that were addressed to other people, ?only much more natural. I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.  You must certainly see them.?  So at the end of the King's garden a great stand had been set up, and as soon as the Royal Pyrotechnist had put everything in its proper place, the fireworks began to talk to each other.  ?The world is certainly very beautiful,? cried a little Squib.  ?Just look at those yellow tulips.  Why! if they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.  I am very glad I have travelled.  Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.?  ?The King's garden is not the world, you foolish squib,? said a big Roman Candle; ?the world is an enormous place, and it would take you three days to see it thoroughly.?  ?Any place you love is the world to you,? exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart; ?but love is not fashionable any more, the poets have killed it.  They wrote so much about it that nobody believed them, and I am not surprised.  True love suffers, and is silent.  I remember myself once?But it is no matter now.  Romance is a thing of the past.?  ?Nonsense!? said the Roman Candle, ?Romance never dies.  It is like the moon, and lives for ever.  The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.  I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news.?  But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.  ?Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead,? she murmured.  She was one of those people who think that, if you say the same thing over and over a great many times, it becomes true in the end.  Suddenly, a sharp, dry cough was heard, and they all looked round.  It came from a tall, supercilious-looking Rocket, who was tied to the end of a long stick.  He always coughed before he made any observation, so as to attract attention.  ?Ahem! ahem!? he said, and everybody listened except the poor Catherine Wheel, who was still shaking her head, and murmuring, ?Romance is dead.?  ?Order! order!? cried out a Cracker.  He was something of a politician, and had always taken a prominent part in the local elections, so he knew the proper Parliamentary expressions to use.  ?Quite dead,? whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.  As soon as there was perfect silence, the Rocket coughed a third time and began.  He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.  In fact, he had a most distinguished manner.  ?How fortunate it is for the King's son,? he remarked, ?that he is to be married on the very day on which I am to be let off.  Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.?  ?Dear me!? said the little Squib, ?I thought it was quite the other way, and that we were to be let off in the Prince's honour.?  ?It may be so with you,? he answered; ?indeed, I have no doubt that it is, but with me it is different.  I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.  My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.  When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.  She was three feet and a half in diameter, and made of the very best gunpowder.  My father was a Rocket like myself, and of French extraction.  He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.  He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.  The newspapers wrote about his performance in very flattering terms.  Indeed, the Court Gazette called him a triumph of Pylotechnic art.?  ?Pyrotechnic, Pyrotechnic, you mean,? said a Bengal Light; ?I know it is Pyrotechnic, for I saw it written on my own canister.?  ?Well, I said Pylotechnic,? answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.  ?I was saying,? continued the Rocket, ?I was saying?What was I saying??  ?You were talking about yourself,? replied the Roman Candle.  ?Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.  I hate rudeness and bad manners of every kind, for I am extremely sensitive.  No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.?  ?What is a sensitive person?? said the Cracker to the Roman Candle.  ?A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes,? answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper; and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.  ?Pray, what are you laughing at?? inquired the Rocket; ?I am not laughing.?  ?I am laughing because I am happy,? replied the Cracker.  ?That is a very selfish reason,? said the Rocket angrily.  ?What right have you to be happy?  You should be thinking about others.  In fact, you should be thinking about me.  I am always thinking about myself, and I expect everybody else to do the same.  That is what is called sympathy. It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.  Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!  The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.  Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.?  ?If you want to give pleasure to others,? cried the Roman Candle, ?you had better keep yourself dry.?  ?Certainly,? exclaimed the Bengal Light, who was now in better spirits; ?that is only common sense.?  ?Common sense, indeed!? said the Rocket indignantly; ?you forget that I am very uncommon, and very remarkable.  Why, anybody can have common sense, provided that they have no imagination.  But I have imagination, for I never think of things as they really are; I always think of them as being quite different.  As for keeping myself dry, there is evidently no one here who can at all appreciate an emotional nature.  Fortunately for myself, I don?t care.  The only thing that sustains one through life is the consciousness of the immense inferiority of everybody else, and this is a feeling that I have always cultivated.  But none of you have any hearts.  Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.?  ?Well, really,? exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, ?why not?  It is a most joyful occasion, and when I soar up into the air I intend to tell the stars all about it.  You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.?  ?Ah! what a trivial view of life!? said the Rocket; ?but it is only what I expected.  There is nothing in you; you are hollow and empty.  Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself; and perhaps some day he may go out to walk with his nurse; and perhaps the nurse may go to sleep under a great elder-tree; and perhaps the little boy may fall into the deep river and be drowned.  What a terrible misfortune!  Poor people, to lose their only son!  It is really too dreadful!  I shall never get over it.?  ?But they have not lost their only son,? said the Roman Candle; ?no misfortune has happened to them at all.?  ?I never said that they had,? replied the Rocket; ?I said that they might.  If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.  I hate people who cry over spilt milk. But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.?  ?You certainly are!? cried the Bengal Light.  ?In fact, you are the most affected person I ever met.?  ?You are the rudest person I ever met,? said the Rocket, ?and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince.?  ?Why, you don?t even know him,? growled the Roman Candle.  ?I never said I knew him,? answered the Rocket.  ?I dare say that if I knew him I should not be his friend at all.  It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.?  ?You had really better keep yourself dry,? said the Fire-balloon.  ?That is the important thing.?  ?Very important for you, I have no doubt,? answered the Rocket, ?but I shall weep if I choose?; and he actually burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who were just thinking of setting up house together, and were looking for a nice dry spot to live in.  ?He must have a truly romantic nature,? said the Catherine Wheel, ?for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about?; and she heaved a deep sigh, and thought about the deal box.  But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, ?Humbug! humbug!? at the top of their voices.  They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.  Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield; and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.  The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.  They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.  Then ten o?clock struck, and then eleven, and then twelve, and at the last stroke of midnight every one came out on the terrace, and the King sent for the Royal Pyrotechnist.  ?Let the fireworks begin,? said the King; and the Royal Pyrotechnist made a low bow, and marched down to the end of the garden.  He had six attendants with him, each of whom carried a lighted torch at the end of a long pole.  It was certainly a magnificent display.  Whizz! Whizz! went the Catherine Wheel, as she spun round and round. Boom!  Boom! went the Roman Candle.  Then the Squibs danced all over the place, and the Bengal Lights made everything look scarlet.  ?Good-bye,? cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks. Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.  Every one was a great success except the Remarkable Rocket. He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.  The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.  All his poor relations, to whom he would never speak, except with a sneer, shot up into the sky like wonderful golden flowers with blossoms of fire.  Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court; and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.  ?I suppose they are reserving me for some grand occasion,? said the Rocket; ?no doubt that is what it means,? and he looked more supercilious than ever.  The next day the workmen came to put everything tidy.  ?This is evidently a deputation,? said the Rocket; ?I will receive them with becoming dignity? so he put his nose in the air, and began to frown severely as if he were thinking about some very important subject.  But they took no notice of him at all till they were just going away.  Then one of them caught sight of him.  ?Hallo!? he cried, ?what a bad rocket!? and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.  ?BAD Rocket?  BAD Rocket?? he said, as he whirled through the air; ?impossible!  GRAND Rocket, that is what the man said.  BAD and GRAND sound very much the same, indeed they often are the same?; and he fell into the mud.  ?It is not comfortable here,? he remarked, ?but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.  My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.?  Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him.  ?A new arrival, I see!? said the Frog.  ?Well, after all there is nothing like mud.  Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.  Do you think it will be a wet afternoon?  I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.  What a pity!?  ?Ahem! ahem!? said the Rocket, and he began to cough.  ?What a delightful voice you have!? cried the Frog.  ?Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.  You will hear our glee-club this evening.  We sit in the old duck pond close by the farmer's house, and as soon as the moon rises we begin. It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.  In fact, it was only yesterday that I heard the farmer's wife say to her mother that she could not get a wink of sleep at night on account of us.  It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.?  ?Ahem! ahem!? said the Rocket angrily.  He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.  ?A delightful voice, certainly,? continued the Frog; ?I hope you will come over to the duck-pond.  I am off to look for my daughters.  I have six beautiful daughters, and I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.  He is a perfect monster, and would have no hesitation in breakfasting off them.  Well, good-bye: I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.?  ?Conversation, indeed!? said the Rocket.  ?You have talked the whole time yourself.  That is not conversation.?  ?Somebody must listen,? answered the Frog, ?and I like to do all the talking myself.  It saves time, and prevents arguments.?  ?But I like arguments,? said the Rocket.  ?I hope not,? said the Frog complacently.  ?Arguments are extremely vulgar, for everybody in good society holds exactly the same opinions. Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.  ?You are a very irritating person,? said the Rocket, ?and very ill-bred. I hate people who talk about themselves, as you do, when one wants to talk about oneself, as I do.  It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.  In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model. Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately.  I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.  Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial.?  ?There is no good talking to him,? said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; ?no good at all, for he has gone away.?  ?Well, that is his loss, not mine,? answered the Rocket.  ?I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.  I like hearing myself talk.  It is one of my greatest pleasures.  I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don?t understand a single word of what I am saying.?  ?Then you should certainly lecture on Philosophy,? said the Dragon-fly; and he spread a pair of lovely gauze wings and soared away into the sky.  ?How very silly of him not to stay here!? said the Rocket.  ?I am sure that he has not often got such a chance of improving his mind.  However, I don?t care a bit.  Genius like mine is sure to be appreciated some day?; and he sank down a little deeper into the mud.  After some time a large White Duck swam up to him.  She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle.  ?Quack, quack, quack,? she said.  ?What a curious shape you are!  May I ask were you born like that, or is it the result of an accident??  ?It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country,? answered the Rocket, ?otherwise you would know who I am.  However, I excuse your ignorance.  It would be unfair to expect other people to be as remarkable as oneself.  You will no doubt be surprised to hear that I can fly up into the sky, and come down in a shower of golden rain.?  ?I don?t think much of that,? said the Duck, ?as I cannot see what use it is to any one.  Now, if you could plough the fields like the ox, or draw a cart like the horse, or look after the sheep like the collie-dog, that would be something.?  ?My good creature,? cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, ?I see that you belong to the lower orders.  A person of my position is never useful.  We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.  I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.  Indeed, I have always been of opinion that hard work is simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatever to do.?  ?Well, well,? said the Duck, who was of a very peaceable disposition, and never quarrelled with any one, ?everybody has different tastes.  I hope, at any rate, that you are going to take up your residence here.?  ?Oh! dear no,? cried the Rocket.  ?I am merely a visitor, a distinguished visitor.  The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.  There is neither society here, nor solitude.  In fact, it is essentially suburban. I shall probably go back to Court, for I know that I am destined to make a sensation in the world.?  ?I had thoughts of entering public life once myself,? remarked the Duck; ?there are so many things that need reforming.  Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.  However, they did not seem to have much effect.  Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family.?  ?I am made for public life,? said the Rocket, ?and so are all my relations, even the humblest of them.  Whenever we appear we excite great attention.  I have not actually appeared myself, but when I do so it will be a magnificent sight.  As for domesticity, it ages one rapidly, and distracts one's mind from higher things.?  ?Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are!? said the Duck; ?and that reminds me how hungry I feel?: and she swam away down the stream, saying, ?Quack, quack, quack.?  ?Come back! come back!? screamed the Rocket, ?I have a great deal to say to you?; but the Duck paid no attention to him.  ?I am glad that she has gone,? he said to himself, 'she has a decidedly middle-class mind?; and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots.  ?This must be the deputation,? said the Rocket, and he tried to look very dignified.  ?Hallo!? cried one of the boys, ?look at this old stick!  I wonder how it came here?; and he picked the rocket out of the ditch.  ?OLD Stick!? said the Rocket, ?impossible!  GOLD Stick, that is what he said.  Gold Stick is very complimentary.  In fact, he mistakes me for one of the Court dignitaries!?  ?Let us put it into the fire!? said the other boy, ?it will help to boil the kettle.?  So they piled the faggots together, and put the Rocket on top, and lit the fire.  ?This is magnificent,? cried the Rocket, ?they are going to let me off in broad day-lig|2
52|ht, so that every one can see me.?  ?We will go to sleep now,? they said, ?and when we wake up the kettle will be boiled?; and they lay down on the grass, and shut their eyes.  The Rocket was very damp, so he took a long time to burn.  At last, however, the fire caught him.  ?Now I am going off!? he cried, and he made himself very stiff and straight.  ?I know I shall go much higher than the stars, much higher than the moon, much higher than the sun.  In fact, I shall go so high that??  Fizz! Fizz! Fizz! and he went straight up into the air.  ?Delightful!? he cried, ?I shall go on like this for ever.  What a success I am!?  But nobody saw him.  Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.  ?Now I am going to explode,? he cried.  ?I shall set the whole world on fire, and make such a noise that nobody will talk about anything else for a whole year.?  And he certainly did explode.  Bang! Bang! Bang! went the gunpowder.  There was no doubt about it.  But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.  Then all that was left of him was the stick, and this fell down on the back of a Goose who was taking a walk by the side of the ditch.  ?Good heavens!? cried the Goose.  ?It is going to rain sticks?; and she rushed into the water.  ?I knew I should create a great sensation,? gasped the Rocket, and he went out.  FIRST ACT   SCENE   _The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern's house in Grosvenor Square_.  [_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_, _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French tapestry?representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by Boucher?that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS. MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_. _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks? to-night, Margaret?  LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don?t they?  LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.  LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn?t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.  LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don?t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!  LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.  LADY BASILDON.  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.  LADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!  [_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a young attach? known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]  MASON.  [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a portrait by Lawrence_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing young son been here?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  I don?t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing?  [MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_, _the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a flower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the mouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the astonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she is not reminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a Tanagra statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Because he leads such an idle life.  MABEL CHILTERN.  How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row at ten o?clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season.  You don?t call that leading an idle life, do you?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.] You are a very charming young lady!  MABEL CHILTERN.  How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you look so well with your star!  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London Society. Shouldn?t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife's milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham's bonnets.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.  Just what Society should be.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the other thing?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Gravely_.]  I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Into what?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a little curtsey_.]  I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!  MASON.  [_Announcing guests_.]  Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.  [_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY.  LADY MARKBY _is a pleasant_, _kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair ? la marquise and good lace_. MRS. CHEVELEY, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_.  _Lips very thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a pallid face_. _Venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_.  _Rouge accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_.  _Gray-green eyes that move restlessly_.  _She is in heliotrope_, _with diamonds_.  _She looks rather like an orchid_, _and makes great demands on one's curiosity_.  _In all her movements she is extremely graceful_.  _A work of art_, _on the whole_, _but showing the influence of too many schools_.]  LADY MARKBY.  Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming women should know each other!  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Advances towards_ MRS. CHEVELEY _with a sweet smile_. _Then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]  I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have met before.  I did not know she had married a second time.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Genially_.]  Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don?t they?  It is most fashionable.  [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.] Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Playing with her fan_.]  But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern?  I can?t remember where.  I have been out of England for so long.  LADY CHILTERN.  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Superciliously_.]  Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  I am not surprised!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In her sweetest manner_.]  Do you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna. They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That in itself is fame, on the continent.  LADY CHILTERN.  I hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!  [_Moves away_.]  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! ch?re Madame, queue surprise!  I have not seen you since Berlin!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  And you are younger and more beautiful than ever. How do you manage it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Yes, they have a wonderful language.  It should be more widely known.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters_.  _A man of forty_, _but looking somewhat younger_.  _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and dark-eyed_.  _A personality of mark_.  _Not popular?few personalities are_.  _But intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the many_.  _The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a slight touch of pride_.  _One feels that he is conscious of the success he has made in life_.  _A nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_. _The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the romantic expression in the deep-set eyes_.  _The variance is suggestive of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some violence of will-power_.  _There is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_.  _It would be inaccurate to call him picturesque_.  _Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons_. _But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought Sir John with you?  LADY MARKBY.  Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir John.  Sir John's temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our best to waste the public time, don?t we?  But who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us?  LADY MARKBY.  Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don?t know.  Families are so mixed nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.  LADY MARKBY.  She has just arrived from Vienna.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.  LADY MARKBY.  Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter. I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to see her.  LADY MARKBY.  Let me introduce you.  [_To_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bowing_.]  Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attach's at Vienna write to us about nothing else.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Really?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My prizes came a little later on in life.  I don?t think any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am sure they were for something charming!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I don?t know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.  But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I?m neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of them merely poses.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You prefer to be natural?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What would those modern psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . . merely adored.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple with the problem of women?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That is why it has no future before it, in this world.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the irrational.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a polite bow_.]  I fear I could hardly agree with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London?or perhaps the question is indiscreet?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes are.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I think they are more . . . becoming!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  A political life is a noble career!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  [_Drops her fan_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Picks up fan_.]  Allow me!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don?t care about the London season!  It is too matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman's curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man's!  I wanted immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.  I find that little things are so very difficult to do.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a moment's reflection_.]  No, I don?t think it is quite a little thing.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Later on.  [_Rises_.]  And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim?you remember the Baron??used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With an almost imperceptible start_.]  Did you know Baron Arnheim well?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Smiling_.]  Intimately.  Did you?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  At one time.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful man, wasn?t he?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  He was very remarkable, in many ways.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs. They would have been most interesting.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old Greek.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him.  MASON.  Lord Goring.  [_Enter_ LORD GORING.  _Thirty-four_, _but always says he is younger_. _A well-bred_, _expressionless face_.  _He is clever_, _but would not like to be thought so_.  _A flawless dandy_, _he would be annoyed if he were considered romantic_.  _He plays with life_, _and is on perfectly good terms with the world_.  _He is fond of being misunderstood_.  _It gives him a post of vantage_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I have met Lord Goring before.  LORD GORING.  [_Bowing_.]  I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My memory is under admirable control.  And are you still a bachelor?  LORD GORING.  I . . . believe so.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  How very romantic!  LORD GORING.  Oh! I am not at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I leave romance to my seniors.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Lord Goring is the result of Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  He reflects every credit on the institution.  LORD GORING.  May I ask are you staying in London long?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  That depends partly on the weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are not going to plunge us into a European war, I hope?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  There is no danger, at present!  [_She nods to_ LORD GORING, _with a look of amusement in her eyes_, _and goes out with_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  LORD GORING _saunters over to_ MABEL CHILTERN.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  You are very late!  LORD GORING.  Have you missed me?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!  LORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like being missed.  MABEL CHILTERN.  How very selfish of you!  LORD GORING.  I am very selfish.  MABEL CHILTERN.  You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord Goring.  LORD GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?  LORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to sleep at once.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn?t have you part with one of them.  LORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice.  By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?  LORD GORING.  I haven?t seen her for years, that is all.  MABEL CHILTERN.  What an absurd reason!  LORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.  MABEL CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?  LORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!  MABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her already.  LORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good taste.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  [_Approaching_.]  Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.  LORD GORING.  So the newspapers are always telling us.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I read all your English newspapers.  I find them so amusing.  LORD GORING.  Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between the lines.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I should like to, but my professor objects.  [_To_ MABEL CHILTERN.]  May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room, Mademoiselle?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Looking very disappointed_.]  Delighted, Vicomte, quite delighted!  [_Turning to_ LORD GORING.]  Aren?t you coming to the music-room?  LORD GORING.  Not if there is any music going on, Miss Mabel.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Severely_.]  The music is in German.  You would not understand it.  [_Goes out with the_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  LORD CAVERSHAM _comes up to his son_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir! what are you doing here?  Wasting your life as usual!  You should be in bed, sir.  You keep too late hours!  I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford's dancing till four o?clock in the morning!  LORD GORING.  Only a quarter to four, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Can?t make out how you stand London Society.  The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.  LORD GORING.  I love talking about nothing, father.  It is the only thing I know anything about.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure.  LORD GORING.  What else is there to live for, father?  Nothing ages like happiness.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You are heartless, sir, very heartless!  LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  Good evening, Lady Basildon!  LADY BASILDON.  [_Arching two pretty eyebrows_.]  Are you here?  I had no idea you ever came to political parties!  LORD GORING.  I adore political parties.  They are the only place left to us where people don?t talk politics.  LADY BASILDON.  I delight in talking politics.  I talk them all day long. But I can?t bear listening to them.  I don?t know how the unfortunate men in the House stand these long debates.  LORD GORING.  By never listening.  LADY BASILDON.  Really?  LORD GORING.  [_In his most serious manner_.]  Of course.  You see, it is a very dangerous thing to listen.  If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person.  LADY BASILDON.  Ah! that accounts for so much in men that I have never understood, and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in them!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_With a sigh_.]  Our husbands never appreciate anything in us.  We have to go to others for that!  LADY BASILDON.  [_Emphatically_.]  Yes, always to others, have we not?  LORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  That is exactly what we can?t stand.  My Reginald is quite hopelessly faultless.  He is really unendurably so, at times! There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him.  LORD GORING.  How terrible!  Really, the thing should be more widely known!  LADY BASILDON.  Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was a bachelor.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Pressing_ LADY BASILDON?S _hand_.]  My poor Olivia! We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.  LORD GORING.  I should have thought it was the husbands who were punished.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Drawing herself up_.]  Oh, dear no!  They are as happy as possible!  And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust us.  LADY BASILDON.  Perfectly tragic!  LORD GORING.  Or comic, Lady Basildon?  LADY BASILDON.  Certainly not comic, Lord Goring.  How unkind of you to suggest such a thing!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  I am afraid Lord Goring is in the camp of the enemy, as usual.  I saw him talking to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in.  LORD GORING.  Handsome woman, Mrs. Cheveley!  LADY BASILDON.  [_Stiffly_.]  Please don?t praise other women in our presence.  You might wait for us to do that!  LORD GORING.  I did wait.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Well, we are not going to praise her.  I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as far as she could see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies.  LORD GORING.  She is quite right, too.  The men are all dowdies and the women are all dandies, aren?t they?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_After a pause_.]  Oh! do you really think that is what Mrs. Cheveley meant?  LORD GORING.  Of course.  And a very sensible remark for Mrs. Cheveley to make, too.  [_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN.  _She joins the group_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Why are you talking about Mrs. Cheveley?  Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley!  Lord Goring says?what did you say, Lord Goring, about Mrs. Cheveley?  Oh! I remember, that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night.  LADY BASILDON.  What a horrid combination!  So very unnatural!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_In her most dreamy manner_.]  I like looking at geniuses, and listening to beautiful people.  LORD GORING.  Ah! that is morbid of you, Mrs. Marchmont!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Brightening to a look of real pleasure_.]  I am so glad to hear you say that.  Marchmont and I have been married for seven years, and he has never once told me that I was morbid.  Men are so painfully unobservant!  LADY BASILDON.  [_Turning to her_.]  I have always said, dear Margaret, that you were the most morbid person in London.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Ah! but you are always sympathetic, Olivia!  MABEL CHILTERN.  Is it morbid to have a desire for food?  I have a great desire for food.  Lord Goring, will you give me some supper?  LORD GORING.  With pleasure, Miss Mabel.  [_Moves away with her_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  How horrid you have been!  You have never talked to me the whole evening!  LORD GORING.  How could I?  You went away with the child-diplomatist.  MABEL CHILTERN.  You might have followed us.  Pursuit would have been only polite.  I don?t think I like you at all this evening!  LORD GORING.  I like you immensely.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I wish you?d show it in a more marked way!  [_They go downstairs_.]  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Olivia, I have a curious feeling of absolute faintness. I think I should like some supper very much.  I know I should like some supper.  LADY BASILDON.  I am positively dying for supper, Margaret!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these things.  LADY BASILDON.  Men are grossly material, grossly material!  [_The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC _enters from the music-room with some other guests_.  _After having carefully examined all the people present_, _he approaches_ LADY BASILDON.]  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  May I have the honour of taking you down to supper, Comtesse?  LADY BASILDON.  [_Coldly_.]  I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte. [_The_ VICOMTE _is about to retire_.  LADY BASILDON, _seeing this_, _rises at once and takes his arm_.]  But I will come down with you with pleasure.  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I am so fond of eating!  I am very English in all my tastes.  LADY BASILDON.  You look quite English, Vicomte, quite English.  [_They pass out_.  MR. MONTFORD, _a perfectly groomed young dandy_, _approaches_ MRS. MARCHMONT.]  MR. MONTFORD.  Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont?  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Languidly_.]  Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.  [_Rises hastily and takes his arm_.]  But I will sit beside you, and watch you.  MR. MONTFORD.  I don?t know that I like being watched when I am eating!  MRS. MARCHMONT.  Then I will watch some one else.  MR. MONTFORD.  I don?t know that I should like that either.  MRS. MARCHMONT.  [_Severely_.]  Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public!  [_They go downstairs with the other guests_, _passing_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY, _who now enter_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And are you going to any of our country houses before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  I can?t stand your English house-parties.  In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  That is so dreadful of them!  Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  And then the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  My stay in England really depends on you, Sir Robert.  [_Sits down on the sofa_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Taking a seat beside her_.]  Seriously?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.  What I don?t like are tedious, practical people.  There is a wide difference. Besides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes.  You were Lord Radley's secretary, weren?t you, when the Government bought the Suez Canal shares?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  But the Suez Canal was a very great|2
53| and splendid undertaking.  It gave us our direct route to India.  It had imperial value.  It was necessary that we should have control.  This Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  A speculation, Sir Robert!  A brilliant, daring speculation.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley, it is a swindle.  Let us call things by their proper names.  It makes matters simpler.  We have all the information about it at the Foreign Office.  In fact, I sent out a special Commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.  The whole thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had.  I hope you have not invested in it.  I am sure you are far too clever to have done that.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I have invested very largely in it.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Your old friend?and mine.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Who?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Baron Arnheim.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Frowning_.]  Ah! yes.  I remember hearing, at the time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  It was his last romance.  His last but one, to do him justice.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  But you have not seen my Corots yet. They are in the music-room.  Corots seem to go with music, don?t they? May I show them to you?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shaking her head_.]  I am not in a mood to-night for silver twilights, or rose-pink dawns.  I want to talk business. [_Motions to him with her fan to sit down again beside her_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I fear I have no advice to give you, Mrs. Cheveley, except to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  The success of the Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, and I am going to lay the report of the Commissioners before the House to-morrow night.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  That you must not do.  In your own interests, Sir Robert, to say nothing of mine, you must not do that.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Looking at her in wonder_.]  In my own interests? My dear Mrs. Cheveley, what do you mean?  [_Sits down beside her_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sir Robert, I will be quite frank with you.  I want you to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the House, on the ground that you have reasons to believe that the Commissioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.  Then I want you to say a few words to the effect that the Government is going to reconsider the question, and that you have reason to believe that the Canal, if completed, will be of great international value.  You know the sort of things ministers say in cases of this kind.  A few ordinary platitudes will do.  In modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good platitude.  It makes the whole world kin.  Will you do that for me?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me such a proposition!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I am quite serious.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  Pray allow me to believe that you are not.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Speaking with great deliberation and emphasis_.]  Ah! but I am.  And if you do what I ask you, I . . . will pay you very handsomely!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Pay me!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am afraid I don?t quite understand what you mean.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Leaning back on the sofa and looking at him_.]  How very disappointing!  And I have come all the way from Vienna in order that you should thoroughly understand me.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I fear I don?t.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In her most nonchalant manner_.]  My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the world, and you have your price, I suppose. Everybody has nowadays.  The drawback is that most people are so dreadfully expensive.  I know I am.  I hope you will be more reasonable in your terms.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rises indignantly_.]  If you will allow me, I will call your carriage for you.  You have lived so long abroad, Mrs. Cheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to an English gentleman.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Detains him by touching his arm with her fan_, _and keeping it there while she is talking_.]  I realise that I am talking to a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a Stock Exchange speculator a Cabinet secret.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Biting his lip_.]  What do you mean?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Rising and facing him_.]  I mean that I know the real origin of your wealth and your career, and I have got your letter, too.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What letter?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Contemptuously_.]  The letter you wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Radley's secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal shares?a letter written three days before the Government announced its own purchase.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Hoarsely_.]  It is not true.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You thought that letter had been destroyed.  How foolish of you!  It is in my possession.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  The affair to which you allude was no more than a speculation.  The House of Commons had not yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  It was a swindle, Sir Robert.  Let us call things by their proper names.  It makes everything simpler.  And now I am going to sell you that letter, and the price I ask for it is your public support of the Argentine scheme.  You made your own fortune out of one canal. You must help me and my friends to make our fortunes out of another!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is infamous, what you propose?infamous!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  This is the game of life as we all have to play it, Sir Robert, sooner or later!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I cannot do what you ask me.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You mean you cannot help doing it.  You know you are standing on the edge of a precipice.  And it is not for you to make terms.  It is for you to accept them.  Supposing you refuse?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What then?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My dear Sir Robert, what then?  You are ruined, that is all!  Remember to what a point your Puritanism in England has brought you.  In old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his neighbours.  In fact, to be a bit better than one's neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and middle-class.  Nowadays, with our modern mania for morality, every one has to pose as a paragon of purity, incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly virtues?and what is the result?  You all go over like ninepins?one after the other.  Not a year passes in England without somebody disappearing.  Scandals used to lend charm, or at least interest, to a man?now they crush him.  And yours is a very nasty scandal. You couldn?t survive it.  If it were known that as a young man, secretary to a great and important minister, you sold a Cabinet secret for a large sum of money, and that that was the origin of your wealth and career, you would be hounded out of public life, you would disappear completely.  And after all, Sir Robert, why should you sacrifice your entire future rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy?  For the moment I am your enemy.  I admit it!  And I am much stronger than you are.  The big battalions are on my side.  You have a splendid position, but it is your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable.  You can?t defend it!  And I am in attack.  Of course I have not talked morality to you.  You must admit in fairness that I have spared you that.  Years ago you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it turned out a great success.  You owe to it your fortune and position. And now you have got to pay for it.  Sooner or later we have all to pay for what we do.  You have to pay now.  Before I leave you to-night, you have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the House in favour of this scheme.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What you ask is impossible.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You must make it possible.  You are going to make it possible.  Sir Robert, you know what your English newspapers are like. Suppose that when I leave this house I drive down to some newspaper office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!  Think of their loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of the mud and mire they would plunge you in.  Think of the hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading article, and arranging the foulness of the public placard.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Stop!  You want me to withdraw the report and to make a short speech stating that I believe there are possibilities in the scheme?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Sitting down on the sofa_.]  Those are my terms.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_In a low voice_.]  I will give you any sum of money you want.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back your past.  No man is.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will not do what you ask me.  I will not.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You have to.  If you don?t . . . [_Rises from the sofa_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bewildered and unnerved_.]  Wait a moment!  What did you propose?  You said that you would give me back my letter, didn?t you?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  That is agreed.  I will be in the Ladies? Gallery to-morrow night at half-past eleven.  If by that time?and you will have had heaps of opportunity?you have made an announcement to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate the most suitable, compliment I can think of.  I intend to play quite fairly with you.  One should always play fairly . . . when one has the winning cards.  The Baron taught me that . . . amongst other things.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You must let me have time to consider your proposal.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  No; you must settle now!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Give me a week?three days!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Impossible!  I have got to telegraph to Vienna to-night.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My God! what brought you into my life?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Circumstances.  [_Moves towards the door_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Don?t go.  I consent.  The report shall be withdrawn.  I will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  I knew we should come to an amicable agreement.  I understood your nature from the first.  I analysed you, though you did not adore me.  And now you can get my carriage for me, Sir Robert.  I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen always get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_Exit_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  [_Enter Guests_, LADY CHILTERN, LADY MARKBY, LORD CAVERSHAM, LADY BASILDON, MRS. MARCHMONT, VICOMTE DE NANJAC, MR. MONTFORD.]  LADY MARKBY.  Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have enjoyed yourself. Sir Robert is very entertaining, is he not?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Most entertaining!  I have enjoyed my talk with him immensely.  LADY MARKBY.  He has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  And he has married a most admirable wife.  Lady Chiltern is a woman of the very highest principles, I am glad to say.  I am a little too old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I always admire people who do.  And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  But one can?t have everything, can one?  And now I must go, dear.  Shall I call for you to-morrow?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  LADY MARKBY.  We might drive in the Park at five.  Everything looks so fresh in the Park now!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Except the people!  LADY MARKBY.  Perhaps the people are a little jaded.  I have often observed that the Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of the brain.  However, I think anything is better than high intellectual pressure.  That is the most unbecoming thing there is.  It makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large.  And there is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose; men don?t like them.  Good-night, dear!  [_To_ LADY CHILTERN.]  Good-night, Gertrude!  [_Goes out on_ LORD CAVERSHAM?S _arm_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!  I have spent a delightful evening.  It has been so interesting getting to know your husband.  LADY CHILTERN.  Why did you wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I will tell you.  I wanted to interest him in this Argentine Canal scheme, of which I dare say you have heard.  And I found him most susceptible,'susceptible to reason, I mean.  A rare thing in a man.  I converted him in ten minutes.  He is going to make a speech in the House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.  We must go to the Ladies? Gallery and hear him!  It will be a great occasion!  LADY CHILTERN.  There must be some mistake.  That scheme could never have my husband's support.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I assure you it's all settled.  I don?t regret my tedious journey from Vienna now.  It has been a great success.  But, of course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead secret.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Gently_.]  A secret?  Between whom?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a flash of amusement in her eyes_.]  Between your husband and myself.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Entering_.]  Your carriage is here, Mrs. Cheveley!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks!  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Good-night, Lord Goring!  I am at Claridge's.  Don?t you think you might leave a card?  LORD GORING.  If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, don?t be so solemn about it, or I shall be obliged to leave a card on you.  In England I suppose that would hardly be considered en r?gle.  Abroad, we are more civilised.  Will you see me down, Sir Robert?  Now that we have both the same interests at heart we shall be great friends, I hope!  [_Sails out on_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN?S _arm_.  LADY CHILTERN _goes to the top of the staircase and looks down at them as they descend_.  _Her expression is troubled_.  _After a little time she is joined by some of the guests_, _and passes with them into another reception-room_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  What a horrid woman!  LORD GORING.  You should go to bed, Miss Mabel.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring!  LORD GORING.  My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  I don?t see why I shouldn?t give you the same advice.  I always pass on good advice. It is the only thing to do with it.  It is never of any use to oneself.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, you are always ordering me out of the room. I think it most courageous of you.  Especially as I am not going to bed for hours.  [_Goes over to the sofa_.]  You can come and sit down if you like, and talk about anything in the world, except the Royal Academy, Mrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch dialect.  They are not improving subjects.  [_Catches sight of something that is lying on the sofa half hidden by the cushion_.]  What is this?  Some one has dropped a diamond brooch!  Quite beautiful, isn?t it?  [_Shows it to him_.]  I wish it was mine, but Gertrude won?t let me wear anything but pearls, and I am thoroughly sick of pearls.  They make one look so plain, so good and so intellectual.  I wonder whom the brooch belongs to.  LORD GORING.  I wonder who dropped it.  MABEL CHILTERN.  It is a beautiful brooch.  LORD GORING.  It is a handsome bracelet.  MABEL CHILTERN.  It isn?t a bracelet.  It's a brooch.  LORD GORING.  It can be used as a bracelet.  [_Takes it from her_, _and_, _pulling out a green letter-case_, _puts the ornament carefully in it_, _and replaces the whole thing in his breast-pocket with the most perfect sang froid_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  What are you doing?  LORD GORING.  Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request to you.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Eagerly_.]  Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it all the evening.  LORD GORING.  [_Is a little taken aback_, _but recovers himself_.]  Don?t mention to anybody that I have taken charge of this brooch.  Should any one write and claim it, let me know at once.  MABEL CHILTERN.  That is a strange request.  LORD GORING.  Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody once, years ago.  MABEL CHILTERN.  You did?  LORD GORING.  Yes.  [LADY CHILTERN _enters alone_.  _The other guests have gone_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  Good-night, Gertrude!  [_Exit_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night, dear!  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  You saw whom Lady Markby brought here to-night?  LORD GORING.  Yes.  It was an unpleasant surprise.  What did she come here for?  LADY CHILTERN.  Apparently to try and lure Robert to uphold some fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  The Argentine Canal, in fact.  LORD GORING.  She has mistaken her man, hasn?t she?  LADY CHILTERN.  She is incapable of understanding an upright nature like my husband's!  LORD GORING.  Yes.  I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to get Robert into her toils.  It is extraordinary what astounding mistakes clever women make.  LADY CHILTERN.  I don?t call women of that kind clever.  I call them stupid!  LORD GORING.  Same thing often.  Good-night, Lady Chiltern!  LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night!  [_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, you are not going?  Do stop a little!  LORD GORING.  Afraid I can?t, thanks.  I have promised to look in at the Hartlocks?.  I believe they have got a mauve Hungarian band that plays mauve Hungarian music.  See you soon.  Good-bye!  [_Exit_]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  How beautiful you look to-night, Gertrude!  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it is not true, is it?  You are not going to lend your support to this Argentine speculation?  You couldn?t!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Starting_.]  Who told you I intended to do so?  LADY CHILTERN.  That woman who has just gone out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she calls herself now.  She seemed to taunt me with it.  Robert, I know this woman.  You don?t.  We were at school together.  She was untruthful, dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she could win.  I hated, I despised her.  She stole things, she was a thief. She was sent away for being a thief.  Why do you let her influence you?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it happened many years ago.  It is best forgotten!  Mrs. Cheveley may have changed since then.  No one should be entirely judged by their past.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  One's past is what one is.  It is the only way by which people should be judged.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That is a hard saying, Gertrude!  LADY CHILTERN.  It is a true saying, Robert.  And what did she mean by boasting that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to a thing I have heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme there has ever been in political life?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Biting his lip_.]  I was mistaken in the view I took.  We all may make mistakes.  LADY CHILTERN.  But you told me yesterday that you had received the report from the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole thing.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Walking up and down_.]  I have reasons now to believe that the Commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed. Besides, Gertrude, public and private life are different things.  They have different laws, and move on different lines.  LADY CHILTERN.  They should both represent man at his highest.  I see no difference between them.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Stopping_.]  In the present case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is all.  LADY CHILTERN.  All!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sternly_.]  Yes!  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert!  Oh! it is horrible that I should have to ask you such a question?Robert, are you telling me the whole truth?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why do you ask me such a question?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Why do you not answer it?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sitting down_.]  Gertrude, truth is a very complex thing, and politics is a very complex business.  There are wheels within wheels.  One may be under certain obligations to people that one must pay.  Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise. Every one does.  LADY CHILTERN.  Compromise?  Robert, why do you talk so differently to-night from the way I have always heard you talk?  Why are you changed?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am not changed.  But circumstances alter things.  LADY CHILTERN.  Circumstances should never alter principles!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But if I told you?  LADY CHILTERN.  What?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That it was necessary, vitally necessary?  LADY CHILTERN.  It can never be necessary to do what is not honourable. Or if it be necessary, then what is it that I have loved!  But it is not, Robert; tell me it is not.  Why should it be?  What gain would you get? Money?  We have no need of that!  And money that comes from a tainted source is a degradation.  Power?  But power is nothing in itself.  It is power to do good that is fine?that, and that only.  What is it, then? Robert, tell me why you are going to do this dishonourable thing!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, you have no right to use that word.  I told you it was a question of rational compromise.  It is no more than that.  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, that is all very well for other men, for men who treat life simply as a sordid speculation; but not for you, Robert, not for you.  You are different.  All your life you have stood apart from others.  You have never let the world soil you.  To the world, as to myself, you have been an ideal always.  Oh! be that ideal still.  That great inheritance throw not away?that tower of ivory do not destroy. Robert, men can love what is beneath them?things unworthy, stained, dishonoured.  We women worship when we love; and when we lose our worship, we lose everything.  Oh! don?t kill my love for you, don?t kill that!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!  LADY CHILTERN.  I know that there are men with horrible secrets in their lives?men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame?oh! don?t tell me you are such as they are!  Robert, is there in your life any secret dishonour or disgrace?  Tell me, tell me at once, that?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That what?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Speaking very slowly_.]  That our lives may drift apart.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Drift apart?  LADY CHILTERN.  That they may be entirely separate.  It would be better for us both.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you might not know.  LADY CHILTERN.  I was sure of it, Robert, I was sure of it.  But why did you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  Don?t let us ever talk about the subject again.  You will write, won?t you, to Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers?  If you have given her any promise you must take it back, that is all!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Must I write and tell her that?  LADY CHILTERN.  Surely, Robert!  What else is there to do?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I might see her personally.  It would be better.  LADY CHILTERN.  You must never see her again, Robert.  She is not a woman you should ever speak to.  She is not worthy to talk to a man like you. No; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your letter show her that your decision is quite irrevocable!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Write this moment!  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But it is so late.  It is close on twelve.  LADY CHILTERN.  That makes no matter.  She must know at once that she has been mistaken in you?and that you are not a man to do anything base or underhand or dishonourable.  Write here, Robert.  Write that you decline to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme. Yes?write the word dishonest.  She knows what that word means.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _sits down and writes a letter_.  _His wife takes it up and reads it_.]  Yes; that will do.  [_Rings bell_.]  And now the envelope.  [_He writes the envelope slowly_.  _Enter_ MASON.]  Have this letter sent at once to Claridge's Hotel.  There is no answer.  [_Exit_ MASON.  LADY CHILTERN _kneels down beside her husband_, _and puts her arms around him_.]  Robert, love gives one an instinct to things.  I feel to-night that I have saved you from something that might have been a danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less than they do.  I don?t think you realise sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, a finer attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher ideals?I know it, and for that I love you, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh, love me always, Gertrude, love me always!  LADY CHILTERN.  I will love you always, because you will always be worthy of love.  We needs must love the highest when we see it!  [_Kisses him and rises and goes out_.]  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _walks up and down for a moment_; _then sits down and buries his face in his hands_.  _The Servant enters and begins pulling out the lights_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _looks up_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Put out the lights, Mason, put out the lights!  [_The Servant puts out the lights_.  _The room becomes almost dark_. _The only light there is comes from the great chandelier that hangs over the staircase and illumines the tapestry of the Triumph of Love_.]  SECOND ACT   SCENE   _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern's house_.  [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an armchair_.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_. _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_. _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]  LORD GORING.  My dear Robert, it's a very awkward business, very awkward indeed.  You should have told your wife the whole thing.  Secrets from other people's wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  So, at least, I am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know better.  But no man should have a secret from his own wife.  She invariably finds it out.  Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, I couldn?t tell my wife.  When could I have told her?  Not last night.  It would have made a life-long separation between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  Last night it would have been quite impossible.  She would have turned from me in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.  LORD GORING.  Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.  LORD GORING.  [_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]  What a pity!  I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn?t quite mean that.  But if what you tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with Lady Chiltern.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It would be quite useless.  LORD GORING.  May I try?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.  LORD GORING.  Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological experiment.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  All such experiments are terribly dangerous.  LORD GORING.  Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn?t so, life wouldn?t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think you should have told her years ago.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?  LORD GORING.  [_Slowly_.]  Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There is no doubt of that.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Bitterly_.]  Men who every day do something of the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their own lives.  LORD GORING.  That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other people's secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No one.  LORD GORING.  [_Looking at him steadily_.]  Except yourself, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Of course I had private information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the source of every large modern fortune.  LORD GORING.|2
54|  [_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]  And public scandal invariably the result.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Pacing up and down the room_.]  Arthur, do you think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man's whole career should be ruined for a fault done in one's boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of one's youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?  LORD GORING.  Life is never fair, Robert.  And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons.  What this century worships is wealth.  The God of this century is wealth.  To succeed one must have wealth.  At all costs one must have wealth.  LORD GORING.  You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time for success.  I couldn?t wait.  LORD GORING.  Well, you certainly have had your success while you are still young.  No one in our day has had such a brilliant success. Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty?that's good enough for any one, I should think.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And if it is all taken away from me now?  If I lose everything over a horrible scandal?  If I am hounded from public life?  LORD GORING.  Robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Excitedly_.]  I did not sell myself for money.  I bought success at a great price.  That is all.  LORD GORING.  [_Gravely_.]  Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Baron Arnheim.  LORD GORING.  Damned scoundrel!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; he was a man of a most subtle and refined intellect.  A man of culture, charm, and distinction.  One of the most intellectual men I ever met.  LORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.  There is more to be said for stupidity than people imagine.  Personally I have a great admiration for stupidity.  It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I suppose. But how did he do it?  Tell me the whole thing.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Throws himself into an armchair by the writing-table_.]  One night after dinner at Lord Radley's the Baron began talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce to an absolutely definite science.  With that wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous of all gospels, the gospel of gold.  I think he saw the effect he had produced on me, for some days afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see him.  He was living then in Park Lane, in the house Lord Woolcomb has now.  I remember so well how, with a strange smile on his pale, curved lips, he led me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich possessed it.  LORD GORING.  [_With great deliberation_.]  A thoroughly shallow creed.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  I didn?t think so then.  I don?t think so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.  LORD GORING.  Fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  But tell me definitely, how did the Baron finally persuade you to?well, to do what you did?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  When I was going away he said to me that if I ever could give him any private information of real value he would make me a very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks later certain private documents passed through my hands.  LORD GORING.  [_Keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet_.]  State documents?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  [LORD GORING _sighs_, _then passes his hand across his forehead and looks up_.]  LORD GORING.  I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim held out to you.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one's life on a single moment, to risk everything on one throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not?there is no weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over the transaction.  LORD GORING.  And you?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I received from the Baron ?110,000.  LORD GORING.  You were worth more, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power over others.  I went into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in finance from time to time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my fortune.  Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a success.  In all things connected with money I have had a luck so extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  I remember having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.  LORD GORING.  But tell me, Robert, did you never suffer any regret for what you had done?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No.  I felt that I had fought the century with its own weapons, and won.  LORD GORING.  [_Sadly_.]  You thought you had won.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I thought so.  [_After a long pause_.]  Arthur, do you despise me for what I have told you?  LORD GORING.  [_With deep feeling in his voice_.]  I am very sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I don?t say that I suffered any remorse.  I didn?t. Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.  But I have paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that I might disarm destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in public charities since then.  LORD GORING.  [_Looking up_.]  In public charities?  Dear me! what a lot of harm you must have done, Robert!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh, don?t say that, Arthur; don?t talk like that!  LORD GORING.  Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I shouldn?t say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A great mistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  As regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can. Of course you know that.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you, Arthur, thank you.  But what is to be done?  What can be done?  LORD GORING.  [_Leaning back with his hands in his pockets_.]  Well, the English can?t stand a man who is always saying he is in the right, but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in the wrong.  It is one of the best things in them.  However, in your case, Robert, a confession would not do.  The money, if you will allow me to say so, is . . . awkward.  Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole affair, you would never be able to talk morality again.  And in England a man who can?t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral audience is quite over as a serious politician.  There would be nothing left for him as a profession except Botany or the Church.  A confession would be of no use.  It would ruin you.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It would ruin me.  Arthur, the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing out.  LORD GORING.  [_Rising from his chair_.]  I was waiting for you to say that, Robert.  It is the only thing to do now.  And you must begin by telling your wife the whole story.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That I will not do.  LORD GORING.  Robert, believe me, you are wrong.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I couldn?t do it.  It would kill her love for me. And now about this woman, this Mrs. Cheveley.  How can I defend myself against her?  You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.  LORD GORING.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Did you know her well?  LORD GORING.  [_Arranging his necktie_.]  So little that I got engaged to be married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys?.  The affair lasted for three days . . . nearly.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why was it broken off?  LORD GORING.  [_Airily_.]  Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter. By the way, have you tried her with money?  She used to be confoundedly fond of money.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I offered her any sum she wanted.  She refused.  LORD GORING.  Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down sometimes. The rich can?t do everything, after all.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Not everything.  I suppose you are right.  Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is in store for me.  I feel certain of it.  I never knew what terror was before.  I know it now.  It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one's heart.  It is as if one's heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow.  LORD GORING.  [_Striking the table_.]  Robert, you must fight her.  You must fight her.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But how?  LORD GORING.  I can?t tell you how at present.  I have not the smallest idea.  But every one has some weak point.  There is some flaw in each one of us.  [_Strolls to the fireplace and looks at himself in the glass_.] My father tells me that even I have faults.  Perhaps I have.  I don?t know.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  In defending myself against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a right to use any weapon I can find, have I not?  LORD GORING.  [_Still looking in the glass_.]  In your place I don?t think I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  She is thoroughly well able to take care of herself.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sits down at the table and takes a pen in his hand_.]  Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at Vienna, to inquire if there is anything known against her.  There may be some secret scandal she might be afraid of.  LORD GORING.  [_Settling his buttonhole_.]  Oh, I should fancy Mrs. Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park every afternoon at five-thirty.  I am sure she adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can?t manage to have enough of them.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Writing_.]  Why do you say that?  LORD GORING.  [_Turning round_.]  Well, she wore far too much rouge last night, and not quite enough clothes.  That is always a sign of despair in a woman.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Striking a bell_.]  But it is worth while my wiring to Vienna, is it not?  LORD GORING.  It is always worth while asking a question, though it is not always worth while answering one.  [_Enter_ MASON.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Is Mr. Trafford in his room?  MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Puts what he has written into an envelope_, _which he then carefully closes_.]  Tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once.  There must not be a moment's delay.  MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! just give that back to me again.  [_Writes something on the envelope_.  MASON _then goes out with the letter_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She must have had some curious hold over Baron Arnheim.  I wonder what it was.  LORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  I wonder.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will fight her to the death, as long as my wife knows nothing.  LORD GORING.  [_Strongly_.]  Oh, fight in any case?in any case.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  If my wife found out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I hear from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance, just a chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its own weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and she looks like a woman with a past, doesn?t she?  LORD GORING.  Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley's past is merely a slightly d?collet? one, and they are excessively popular nowadays. Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes on frightening Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who would be easily frightened.  She has survived all her creditors, and she shows wonderful presence of mind.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every chance. I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is round my feet, and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush! I hear my wife's voice.  [_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN _in walking dress_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Good afternoon, Lord Goring!  LORD GORING.  Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the Park?  LADY CHILTERN.  No; I have just come from the Woman's Liberal Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with loud applause, and now I have come in to have my tea.  [_To_ LORD GORING.] You will wait and have some tea, won?t you?  LORD GORING.  I?ll wait for a short time, thanks.  LADY CHILTERN.  I will be back in a moment.  I am only going to take my hat off.  LORD GORING.  [_In his most earnest manner_.]  Oh! please don?t.  It is so pretty.  One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  I hope the Woman's Liberal Association received it with loud applause.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_With a smile_.]  We have much more important work to do than look at each other's bonnets, Lord Goring.  LORD GORING.  Really?  What sort of work?  LADY CHILTERN.  Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts, Female Inspectors, the Eight Hours? Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise. . . . Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly uninteresting.  LORD GORING.  And never bonnets?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_With mock indignation_.]  Never bonnets, never!  [LADY CHILTERN _goes out through the door leading to her boudoir_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Takes_ LORD GORING?S _hand_.]  You have been a good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.  LORD GORING.  I don?t know that I have been able to do much for you, Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for you, as far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You have enabled me to tell you the truth.  That is something.  The truth has always stifled me.  LORD GORING.  Ah! the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as possible! Bad habit, by the way.  Makes one very unpopular at the club . . . with the older members.  They call it being conceited.  Perhaps it is.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I would to God that I had been able to tell the truth . . . to live the truth.  Ah! that is the great thing in life, to live the truth.  [_Sighs_, _and goes towards the door_.]  I?ll see you soon again, Arthur, shan?t I?  LORD GORING.  Certainly.  Whenever you like.  I?m going to look in at the Bachelors? Ball to-night, unless I find something better to do.  But I?ll come round to-morrow morning.  If you should want me to-night by any chance, send round a note to Curzon Street.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.  [_As he reaches the door_, LADY CHILTERN _enters from her boudoir_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  You are not going, Robert?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I have some letters to write, dear.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Going to him_.]  You work too hard, Robert.  You seem never to think of yourself, and you are looking so tired.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is nothing, dear, nothing.  [_He kisses her and goes out_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Do sit down.  I am so glad you have called.  I want to talk to you about . . . well, not about bonnets, or the Woman's Liberal Association.  You take far too much interest in the first subject, and not nearly enough in the second.  LORD GORING.  You want to talk to me about Mrs. Cheveley?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  You have guessed it.  After you left last night I found out that what she had said was really true.  Of course I made Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise.  LORD GORING.  So he gave me to understand.  LADY CHILTERN.  To have kept it would have been the first stain on a career that has been stainless always.  Robert must be above reproach. He is not like other men.  He cannot afford to do what other men do. [_She looks at_ LORD GORING, _who remains silent_.]  Don?t you agree with me?  You are Robert's greatest friend.  You are our greatest friend, Lord Goring.  No one, except myself, knows Robert better than you do.  He has no secrets from me, and I don?t think he has any from you.  LORD GORING.  He certainly has no secrets from me.  At least I don?t think so.  LADY CHILTERN.  Then am I not right in my estimate of him?  I know I am right.  But speak to me frankly.  LORD GORING.  [_Looking straight at her_.]  Quite frankly?  LADY CHILTERN.  Surely.  You have nothing to conceal, have you?  LORD GORING.  Nothing.  But, my dear Lady Chiltern, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that in practical life?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  Of which you know so little, Lord Goring?  LORD GORING.  Of which I know nothing by experience, though I know something by observation.  I think that in practical life there is something about success, actual success, that is a little unscrupulous, something about ambition that is unscrupulous always.  Once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to a certain point, if he has to climb the crag, he climbs the crag; if he has to walk in the mire?  LADY CHILTERN.  Well?  LORD GORING.  He walks in the mire.  Of course I am only talking generally about life.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope so.  Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring?  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, I have sometimes thought that . . . perhaps you are a little hard in some of your views on life.  I think that . . . often you don?t make sufficient allowances.  In every nature there are elements of weakness, or worse than weakness.  Supposing, for instance, that?that any public man, my father, or Lord Merton, or Robert, say, had, years ago, written some foolish letter to some one . . .  LADY CHILTERN.  What do you mean by a foolish letter?  LORD GORING.  A letter gravely compromising one's position.  I am only putting an imaginary case.  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert is as incapable of doing a foolish thing as he is of doing a wrong thing.  LORD GORING.  [_After a long pause_.]  Nobody is incapable of doing a foolish thing.  Nobody is incapable of doing a wrong thing.  LADY CHILTERN.  Are you a Pessimist?  What will the other dandies say? They will all have to go into mourning.  LORD GORING.  [_Rising_.]  No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist. Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.  All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.  If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at once to me.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Looking at him in surprise_.]  Lord Goring, you are talking quite seriously.  I don?t think I ever heard you talk seriously before.  LORD GORING.  [_Laughing_.]  You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.  It won?t occur again, if I can help it.  LADY CHILTERN.  But I like you to be serious.  [_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN, _in the most ravishing frock_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Dear Gertrude, don?t say such a dreadful thing to Lord Goring.  Seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.  Good afternoon Lord Goring!  Pray be as trivial as you can.  LORD GORING.  I should like to, Miss Mabel, but I am afraid I am . . . a little out of practice this morning; and besides, I have to be going now.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Just when I have come in!  What dreadful manners you have!  I am sure you were very badly brought up.  LORD GORING.  I was.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I wish I had brought you up!  LORD GORING.  I am so sorry you didn?t.  MABEL CHILTERN.  It is too late now, I suppose?  LORD GORING.  [_Smiling_.]  I am not so sure.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Will you ride to-morrow morning?  LORD GORING.  Yes, at ten.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Don?t forget.  LORD GORING.  Of course I shan?t.  By the way, Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in _The Morning Post_ of to-day.  It has apparently been crowded out by the County Council, or the Lambeth Conference, or something equally boring.  Could you let me have a list?  I have a particular reason for asking you.  LADY CHILTERN.  I am sure Mr. Trafford will be able to give you one.  LORD GORING.  Thanks, so much.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Tommy is the most useful person in London.  LORD GORING [_Turning to her_.]  And who is the most ornamental?  MABEL CHILTERN [_Triumphantly_.]  I am.  LORD GORING.  How clever of you to guess it!  [_Takes up his hat and cane_.]  Good-bye, Lady Chiltern!  You will remember what I said to you, won?t you?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes; but I don?t know why you said it to me.  LORD GORING.  I hardly know myself.  Good-bye, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN [_With a little moue of disappointment_.]  I wish you were not going.  I have had four wonderful adventures this morning; four and a half, in fact.  You might stop and listen to some of them.  LORD GORING.  How very selfish of you to have four and a half!  There won?t be any left for me.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I don?t want you to have any.  They would not be good for you.  LORD GORING.  That is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me. How charmingly you said it!  Ten to-morrow.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Sharp.  LORD GORING.  Quite sharp.  But don?t bring Mr. Trafford.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a little toss of the head_.]  Of course I shan?t bring Tommy Trafford.  Tommy Trafford is in great disgrace.  LORD GORING.  I am delighted to hear it.  [_Bows and goes out_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Gertrude, I wish you would speak to Tommy Trafford.  LADY CHILTERN.  What has poor Mr. Trafford done this time?  Robert says he is the best secretary he has ever had.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, Tommy has proposed to me again.  Tommy really does nothing but propose to me.  He proposed to me last night in the music-room, when I was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio going on.  I didn?t dare to make the smallest repartee, I need hardly tell you.  If I had, it would have stopped the music at once.  Musical people are so absurdly unreasonable.  They always want one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely deaf.  Then he proposed to me in broad daylight this morning, in front of that dreadful statue of Achilles.  Really, the things that go on in front of that work of art are quite appalling.  The police should interfere. At luncheon I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to propose again, and I just managed to check him in time by assuring him that I was a bimetallist.  Fortunately I don?t know what bimetallism means.  And I don?t believe anybody else does either.  But the observation crushed Tommy for ten minutes.  He looked quite shocked.  And then Tommy is so annoying in the way he proposes.  If he proposed at the top of his voice, I should not mind so much.  That might produce some effect on the public. But he does it in a horrid confidential way.  When Tommy wants to be romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.  I am very fond of Tommy, but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.  I wish, Gertrude, you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a manner that attracts some attention.  LADY CHILTERN.  Dear Mabel, don?t talk like that.  Besides, Robert thinks very highly of Mr. Trafford.  He believes he has a brilliant future before him.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I wouldn?t marry a man with a future before him for anything under the sun.  LADY CHILTERN.  Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  I know, dear.  You married a man with a future, didn?t you?  But then Robert was a genius, and you have a noble, self-sacrificing character.  You can stand geniuses.  I have no character at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever bear.  As a rule, I think they are quite impossible.  Geniuses talk so much, don?t they? Such a bad habit!  And they are always thinking about themselves, when I want them to be thinking about me.  I must go round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon's.  You remember, we are having tableaux, don?t you?  The Triumph of something, I don?t know what!  I hope it will be triumph of me.  Only triumph I am really interested in at present.  [_Kisses_ LADY CHILTERN _and goes out_; _then comes running back_.]  Oh, Gertrude, do you know who is coming to see you?  That dreadful Mrs. Cheveley, in a most lovely gown.  Did you ask her?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  Mrs. Cheveley!  Coming to see me? Impossible!  MABEL CHILTERN.  I assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life and not nearly so natural.  LADY CHILTERN.  You need not wait, Mabel.  Remember, Lady Basildon is expecting you.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I must shake hands with Lady Markby.  She is delightful.  I love being scolded by her.  [_Enter_ MASON.]  MASON.  Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.  [_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Advancing to meet them_.]  Dear Lady Markby, how nice of you to come and see me!  [_Shakes hands with her_, _and bows somewhat distantly to_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  Won?t you sit down, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  Isn?t that Miss Chiltern?  I should like so much to know her.  LADY CHILTERN.  Mabel, Mrs. Cheveley wishes to know you.  [MABEL CHILTERN _gives a little nod_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Sitting down_.]  I thought your frock so charming last night, Miss Chiltern.  So simple and . . . suitable.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Really?  I must tell my dressmaker.  It will be such a surprise to her.  Good-bye, Lady Markby!  LADY MARKBY.  Going already?  MABEL CHILTERN.  I am so sorry but I am obliged to.  I am just off to rehearsal.  I have got to stand on my head in some tableaux.  LADY MARKBY.  On your head, child?  Oh! I hope not.  I believe it is most unhealthy.  [_Takes a seat on the sofa next_ LADY CHILTERN.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  But it is for an excellent charity: in aid of the Undeserving, the only people I am really interested in.  I am the secretary, and Tommy Trafford is treasurer.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  And what is Lord Goring?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! Lord Goring is president.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  The post should suit him admirably, unless he has deteriorated since I knew him first.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Reflecting_.]  You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A little too modern, perhaps.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  I have known many instances of it.  MABEL CHILTERN.  What a dreadful prospect!  LADY MARKBY.  Ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  You will always be as pretty as possible.  That is the best fashion there is, and the only fashion that England succeeds in setting.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a curtsey_.]  Thank you so much, Lady Markby, for England . . . and myself.  [_Goes out_.]  LADY MARKBY.  [_Turning to_ LADY CHILTERN.]  Dear Gertrude, we just called to know if Mrs. Cheveley's diamond brooch has been found.  LADY CHILTERN.  Here?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I missed it when I got back to Claridge's, and I thought I mi|2
55|ght possibly have dropped it here.  LADY CHILTERN.  I have heard nothing about it.  But I will send for the butler and ask.  [_Touches the bell_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, pray don?t trouble, Lady Chiltern.  I dare say I lost it at the Opera, before we came on here.  LADY MARKBY.  Ah yes, I suppose it must have been at the Opera.  The fact is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that I wonder we have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.  I know myself that, when I am coming back from the Drawing Room, I always feel as if I hadn?t a shred on me, except a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows of the carriage.  The fact is that our Society is terribly over-populated.  Really, some one should arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration.  It would do a great deal of good.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.  It is nearly six years since I have been in London for the Season, and I must say Society has become dreadfully mixed.  One sees the oddest people everywhere.  LADY MARKBY.  That is quite true, dear.  But one needn?t know them.  I?m sure I don?t know half the people who come to my house.  Indeed, from all I hear, I shouldn?t like to.  [_Enter_ MASON.]  LADY CHILTERN.  What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby.  LADY MARKBY.  I thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear?  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Smiling_.]  No, lady Markby?a ruby.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Nodding her head_.]  And very becoming, I am quite sure.  LADY CHILTERN.  Has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the rooms this morning, Mason?  MASON.  No, my lady.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.  I am so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Coldly_.]  Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That will do, Mason.  You can bring tea.  [_Exit_ MASON.]  LADY MARKBY.  Well, I must say it is most annoying to lose anything.  I remember once at Bath, years ago, losing in the Pump Room an exceedingly handsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me.  I don?t think he has ever given me anything since, I am sorry to say.  He has sadly degenerated.  Really, this horrid House of Commons quite ruins our husbands for us.  I think the Lower House by far the greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called the Higher Education of Women was invented.  LADY CHILTERN.  Ah! it is heresy to say that in this house, Lady Markby. Robert is a great champion of the Higher Education of Women, and so, I am afraid, am I.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  The higher education of men is what I should like to see. Men need it so sadly.  LADY MARKBY.  They do, dear.  But I am afraid such a scheme would be quite unpractical.  I don?t think man has much capacity for development. He has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  With regard to women, well, dear Gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and I am sure it is all right if you approve of it.  In my time, of course, we were taught not to understand anything.  That was the old system, and wonderfully interesting it was.  I assure you that the amount of things I and my poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite extraordinary.  But modern women understand everything, I am told.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Except their husbands.  That is the one thing the modern woman never understands.  LADY MARKBY.  And a very good thing too, dear, I dare say.  It might break up many a happy home if they did.  Not yours, I need hardly say, Gertrude.  You have married a pattern husband.  I wish I could say as much for myself.  But since Sir John has taken to attending the debates regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language has become quite impossible.  He always seems to think that he is addressing the House, and consequently whenever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer, or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of the room.  It is not pleasant to see one's own butler, who has been with one for twenty-three years, actually blushing at the side-board, and the footmen making contortions in corners like persons in circuses.  I assure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send John at once to the Upper House.  He won?t take any interest in politics then, will he?  The House of Lords is so sensible.  An assembly of gentlemen.  But in his present state, Sir John is really a great trial.  Why, this morning before breakfast was half over, he stood up on the hearthrug, put his hands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the top of his voice.  I left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, I need hardly say.  But his violent language could be heard all over the house! I trust, Gertrude, that Sir Robert is not like that?  LADY CHILTERN.  But I am very much interested in politics, Lady Markby. I love to hear Robert talk about them.  LADY MARKBY.  Well, I hope he is not as devoted to Blue Books as Sir John is.  I don?t think they can be quite improving reading for any one.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Languidly_.]  I have never read a Blue Book.  I prefer books . . . in yellow covers.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Genially unconscious_.]  Yellow is a gayer colour, is it not?  I used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and would do so now if Sir John was not so painfully personal in his observations, and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  I think men are the only authorities on dress.  LADY MARKBY.  Really?  One wouldn?t say so from the sort of hats they wear? would one?  [_The butler enters_, _followed by the footman_.  _Tea is set on a small table close to_ LADY CHILTERN.]  LADY CHILTERN.  May I give you some tea, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  [_The butler hands_ MRS. CHEVELEY _a cup of tea on a salver_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Some tea, Lady Markby?  LADY MARKBY.  No thanks, dear.  [_The servants go out_.]  The fact is, I have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor Lady Brancaster, who is in very great trouble.  Her daughter, quite a well-brought-up girl, too, has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in Shropshire.  It is very sad, very sad indeed.  I can?t understand this modern mania for curates.  In my time we girls saw them, of course, running about the place like rabbits.  But we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say.  But I am told that nowadays country society is quite honeycombed with them.  I think it most irreligious.  And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord Brancaster always hides himself behind the money article in _The Times_.  However, I believe that is quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _The Times_ at all the clubs in St. James's Street; there are so many sons who won?t have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who won?t speak to their sons.  I think myself, it is very much to be regretted.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  So do I.  Fathers have so much to learn from their sons nowadays.  LADY MARKBY.  Really, dear?  What?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  The art of living.  The only really Fine Art we have produced in modern times.  LADY MARKBY.  [_Shaking her head_.]  Ah!  I am afraid Lord Brancaster knew a good deal about that.  More than his poor wife ever did. [_Turning to_ LADY CHILTERN.]  You know Lady Brancaster, don?t you, dear?  LADY CHILTERN.  Just slightly.  She was staying at Langton last autumn, when we were there.  LADY MARKBY.  Well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of happiness, as no doubt you noticed.  But there are many tragedies in her family, besides this affair of the curate.  Her own sister, Mrs. Jekyll, had a most unhappy life; through no fault of her own, I am sorry to say. She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.  No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.  I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.  [_Rising_.]  And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.  Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn?t mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.  As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I shan?t stay long.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Rising_.]  I don?t mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one.  LADY MARKBY.  Well, I hear the curate is always prowling about the house.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I am afraid I am not fond of girl friends.  LADY CHILTERN [_Rising_.]  Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheveley will stay here a little.  I should like to have a few minutes? conversation with her.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  How very kind of you, Lady Chiltern!  Believe me, nothing would give me greater pleasure.  LADY MARKBY.  Ah! no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of your schooldays to talk over together.  Good-bye, dear Gertrude!  Shall I see you at Lady Bonar's to-night?  She has discovered a wonderful new genius.  He does . . . nothing at all, I believe.  That is a great comfort, is it not?  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert and I are dining at home by ourselves to-night, and I don?t think I shall go anywhere afterwards.  Robert, of course, will have to be in the House.  But there is nothing interesting on.  LADY MARKBY.  Dining at home by yourselves?  Is that quite prudent?  Ah, I forgot, your husband is an exception.  Mine is the general rule, and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule. [_Exit_ LADY MARKBY.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn?t she?  Talks more and says less than anybody I ever met.  She is made to be a public speaker. Much more so than her husband, though he is a typical Englishman, always dull and usually violent.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Makes no answer_, _but remains standing_.  _There is a pause_.  _Then the eyes of the two women meet_.  LADY CHILTERN _looks stern and pale_.  MRS. CHEVELEY _seem rather amused_.]  Mrs. Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who you really were, I should not have invited you to my house last night.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_With an impertinent smile_.]  Really?  LADY CHILTERN.  I could not have done so.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I see that after all these years you have not changed a bit, Gertrude.  LADY CHILTERN.  I never change.  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Elevating her eyebrows_.]  Then life has taught you nothing?  LADY CHILTERN.  It has taught me that a person who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Would you apply that rule to every one?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes, to every one, without exception.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for you.  LADY CHILTERN.  You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any further acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite impossible?  MRS. CHEVELEY [_Leaning back in her chair_.]  Do you know, Gertrude, I don?t mind your talking morality a bit.  Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.  You dislike me.  I am quite aware of that.  And I have always detested you.  And yet I have come here to do you a service.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Contemptuously_.]  Like the service you wished to render my husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him from that.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Starting to her feet_.]  It was you who made him write that insolent letter to me?  It was you who made him break his promise?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Then you must make him keep it.  I give you till to-morrow morning?no more.  If by that time your husband does not solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am interested?  LADY CHILTERN.  This fraudulent speculation?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Call it what you choose.  I hold your husband in the hollow of my hand, and if you are wise you will make him do what I tell him.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising and going towards her_.]  You are impertinent. What has my husband to do with you?  With a woman like you?  MRS. CHEVELEY [_With a bitter laugh_.]  In this world like meets with like.  It is because your husband is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we pair so well together.  Between you and him there are chasms.  He and I are closer than friends.  We are enemies linked together.  The same sin binds us.  LADY CHILTERN.  How dare you class my husband with yourself?  How dare you threaten him or me?  Leave my house.  You are unfit to enter it.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters from behind_.  _He hears his wife's last words_, _and sees to whom they are addressed_.  _He grows deadly pale_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Your house!  A house bought with the price of dishonour. A house, everything in which has been paid for by fraud.  [_Turns round and sees_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  Ask him what the origin of his fortune is!  Get him to tell you how he sold to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret. Learn from him to what you owe your position.  LADY CHILTERN.  It is not true!  Robert!  It is not true!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Pointing at him with outstretched finger_.]  Look at him!  Can he deny it?  Does he dare to?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Go!  Go at once.  You have done your worst now.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  My worst?  I have not yet finished with you, with either of you.  I give you both till to-morrow at noon.  If by then you don?t do what I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of Robert Chiltern.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _strikes the bell_.  _Enter_ MASON.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Show Mrs. Cheveley out.  [MRS. CHEVELEY _starts_; _then bows with somewhat exaggerated politeness to_ LADY CHILTERN, _who makes no sign of response_.  _As she passes by_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, _who is standing close to the door_, _she pauses for a moment and looks him straight in the face_.  _She then goes out_, _followed by the servant_, _who closes the door after him_.  _The husband and wife are left alone_.  LADY CHILTERN _stands like some one in a dreadful dream_.  _Then she turns round and looks at her husband_.  _She looks at him with strange eyes_, _as though she were seeing him for the first time_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  You sold a Cabinet secret for money!  You began your life with fraud!  You built up your career on dishonour!  Oh, tell me it is not true!  Lie to me!  Lie to me!  Tell me it is not true!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What this woman said is quite true.  But, Gertrude, listen to me.  You don?t realise how I was tempted.  Let me tell you the whole thing. [_Goes towards her_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Don?t come near me.  Don?t touch me.  I feel as if you had soiled me for ever.  Oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these years!  A horrible painted mask!  You sold yourself for money.  Oh! a common thief were better.  You put yourself up to sale to the highest bidder!  You were bought in the market.  You lied to the whole world. And yet you will not lie to me.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rushing towards her_.]  Gertrude!  Gertrude!  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Thrusting him back with outstretched hands_.]  No, don?t speak!  Say nothing!  Your voice wakes terrible memories?memories of things that made me love you?memories of words that made me love you?memories that now are horrible to me.  And how I worshipped you!  You were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest, without stain.  The world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and goodness more real because you lived.  And now?oh, when I think that I made of a man like you my ideal! the ideal of my life!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  There was your mistake.  There was your error.  The error all women commit.  Why can?t you women love us, faults and all? Why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  We have all feet of clay, women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the more, it may be, for that reason.  It is not the perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love.  It is when we are wounded by our own hands, or by the hands of others, that love should come to cure us?else what use is love at all?  All sins, except a sin against itself, Love should forgive.  All lives, save loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man's love is like that.  It is wider, larger, more human than a woman's.  Women think that they are making ideals of men.  What they are making of us are false idols merely.  You made your false idol of me, and I had not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, tell you my weaknesses.  I was afraid that I might lose your love, as I have lost it now.  And so, last night you ruined my life for me?yes, ruined it!  What this woman asked of me was nothing compared to what she offered to me. She offered security, peace, stability.  The sin of my youth, that I had thought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, horrible, with its hands at my throat.  I could have killed it for ever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed its record, burned the one witness against me.  You prevented me.  No one but you, you know it.  And now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely dishonoured life, a lonely dishonoured death, it may be, some day? Let women make no more ideals of men! let them not put them on alters and bow before them, or they may ruin other lives as completely as you?you whom I have so wildly loved?have ruined mine!  [_He passes from the room_.  LADY CHILTERN _rushes towards him_, _but the door is closed when she reaches it_.  _Pale with anguish_, _bewildered_, _helpless_, _she sways like a plant in the water_.  _Her hands_, _outstretched_, _seem to tremble in the air like blossoms in the mind_. _Then she flings herself down beside a sofa and buries her face_.  _Her sobs are like the sobs of a child_.]                                   ACT DROP     THIRD ACT   SCENE   _The Library in Lord Goring's house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents the dominance of form_.  [_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_. _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher in the history of thought_.]  LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and presents new buttonhole on salver_.]  LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that,  LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths of other people.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society is oneself.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance, Phipps.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don?t think I quite like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?  PHIPPS.  I don?t observe any alteration in your lordship's appearance.  LORD GORING.  You don?t, Phipps?  PHIPPS.  No, my lord.  LORD GORING.  I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.  PHIPPS.  I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your lordship complains of in the buttonhole.  LORD GORING.  Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in England?they are always losing their relations.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord!  They are extremely fortunate in that respect.  LORD GORING.  [_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains impassive_.]  Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?  PHIPPS.  Three, my lord.  [_Hands letters on a salver_.]  LORD GORING.  [_Takes letters_.]  Want my cab round in twenty minutes.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Goes towards door_.]  LORD GORING.  [_Holds up letter in pink envelope_.]  Ahem!  Phipps, when did this letter arrive?  PHIPPS.  It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the club.  LORD GORING.  That will do.  [_Exit_ PHIPPS.]  Lady Chiltern's handwriting on Lady Chiltern's pink notepaper.  That is rather curious. I thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern has got to say to me?  [_Sits at bureau and opens letter_, _and reads it_.]  ?I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.?  [_Puts down the letter with a puzzled look_.  _Then takes it up_, _and reads it again slowly_.]  ?I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.?  So she has found out everything!  Poor woman!  Poor woman!  [ _Pulls out watch and looks at it_.]  But what an hour to call!  Ten o?clock!  I shall have to give up going to the Berkshires.  However, it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.  I am not expected at the Bachelors?, so I shall certainly go there.  Well, I will make her stand by her husband. That is the only thing for her to do.  That is the only thing for any woman to do.  It is the growth of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution.  Ten o?clock.  She should be here soon.  I must tell Phipps I am not in to any one else. [_Goes towards bell_]  [_Enter_ PHIPPS.]  PHIPPS.  Lord Caversham.  LORD GORING.  Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?  Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.] Delighted to see you, my dear father.  [_Goes to meet him_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Take my cloak off.  LORD GORING.  Is it worth while, father?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the most comfortable chair?  LORD GORING.  This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I have visitors.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room?  LORD GORING.  No, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Sitting down_.]  Glad to hear it.  Can?t stand draughts.  No draughts at home.  LORD GORING.  Good many breezes, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Eh?  Eh?  Don?t understand what you mean.  Want to have a serious conversation with you, sir.  LORD GORING.  My dear father!  At this hour?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, it is only ten o?clock.  What is your objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour!  LORD GORING.  Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What do you mean, sir?  LORD GORING.  During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday.  LORD GORING.  But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I must not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk in my sleep.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Talk in your sleep, sir?  What does that matter?  You are not married.  LORD GORING.  No, father, I am not married.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about, sir.  You have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme, sir, it is your duty to get married.  You can?t be always living for pleasure. Every man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are not fashionable any more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known about them.  You must get a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert Chiltern has got to by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  Why don?t you imitate him, sir?  Why don?t you take him for your model?  LORD GORING.  I think I shall, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy.  At present I make your mother's life miserable on your account.  You are heartless, sir, quite heartless.  LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  And it is high time for you to get married.  You are thirty-four years of age, sir.  LORD GORING.  Yes, father, but I only admit to thirty-two?thirty-one and a half when I have a really good buttonhole.  This buttonhole is not . . . trivial enough.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I tell you you are thirty-four, sir.  And there is a draught in your room, besides, which makes your conduct worse.  Why did you tell me there was no draught, sir?  I feel a draught, sir, I feel it distinctly.  LORD GORING.  So do I, father.  It is a dreadful draught.  I will come and see you to-morrow, father.  We can talk over anything you like.  Let me help you on with your cloak, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite purpose, and I am going to see it through at all costs to my health or yours.  Put down my cloak, sir.  LORD GORING.  Certainly, father.  But let us go into another room. [_Rings bell_.]  There is a dreadful draught here.  [_Enter_ PHIPPS.] Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  Come in there, father.  Your sneezes are quite heartrending.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, I suppose I have a right to sneeze when I choose?  LORD GORING.  [_Apologetically_.]  Quite so, father.  I was merely expressing sympathy.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Oh, damn sympathy.  There is a great deal too much of that sort of thing going on nowadays.  LORD GORING.  I quite agree with you, father.  If there was less sympathy in the world there would be less trouble in the world.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Going towards the smoking-room_.]  That is a paradox, sir.  I hate paradoxes.  LORD GORING.  So do I, father.  Everybody one meets is a paradox nowadays.  It is a great bore.  It makes society so obvious.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Turning round_, _and looking at his son beneath his bushy eyebrows_.]  Do you always really understand what you say, sir?  LORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Yes, father, if I listen attentively.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Indignantly_.]  If you listen attentively! . . . Conceited young puppy!  [_Goes off grumbling into the smoking-room_.  PHIPPS _enters_.]  LORD GORING.  Phipps, there is a lady coming to see me this evening on particular business.  Show her into the drawing-room when she arrives. You understand?  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  It is a matter of the gravest importance, Phipps.  PHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.  LORD GORING.  No one else is to be admitted, under any circumstances.  PHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.  [_Bell rings_.]  LORD GORING.  Ah! that is probably the lady.  I shall see her myself.  [_Just as he is going towards the door_ LORD CAVERSHAM _enters from the smoking-room_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir? am I to wait attendance on you?  LORD GORING.  [_Considerably perplexed_.]  In a moment, father.  Do excuse me.  [LORD CAVERSHAM _goes back_.]  Well, remember my instructions, Phipps?into that room.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [LORD GORING _goes into the smoking-room_.  HAROLD, _the footman shows_ MRS. CHEVELEY _in_.  _Lamia-like_, _she is in green and silver_.  _She has a cloak of black satin_, _lined with dead rose-leaf silk_.]  HAROLD.  What name, madam?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To_ PHIPPS, _who advances towards her_.]  Is Lord Goring not here?  I was told he was at home?  PHIPPS.  His lordship|2
56| is engaged at present with Lord Caversham, madam.  [_Turns a cold_, _glassy eye on_ HAROLD, _who at once retires_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To herself_.]  How very filial!  PHIPPS.  His lordship told me to ask you, madam, to be kind enough to wait in the drawing-room for him.  His lordship will come to you there.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a look of surprise_.]  Lord Goring expects me?  PHIPPS.  Yes, madam.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Are you quite sure?  PHIPPS.  His lordship told me that if a lady called I was to ask her to wait in the drawing-room.  [_Goes to the door of the drawing-room and opens it_.]  His lordship's directions on the subject were very precise.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To herself_]  How thoughtful of him!  To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [_Goes towards the drawing-room and looks in_.]  Ugh!  How dreary a bachelor's drawing-room always looks.  I shall have to alter all this.  [PHIPPS _brings the lamp from the writing-table_.]  No, I don?t care for that lamp.  It is far too glaring.  Light some candles.  PHIPPS.  [_Replaces lamp_.]  Certainly, madam.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I hope the candles have very becoming shades.  PHIPPS.  We have had no complaints about them, madam, as yet.  [_Passes into the drawing-room and begins to light the candles_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_To herself_.]  I wonder what woman he is waiting for to-night.  It will be delightful to catch him.  Men always look so silly when they are caught.  And they are always being caught.  [_Looks about room and approaches the writing-table_.]  What a very interesting room! What a very interesting picture!  Wonder what his correspondence is like. [_Takes up letters_.]  Oh, what a very uninteresting correspondence! Bills and cards, debts and dowagers!  Who on earth writes to him on pink paper?  How silly to write on pink paper!  It looks like the beginning of a middle-class romance.  Romance should never begin with sentiment.  It should begin with science and end with a settlement.  [_Puts letter down_, _then takes it up again_.]  I know that handwriting.  That is Gertrude Chiltern's.  I remember it perfectly.  The ten commandments in every stroke of the pen, and the moral law all over the page.  Wonder what Gertrude is writing to him about?  Something horrid about me, I suppose.  How I detest that woman!  [_Reads it_.]  ?I trust you.  I want you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.?  ?I trust you.  I want you.  I am coming to you.?  [_A look of triumph comes over her face_.  _She is just about to steal the letter_, _when_ PHIPPS _comes in_.]  PHIPPS.  The candles in the drawing-room are lit, madam, as you directed.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  [_Rises hastily and slips the letter under a large silver-cased blotting-book that is lying on the table_.]  PHIPPS.  I trust the shades will be to your liking, madam.  They are the most becoming we have.  They are the same as his lordship uses himself when he is dressing for dinner.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a smile_.]  Then I am sure they will be perfectly right.  PHIPPS.  [_Gravely_.]  Thank you, madam.  [MRS. CHEVELEY _goes into the drawing-room_.  PHIPPS _closes the door and retires_.  _The door is then slowly opened_, _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY _comes out and creeps stealthily towards the writing-table_.  _Suddenly voices are heard from the smoking-room_.  MRS. CHEVELEY _grows pale_, _and stops_.  _The voices grow louder_, _and she goes back into the drawing-room_, _biting her lip_.]  [_Enter_ LORD GORING _and_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  LORD GORING.  [_Expostulating_.]  My dear father, if I am to get married, surely you will allow me to choose the time, place, and person? Particularly the person.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Testily_.]  That is a matter for me, sir.  You would probably make a very poor choice.  It is I who should be consulted, not you.  There is property at stake.  It is not a matter for affection. Affection comes later on in married life.  LORD GORING.  Yes.  In married life affection comes when people thoroughly dislike each other, father, doesn?t it?  [_Puts on_ LORD CAVERSHAM?S _cloak for him_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Certainly, sir.  I mean certainly not, air.  You are talking very foolishly to-night.  What I say is that marriage is a matter for common sense.  LORD GORING.  But women who have common sense are so curiously plain, father, aren?t they?  Of course I only speak from hearsay.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  No woman, plain or pretty, has any common sense at all, sir.  Common sense is the privilege of our sex.  LORD GORING.  Quite so.  And we men are so self-sacrificing that we never use it, do we, father?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I use it, sir.  I use nothing else.  LORD GORING.  So my mother tells me.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  It is the secret of your mother's happiness.  You are very heartless, sir, very heartless.  LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  [_Goes out for a moment_.  _Then returns_, _looking rather put out_, _with_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, what a piece of good luck meeting you on the doorstep!  Your servant had just told me you were not at home. How extraordinary!  LORD GORING.  The fact is, I am horribly busy to-night, Robert, and I gave orders I was not at home to any one.  Even my father had a comparatively cold reception.  He complained of a draught the whole time.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! you must be at home to me, Arthur.  You are my best friend.  Perhaps by to-morrow you will be my only friend.  My wife has discovered everything.  LORD GORING.  Ah! I guessed as much!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Looking at him_.]  Really!  How?  LORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Oh, merely by something in the expression of your face as you came in.  Who told her?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley herself.  And the woman I love knows that I began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that I built up my life upon sands of shame?that I sold, like a common huckster, the secret that had been intrusted to me as a man of honour.  I thank heaven poor Lord Radley died without knowing that I betrayed him.  I would to God I had died before I had been so horribly tempted, or had fallen so low. [_Burying his face in his hands_.]  LORD GORING.  [_After a pause_.]  You have heard nothing from Vienna yet, in answer to your wire?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Looking up_.]  Yes; I got a telegram from the first secretary at eight o?clock to-night.  LORD GORING.  Well?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Nothing is absolutely known against her.  On the contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  It is a sort of open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion of his immense fortune.  Beyond that I can learn nothing.  LORD GORING.  She doesn?t turn out to be a spy, then?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! spies are of no use nowadays.  Their profession is over.  The newspapers do their work instead.  LORD GORING.  And thunderingly well they do it.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, I am parched with thirst.  May I ring for something?  Some hock and seltzer?  LORD GORING.  Certainly.  Let me.  [_Rings the bell_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thanks!  I don?t know what to do, Arthur, I don?t know what to do, and you are my only friend.  But what a friend you are?the one friend I can trust.  I can trust you absolutely, can?t I?  [_Enter_ PHIPPS.]  LORD GORING.  My dear Robert, of course.  Oh!  [_To_ PHIPPS.]  Bring some hock and seltzer.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  And Phipps!  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  LORD GORING.  Will you excuse me for a moment, Robert?  I want to give some directions to my servant.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Certainly.  LORD GORING.  When that lady calls, tell her that I am not expected home this evening.  Tell her that I have been suddenly called out of town. You understand?  PHIPPS.  The lady is in that room, my lord.  You told me to show her into that room, my lord.  LORD GORING.  You did perfectly right.  [_Exit_ PHIPPS.]  What a mess I am in.  No; I think I shall get through it.  I?ll give her a lecture through the door.  Awkward thing to manage, though.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, tell me what I should do.  My life seems to have crumbled about me.  I am a ship without a rudder in a night without a star.  LORD GORING.  Robert, you love your wife, don?t you?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I love her more than anything in the world.  I used to think ambition the great thing.  It is not.  Love is the great thing in the world.  There is nothing but love, and I love her.  But I am defamed in her eyes.  I am ignoble in her eyes.  There is a wide gulf between us now.  She has found me out, Arthur, she has found me out.  LORD GORING.  Has she never in her life done some folly'some indiscretion?that she should not forgive your sin?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My wife!  Never!  She does not know what weakness or temptation is.  I am of clay like other men.  She stands apart as good women do?pitiless in her perfection?cold and stern and without mercy. But I love her, Arthur.  We are childless, and I have no one else to love, no one else to love me.  Perhaps if God had sent us children she might have been kinder to me.  But God has given us a lonely house.  And she has cut my heart in two.  Don?t let us talk of it.  I was brutal to her this evening.  But I suppose when sinners talk to saints they are brutal always.  I said to her things that were hideously true, on my side, from my stand-point, from the standpoint of men.  But don?t let us talk of that.  LORD GORING.  Your wife will forgive you.  Perhaps at this moment she is forgiving you.  She loves you, Robert.  Why should she not forgive?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  God grant it!  God grant it!  [_Buries his face in his hands_.]  But there is something more I have to tell you, Arthur.  [_Enter_ PHIPPS _with drinks_.]  PHIPPS.  [_Hands hock and seltzer to_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  Hock and seltzer, sir.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.  LORD GORING.  Is your carriage here, Robert?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; I walked from the club.  LORD GORING.  Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps.  PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Exit_.]  LORD GORING.  Robert, you don?t mind my sending you away?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.  I have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.  The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.  [_A chair falls in the drawing-room_.]  What is that?  LORD GORING.  Nothing.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I heard a chair fall in the next room.  Some one has been listening.  LORD GORING.  No, no; there is no one there.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  There is some one.  There are lights in the room, and the door is ajar.  Some one has been listening to every secret of my life.  Arthur, what does this mean?  LORD GORING.  Robert, you are excited, unnerved.  I tell you there is no one in that room. Sit down, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Do you give me your word that there is no one there?  LORD GORING.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Your word of honour?  [_Sits down_.]  LORD GORING.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rises_.]  Arthur, let me see for myself.  LORD GORING.  No, no.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is no one there why should I not look in that room?  Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy myself. Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life's secret.  Arthur, you don?t realise what I am going through.  LORD GORING.  Robert, this must stop.  I have told you that there is no one in that room?that is enough.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Rushes to the door of the room_.]  It is not enough.  I insist on going into this room.  You have told me there is no one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me?  LORD GORING.  For God's sake, don?t!  There is some one there.  Some one whom you must not see.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah, I thought so!  LORD GORING.  I forbid you to enter that room.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Stand back.  My life is at stake.  And I don?t care who is there.  I will know who it is to whom I have told my secret and my shame.  [_Enters room_.]  LORD GORING.  Great heavens! his own wife!  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _comes back_, _with a look of scorn and anger on his face_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What explanation have you to give me for the presence of that woman here?  LORD GORING.  Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She is a vile, an infamous thing!  LORD GORING.  Don?t say that, Robert!  It was for your sake she came here.  It was to try and save you she came here.  She loves you and no one else.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are mad.  What have I to do with her intrigues with you?  Let her remain your mistress!  You are well suited to each other.  She, corrupt and shameful?you, false as a friend, treacherous as an enemy even?  LORD GORING.  It is not true, Robert.  Before heaven, it is not true.  In her presence and in yours I will explain all.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Let me pass, sir.  You have lied enough upon your word of honour.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _goes out_.  LORD GORING _rushes to the door of the drawing-room_, _when_ MRS. CHEVELEY _comes out_, _looking radiant and much amused_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a mock curtsey_]  Good evening, Lord Goring!  LORD GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley!  Great heavens! . . . May I ask what you were doing in my drawing-room?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Merely listening.  I have a perfect passion for listening through keyholes.  One always hears such wonderful things through them.  LORD GORING.  Doesn?t that sound rather like tempting Providence?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! surely Providence can resist temptation by this time. [_Makes a sign to him to take her cloak off_, _which he does_.]  LORD GORING.  I am glad you have called.  I am going to give you some good advice.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! pray don?t.  One should never give a woman anything that she can?t wear in the evening.  LORD GORING.  I see you are quite as wilful as you used to be.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Far more!  I have greatly improved.  I have had more experience.  LORD GORING.  Too much experience is a dangerous thing.  Pray have a cigarette.  Half the pretty women in London smoke cigarettes.  Personally I prefer the other half.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  I never smoke.  My dressmaker wouldn?t like it, and a woman's first duty in life is to her dressmaker, isn?t it?  What the second duty is, no one has as yet discovered.  LORD GORING.  You have come here to sell me Robert Chiltern's letter, haven?t you?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  To offer it to you on conditions.  How did you guess that?  LORD GORING.  Because you haven?t mentioned the subject.  Have you got it with you?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Sitting down_.]  Oh, no!  A well-made dress has no pockets.  LORD GORING.  What is your price for it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  How absurdly English you are!  The English think that a cheque-book can solve every problem in life.  Why, my dear Arthur, I have very much more money than you have, and quite as much as Robert Chiltern has got hold of.  Money is not what I want.  LORD GORING.  What do you want then, Mrs. Cheveley?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Why don?t you call me Laura?  LORD GORING.  I don?t like the name.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You used to adore it.  LORD GORING.  Yes: that's why.  [MRS. CHEVELEY _motions to him to sit down beside her_.  _He smiles_, _and does so_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Arthur, you loved me once.  LORD GORING.  Yes.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  And you asked me to be your wife.  LORD GORING.  That was the natural result of my loving you.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  And you threw me over because you saw, or said you saw, poor old Lord Mortlake trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the conservatory at Tenby.  LORD GORING.  I am under the impression that my lawyer settled that matter with you on certain terms . . . dictated by yourself.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  At that time I was poor; you were rich.  LORD GORING.  Quite so.  That is why you pretended to love me.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shrugging her shoulders_.]  Poor old Lord Mortlake, who had only two topics of conversation, his gout and his wife!  I never could quite make out which of the two he was talking about.  He used the most horrible language about them both.  Well, you were silly, Arthur. Why, Lord Mortlake was never anything more to me than an amusement.  One of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an English country house on an English country Sunday.  I don?t think any one at all morally responsible for what he or she does at an English country house.  LORD GORING.  Yes.  I know lots of people think that.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I loved you, Arthur.  LORD GORING.  My dear Mrs. Cheveley, you have always been far too clever to know anything about love.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I did love you.  And you loved me.  You know you loved me; and love is a very wonderful thing.  I suppose that when a man has once loved a woman, he will do anything for her, except continue to love her?  [_Puts her hand on his_.]  LORD GORING.  [_Taking his hand away quietly_.]  Yes: except that.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  I am tired of living abroad.  I want to come back to London.  I want to have a charming house here.  I want to have a salon.  If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilised.  Besides, I have arrived at the romantic stage.  When I saw you last night at the Chilterns?, I knew you were the only person I had ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, Arthur.  And so, on the morning of the day you marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern's letter.  That is my offer.  I will give it to you now, if you promise to marry me.  LORD GORING.  Now?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Smiling_.]  To-morrow.  LORD GORING.  Are you really serious?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes, quite serious.  LORD GORING.  I should make you a very bad husband.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I don?t mind bad husbands.  I have had two.  They amused me immensely.  LORD GORING.  You mean that you amused yourself immensely, don?t you?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  What do you know about my married life?  LORD GORING.  Nothing: but I can read it like a book.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  What book?  LORD GORING.  [_Rising_.]  The Book of Numbers.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to a woman in your own house?  LORD GORING.  In the case of very fascinating women, sex is a challenge, not a defence.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I suppose that is meant for a compliment.  My dear Arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.  Men always are.  That is the difference between the two sexes.  LORD GORING.  Women are never disarmed by anything, as far as I know them.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  Then you are going to allow your greatest friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some one who really has considerable attractions left.  I thought you would have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, Arthur.  I think you should.  And the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your own perfections.  LORD GORING.  Oh! I do that as it is.  And self-sacrifice is a thing that should be put down by law.  It is so demoralising to the people for whom one sacrifices oneself.  They always go to the bad.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  As if anything could demoralise Robert Chiltern!  You seem to forget that I know his real character.  LORD GORING.  What you know about him is not his real character.  It was an act of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, I admit, shameful, I admit, unworthy of him, I admit, and therefore . . . not his true character.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  How you men stand up for each other!  LORD GORING.  How you women war against each other!  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Bitterly_.]  I only war against one woman, against Gertrude Chiltern.  I hate her.  I hate her now more than ever.  LORD GORING.  Because you have brought a real tragedy into her life, I suppose.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a sneer_.]  Oh, there is only one real tragedy in a woman's life.  The fact that her past is always her lover, and her future invariably her husband.  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern knows nothing of the kind of life to which you are alluding.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  A woman whose size in gloves is seven and three-quarters never knows much about anything.  You know Gertrude has always worn seven and three-quarters?  That is one of the reasons why there was never any moral sympathy between us. . . . Well, Arthur, I suppose this romantic interview may be regarded as at an end.  You admit it was romantic, don?t you?  For the privilege of being your wife I was ready to surrender a great prize, the climax of my diplomatic career.  You decline.  Very well.  If Sir Robert doesn?t uphold my Argentine scheme, I expose him. Voil? tout.  LORD GORING.  You mustn?t do that.  It would be vile, horrible, infamous.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Shrugging her shoulders_.]  Oh! don?t use big words. They mean so little.  It is a commercial transaction.  That is all. There is no good mixing up sentimentality in it.  I offered to sell Robert Chiltern a certain thing.  If he won?t pay me my price, he will have to pay the world a greater price.  There is no more to be said.  I must go.  Good-bye.  Won?t you shake hands?  LORD GORING.  With you?  No.  Your transaction with Robert Chiltern may pass as a loathsome commercial transaction of a loathsome commercial age; but you seem to have forgotten that you came here to-night to talk of love, you whose lips desecrated the word love, you to whom the thing is a book closely sealed, went this afternoon to the house of one of the most noble and gentle women in the world to degrade her husband in her eyes, to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and bitterness in her life, to break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her soul.  That I cannot forgive you.  That was horrible.  For that there can be no forgiveness.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Arthur, you are unjust to me.  Believe me, you are quite unjust to me.  I didn?t go to taunt Gertrude at all.  I had no idea of doing anything of the kind when I entered.  I called with Lady Markby simply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that I lost somewhere last night, had been found at the Chilterns?.  If you don?t believe me, you can ask Lady Markby.  She will tell you it is true.  The scene that occurred happened after Lady Markby had left, and was really forced on me by Gertrude's rudeness and sneers.  I called, oh!?a little out of malice if you like?but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been found. That was the origin of the whole thing.  LORD GORING.  A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  How do you know?  LORD GORING.  Because it is found.  In point of fact, I found it myself, and stupidly forgot to tell the butler anything about it as I was leaving.  [_Goes over to the writing-table and pulls out the drawers_.] It is in this drawer.  No, that one.  This is the brooch, isn?t it? [_Holds up the brooch_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I am so glad to get it back.  It was . . a present.  LORD GORING.  Won?t you wear it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Certainly, if you pin it in.  [LORD GORING _suddenly clasps it on her arm_.]  Why do you put it on as a bracelet?  I never knew it could he worn as a bracelet.  LORD GORING.  Really?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Holding out her handsome arm_.]  No; but it looks very well on me as a bracelet, doesn?t it?  LORD GORING.  Yes; much better than when I saw it last.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  When did you see it last?  LORD GORING.  [_Calmly_.]  Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Starting_.]  What do you mean?  LORD GORING.  I mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, Mary Berkshire, to whom I gave it when she was married.  Suspicion fell on a wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace.  I recognised it last night.  I determined to say nothing about it till I had found the thief. I have found the thief now, and I have heard her own confession.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Tossing her head_.]  It is not true.  LORD GORING.  You know it is true.  Why, thief is written across your face at this moment.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I will deny the whole affair from beginning to end.  I will say that I have never seen this wretched thing, that it was never in my possession.  [MRS. CHEVELEY _tries to get the bracelet off her arm_, _but fails_. LORD GORING _looks on amused_.  _Her thin fingers tear at the jewel to no purpose_.  _A curse breaks from her_.]  LORD GORING.  The drawback of stealing a thing, Mrs. Cheveley, is that one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.  You can?t get that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is.  And I see you don?t know where the spring is.  It is rather difficult to find.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  You brute!  You coward!  [_She tries again to unclasp the bracelet_, _but fails_.]  LORD GORING.  Oh! don?t use big words.  They mean so little.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Again tears at the bracelet in a paroxysm of rage_, _with inarticulate sounds_.  _Then stops_, _and looks at_ LORD GORING.] What are you going to do?  LORD GORING.  I am going to ring for my servant.  He is an admirable servant.  Always comes in the moment one rings for him.  When he comes I will tell him to fetch the police.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Trembling_.]  The police?  What for?  LORD GORING.  To-morrow the Berkshires will prosecute you.  That is what the police are for.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Is now in an agony of physical terror_.  _Her face is distorted_.  _Her mouth awry_.  _A mask has fallen from her_.  _She it_, _for the moment_, _dreadful to look at_.]  Don?t do that.  I will do anything you want.  Anything in the world you want.  LORD GORING.  Give me Robert Chiltern's letter.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Stop! Stop!  Let me have time to think.  LORD GORING.  Give me Robert Chiltern's letter.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I have not got it with me.  I will give it to you to-morrow.  LORD GORING.  You know you are lying.  Give it to me at once.  [MRS. CHEVELEY _pulls the letter out_, _and hands it to him_.  _She is horribly pale_.]  This is it?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_In a hoarse voice_.]  Yes.  LORD GORING.  [_Takes the letter_, _examines it_, _sighs_, _and burns it with the lamp_.]  For so well-dressed a woman, Mrs. Cheveley, you have moments of admirable common sense.  I congratulate you.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Catches sight of_ LADY CHILTERN?S _letter_, _the cover of which is just showing from under the blotting-book_.]  Please get me a glass of water.  LORD GORING.  Certainly.  [_Goes to the corner of the room and pours out a glass of water_.  _While his back is turned_ MRS. CHEVELEY _steals_ LADY CHILTERN?S _letter_.  _When_ LORD GORING _returns the glass she refuses it with a gesture_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  Will you help me on with my cloak?  LORD GORING.  With pleasure.  [_Puts her cloak on_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.  I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern again.  LORD GORING.  Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn?t.  On the contrary, I am going to render him a great service.  LORD GORING.  I am charmed to hear it.  It is a reformation.  MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I can?t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so?  LORD GORING.  Well?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern's dying speech and confession has strayed into my pocket.  LORD GORING.  What do you mean?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_With a bitter note of triumph in her voice_.]  I mean that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to you to-night.  LORD GORING.  Love-letter?  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_Laughing_.]  ?I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.?  [LORD GORING _rushes to the bureau and takes up the envelope_, _finds is empty_, _and turns round_.]  LORD GORING.  You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  Give me back that letter.  I?ll take it from you by force.  You shall not leave my room till I have got it.  [_He rushes towards her_, _but_ MRS. CHEVELEY _at once puts her hand on the electric bell that is on the table_. _The bell sounds with shrill reverberations_, _and_ PHIPPS _enters_.]  MRS. CHEVELEY.  [_After a pause_.]  Lord Goring merely rang that you should show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!  [_Goes out followed by_ PHIPPS.  _Her face it illumined with evil triumph_.  _There is joy in her eyes_.  _Youth seems to have come back to her_.  _Her last glance is like a swift arrow_.  LORD GORING _bites his lip_, _and lights his a cigarette_.|2
57|]                                  ACT DROPS     FOURTH ACT   SCENE   _Same as Act II_.  [LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]  LORD GORING.  [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the bell_.]  It is a great nuisance.  I can?t find any one in this house to talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the latest edition of something or other.  [_Enter servant_.]  JAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down yet?  JAMES.  Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just come in from riding.  LORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.  JAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.  LORD GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I?ve gone?  JAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.  [_Exit servant_.]  LORD GORING.  Really, I don?t want to meet my father three days running. It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness he won?t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and begins to read it_.]  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time as usual, I suppose?  LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people's time, not one's own.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about last night?  LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?  LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you.  LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I?d sooner be engaged before lunch.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.  LORD GORING.  Neither do I, father.  [_A pause_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?  LORD GORING.  [_Airily_.]  The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading article on Robert Chiltern's career?  LORD GORING.  Good heavens!  No.  What does it say?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of course.  Chiltern's speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since Canning.  LORD GORING.  Ah!  Never heard of Canning.  Never wanted to.  And did . . . did Chiltern uphold the scheme?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, he denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance. This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points out.  You should read this article, sir.  [_Opens_ The Times.]  ?Sir Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.?  They will never say that of you, sir.  LORD GORING.  I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am delighted at what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows he has got pluck.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.  LORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, nowadays, as genius is.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would go into Parliament.  LORD GORING.  My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don?t you try to do something useful in life?  LORD GORING.  I am far too young.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Testily_.]  I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.  LORD GORING.  Youth isn?t an affectation.  Youth is an art.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don?t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?  LORD GORING.  I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the morning.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I don?t suppose there is the smallest chance of her accepting you.  LORD GORING.  I don?t know how the betting stands to-day.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in England.  LORD GORING.  That is just what I should like to marry.  A thoroughly sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less than six months.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You don?t deserve her, sir.  LORD GORING.  My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.  [_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! . . . How do you do, Lord Caversham?  I hope Lady Caversham is quite well?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Caversham is as usual, as usual.  LORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Taking no notice at all of_ LORD GORING, _and addressing herself exclusively to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  And Lady Caversham's bonnets . . . are they at all better?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say.  LORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_To_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  I hope an operation will not be necessary.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Smiling at her pertness_.]  If it is, we shall have to give Lady Caversham a narcotic.  Otherwise she would never consent to have a feather touched.  LORD GORING.  [_With increased emphasis_.]  Good morning, Miss Mabel!  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Turning round with feigned surprise_.]  Oh, are you here?  Of course you understand that after your breaking your appointment I am never going to speak to you again.  LORD GORING.  Oh, please don?t say such a thing.  You are the one person in London I really like to have to listen to me.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, I never believe a single word that either you or I say to each other.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You are quite right, my dear, quite right . . . as far as he is concerned, I mean.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Do you think you could possibly make your son behave a little better occasionally?  Just as a change.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no influence at all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know what I would make him do.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible to influence.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  He is very heartless, very heartless.  LORD GORING.  It seems to me that I am a little in the way here.  MABEL CHILTERN.  It is very good for you to be in the way, and to know what people say of you behind your back.  LORD GORING.  I don?t at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back.  It makes me far too conceited.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  After that, my dear, I really must bid you good morning.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! I hope you are not going to leave me all alone with Lord Goring?  Especially at such an early hour in the day.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I am afraid I can?t take him with me to Downing Street. It is not the Prime Minster's day for seeing the unemployed.  [_Shakes hands with_ MABEL CHILTERN, _takes up his hat and stick_, _and goes out_, _with a parting glare of indignation at_ LORD GORING.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Takes up roses and begins to arrange them in a bowl on the table_.]  People who don?t keep their appointments in the Park are horrid.  LORD GORING.  Detestable.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I am glad you admit it.  But I wish you wouldn?t look so pleased about it.  LORD GORING.  I can?t help it.  I always look pleased when I am with you.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  Then I suppose it is my duty to remain with you?  LORD GORING.  Of course it is.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, my duty is a thing I never do, on principle.  It always depresses me.  So I am afraid I must leave you.  LORD GORING.  Please don?t, Miss Mabel.  I have something very particular to say to you.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Rapturously_.]  Oh! is it a proposal?  LORD GORING.  [_Somewhat taken aback_.]  Well, yes, it is?I am bound to say it is.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a sigh of pleasure_.]  I am so glad.  That makes the second to-day.  LORD GORING.  [_Indignantly_.]  The second to-day?  What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you?  MABEL CHILTERN.  Tommy Trafford, of course.  It is one of Tommy's days for proposing.  He always proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during the Season.  LORD GORING.  You didn?t accept him, I hope?  MABEL CHILTERN.  I make it a rule never to accept Tommy.  That is why he goes on proposing.  Of course, as you didn?t turn up this morning, I very nearly said yes.  It would have been an excellent lesson both for him and for you if I had.  It would have taught you both better manners.  LORD GORING.  Oh! bother Tommy Trafford.  Tommy is a silly little ass.  I love you.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I know.  And I think you might have mentioned it before. I am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities.  LORD GORING.  Mabel, do be serious.  Please be serious.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Ah! that is the sort of thing a man always says to a girl before he has been married to her.  He never says it afterwards.  LORD GORING.  [_Taking hold of her hand_.]  Mabel, I have told you that I love you.  Can?t you love me a little in return?  MABEL CHILTERN.  You silly Arthur!  If you knew anything about . . . anything, which you don?t, you would know that I adore you.  Every one in London knows it except you.  It is a public scandal the way I adore you. I have been going about for the last six months telling the whole of society that I adore you.  I wonder you consent to have anything to say to me.  I have no character left at all.  At least, I feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all.  LORD GORING.  [_Catches her in his arms and kisses her_.  _Then there is a pause of bliss_.]  Dear!  Do you know I was awfully afraid of being refused!  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Looking up at him_.]  But you never have been refused yet by anybody, have you, Arthur?  I can?t imagine any one refusing you.  LORD GORING.  [_After kissing her again_.]  Of course I?m not nearly good enough for you, Mabel.  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Nestling close to him_.]  I am so glad, darling.  I was afraid you were.  LORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  And I?m . . . I?m a little over thirty.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Dear, you look weeks younger than that.  LORD GORING.  [_Enthusiastically_.]  How sweet of you to say so! . . . And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully extravagant.  MABEL CHILTERN.  But so am I, Arthur.  So we?re sure to agree.  And now I must go and see Gertrude.  LORD GORING.  Must you really?  [_Kisses her_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Yes.  LORD GORING.  Then do tell her I want to talk to her particularly.  I have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or Robert.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Do you mean to say you didn?t come here expressly to propose to me?  LORD GORING.  [_Triumphantly_.]  No; that was a flash of genius.  MABEL CHILTERN.  Your first.  LORD GORING.  [_With determination_.]  My last.  MABEL CHILTERN.  I am delighted to hear it.  Now don?t stir.  I?ll be back in five minutes.  And don?t fall into any temptations while I am away.  LORD GORING.  Dear Mabel, while you are away, there are none.  It makes me horribly dependent on you.  [_Enter_ LADY CHILTERN.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, dear!  How pretty you are looking!  MABEL CHILTERN.  How pale you are looking, Gertrude!  It is most becoming!  LADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, Lord Goring!  LORD GORING.  [_Bowing_.]  Good morning, Lady Chiltern!  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_Aside to_ LORD GORING.]  I shall be in the conservatory under the second palm tree on the left.  LORD GORING.  Second on the left?  MABEL CHILTERN.  [_With a look of mock surprise_.]  Yes; the usual palm tree.  [_Blows a kiss to him_, _unobserved by_ LADY CHILTERN, _and goes out_.]  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, I have a certain amount of very good news to tell you.  Mrs. Cheveley gave me up Robert's letter last night, and I burned it.  Robert is safe.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Sinking on the sofa_.]  Safe!  Oh! I am so glad of that.  What a good friend you are to him?to us!  LORD GORING.  There is only one person now that could be said to be in any danger.  LADY CHILTERN.  Who is that?  LORD GORING.  [_Sitting down beside her_.]  Yourself.  LADY CHILTERN.  I?  In danger?  What do you mean?  LORD GORING.  Danger is too great a word.  It is a word I should not have used.  But I admit I have something to tell you that may distress you, that terribly distresses me.  Yesterday evening you wrote me a very beautiful, womanly letter, asking me for my help.  You wrote to me as one of your oldest friends, one of your husband's oldest friends.  Mrs. Cheveley stole that letter from my rooms.  LADY CHILTERN.  Well, what use is it to her?  Why should she not have it?  LORD GORING.  [_Rising_.]  Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with you. Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband.  LADY CHILTERN.  But what construction could she put on it? . . . Oh! not that! not that!  If I in?in trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you, propose to come to you . . . that you may advise me . . . assist me . . . Oh! are there women so horrible as that . . .?  And she proposes to send it to my husband?  Tell me what happened.  Tell me all that happened.  LORD GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my library, without my knowledge.  I thought that the person who was waiting in that room to see me was yourself.  Robert came in unexpectedly.  A chair or something fell in the room.  He forced his way in, and he discovered her. We had a terrible scene.  I still thought it was you.  He left me in anger.  At the end of everything Mrs. Cheveley got possession of your letter'she stole it, when or how, I don?t know.  LADY CHILTERN.  At what hour did this happen?  LORD GORING.  At half-past ten.  And now I propose that we tell Robert the whole thing at once.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Looking at him with amazement that is almost terror_.] You want me to tell Robert that the woman you expected was not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself?  That it was I whom you thought was concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o?clock at night?  You want me to tell him that?  LORD GORING.  I think it is better that he should know the exact truth.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Rising_.]  Oh, I couldn?t, I couldn?t!  LORD GORING.  May I do it?  LADY CHILTERN.  No.  LORD GORING.  [_Gravely_.]  You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.  LADY CHILTERN.  No.  The letter must be intercepted.  That is all.  But how can I do it?  Letters arrive for him every moment of the day.  His secretaries open them and hand them to him.  I dare not ask the servants to bring me his letters.  It would be impossible.  Oh! why don?t you tell me what to do?  LORD GORING.  Pray be calm, Lady Chiltern, and answer the questions I am going to put to you.  You said his secretaries open his letters.  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  LORD GORING.  Who is with him to-day?  Mr. Trafford, isn?t it?  LADY CHILTERN.  No.  Mr. Montford, I think.  LORD GORING.  You can trust him?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  Oh! how do I know?  LORD GORING.  He would do what you asked him, wouldn?t he?  LADY CHILTERN.  I think so.  LORD GORING.  Your letter was on pink paper.  He could recognise it without reading it, couldn?t he?  By the colour?  LADY CHILTERN.  I suppose so.  LORD GORING.  Is he in the house now?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  LORD GORING.  Then I will go and see him myself, and tell him that a certain letter, written on pink paper, is to be forwarded to Robert to-day, and that at all costs it must not reach him.  [_Goes to the door_, _and opens it_.]  Oh! Robert is coming upstairs with the letter in his hand.  It has reached him already.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_With a cry of pain_.]  Oh! you have saved his life; what have you done with mine?  [_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  _He has the letter in his hand_, _and is reading it_.  _He comes towards his wife_, _not noticing_ LORD GORING?S _presence_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  ?I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you. Gertrude.?  Oh, my love!  Is this true?  Do you indeed trust me, and want me?  If so, it was for me to come to you, not for you to write of coming to me.  This letter of yours, Gertrude, makes me feel that nothing that the world may do can hurt me now.  You want me, Gertrude?  [LORD GORING, _unseen by_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, _makes an imploring sign to_ LADY CHILTERN _to accept the situation and_ SIR ROBERT?S _error_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You trust me, Gertrude?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! why did you not add you loved me?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Taking his hand_.]  Because I loved you.  [LORD GORING _passes into the conservatory_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Kisses her_.]  Gertrude, you don?t know what I feel.  When Montford passed me your letter across the table?he had opened it by mistake, I suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the envelope?and I read it?oh! I did not care what disgrace or punishment was in store for me, I only thought you loved me still.  LADY CHILTERN.  There is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public shame.  Mrs. Cheveley has handed over to Lord Goring the document that was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Are you sure of this, Gertrude?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to be safe!  For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How did Arthur destroy my letter?  Tell me.  LADY CHILTERN.  He burned it.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth burning to ashes.  How many men there are in modern life who would like to see their past burning to white ashes before them!  Is Arthur still here?  LADY CHILTERN.  Yes; he is in the conservatory.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad now I made that speech last night in the House, so glad.  I made it thinking that public disgrace might be the result.  But it has not been so.  LADY CHILTERN.  Public honour has been the result.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I think so.  I fear so, almost.  For although I am safe from detection, although every proof against me is destroyed, I suppose, Gertrude . . . I suppose I should retire from public life?  [_He looks anxiously at his wife_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Eagerly_.]  Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.  It is your duty to do that.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is much to surrender.  LADY CHILTERN.  No; it will be much to gain.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _walks up and down the room with a troubled expression_.  _Then comes over to his wife_, _and puts his hand on her shoulder_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And you would be happy living somewhere alone with me, abroad perhaps, or in the country away from London, away from public life?  You would have no regrets?  LADY CHILTERN.  Oh! none, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Sadly_.]  And your ambition for me?  You used to be ambitious for me.  LADY CHILTERN.  Oh, my ambition!  I have none now, but that we two may love each other.  It was your ambition that led you astray.  Let us not talk about ambition.  [LORD GORING _returns from the conservatory_, _looking very pleased with himself_, _and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one has made for him_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Going towards him_.]  Arthur, I have to thank you for what you have done for me.  I don?t know how I can repay you. [_Shakes hands with him_.]  LORD GORING.  My dear fellow, I?ll tell you at once.  At the present moment, under the usual palm tree . . . I mean in the conservatory . . .  [_Enter_ MASON.]  MASON.  Lord Caversham.  LORD GORING.  That admirable father of mine really makes a habit of turning up at the wrong moment.  It is very heartless of him, very heartless indeed.  [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.  MASON _goes out_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Good morning, Lady Chiltern!  Warmest congratulations to you, Chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.  I have just left the Prime Minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the Cabinet.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a look of joy and triumph_.]  A seat in the Cabinet?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Yes; here is the Prime Minister's letter.  [_Hands letter_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Takes letter and reads it_.]  A seat in the Cabinet!  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Certainly, and you well deserve it too.  You have got what we want so much in political life nowadays?high character, high moral tone, high principles.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Everything that you have not got, sir, and never will have.  LORD GORING.  I don?t like principles, father.  I prefer prejudices.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is on the brink of accepting the Prime Minister's offer_, _when he sees wife looking at him with her clear_, _candid eyes_. _He then realises that it is impossible_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I cannot accept this offer, Lord Caversham.  I have made up my mind to decline it.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Decline it, sir!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My intention is to retire at once from public life.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Angrily_.]  Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and retire from public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.  Chiltern, I beg your pardon.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Don?t grin like that, sir.  LORD GORING.  No, father.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.  Will you kindly prevent your husband from making such a . . . from taking such . . . Will you kindly do that, Lady Chiltern?  LADY CHILTERN.  I think my husband in right in his determination, Lord Caversham.  I approve of it.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  You approve of it?  Good heavens!  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Taking her husband's hand_.]  I admire him for it.  I admire him immensely for it.  I have never admired him so much before. He is finer than even I thought him.  [_To_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  You will go and write your letter to the Prime Minister now, won?t you? Don?t hesitate about it, Robert.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a touch of bitterness_.]  I suppose I had better write it at once.  Such offers are not repeated.  I will ask you to excuse me for a moment, Lord Caversham.  LADY CHILTERN.  I may come with you, Robert, may I not?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes, Gertrude.  [LADY CHILTERN _goes out with him_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What is the matter with this family?  Something wrong here, eh?  [_Tapping his forehead_.]  Idiocy?  Hereditary, I suppose. Both of them, too.  Wife as well as husband.  Very sad.  Very sad indeed! And they are not an old family.  Can?t understand it.  LORD GORING.  It is not idiocy, father, I assure you.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What is it then, sir?  LORD GORING.  [_After some hesitation_.]  Well, it is what is called nowadays a high moral tone, father.  That is all.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hate these new-fangled names.  Same thing as we used to call idiocy fifty years ago.  Shan?t stay in this house any longer.  LORD GORING.  [_Taking his arm_.]  Oh! just go in here for a moment, father.  Third palm tree to the left, the usual palm tree.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What, sir?  LORD GORING.  I beg your pardon, father, I forgot.  The conservatory, father, the conservatory?there is some one there I want you to talk to.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What about, sir?  LORD GORING.  About me, father,  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Grimly_.]  Not a subject on which much eloquence is possible.  LORD GORING.  No, father; but the lady is like me.  She doesn?t care much for eloquence in others.  She thinks it a little loud.  [LORD CAVERSHAM _goes out into the conservatory_.  LADY CHILTERN _enters_.]  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, why are you playing Mrs. Cheveley's cards?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Startled_.]  I don?t understand you.  LORD GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband.  Either to drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable position.  From the latter tragedy you saved him.  The former you are now thrusting on him.  Why should you do him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed?  LADY CHILTERN.  Lord Goring?  LORD GORING.  [_Pulling himself together for a great effort_, _and showing the philosopher that underlies the dandy_.]  Lady Chiltern, allow me.  You wrote me a letter last night in which you said you trusted me and wanted my help.  Now is the moment when you really want my help, now is the time when you have got to trust me, to trust in my counsel and judgment.  You love Robert.  Do you want to kill his love for you?  What sort of existence will he have if you rob him of the fruits of his ambition, if you take him from the splendour of a great political career, if you close the doors of public life against him, if you condemn him to sterile failure, he who was made for triumph and success?  Women are not meant to judge us, but to forgive us when we need forgiveness.  Pardon, not punishment, is their mission.  Why should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in his youth, before he knew you, before he knew himself? A man's life is of more value than a woman's.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  A woman's life revolves in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man's life progresses. Don?t make any terrible mistake, Lady Chiltern.  A woman who can keep a man's love, and love him in return, has done all the world wants of women, or should want of them.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Troubled and hesitating_.]  But it is my husband himself who wishes to retire from public life.  He feels it is his duty. It was he who first said so.  LORD GORING.  Rather than lose your love, Robert would do anything, wreck his whole career, as he is on the brink of doing now.  He is making for you a terrible sacrifice.  Take my advice, Lady Chiltern, and do not accept a sacrifice so great.  If you do, you will live to repent it bitterly.  We men and women are not made to accept such sacrifices from each other.  We are not worthy of them.  Besides, Robert has been punished enough.  LADY CHILTERN.  We have both been punished.  I set him up too high.  LORD GORING.  [_With deep feeling in his voice_.]  Do not for that reason set him down now too low.  If he has fallen from his altar, do not thrust him into the mire.  Failure to Robert would be the very mire of shame. Power is his passion.  He would lose everything, even his power to feel love.  Your husband's life is at this moment in your hands, your husband's love is in your hands.  Don?t mar both for him.  [_Enter_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, here is the draft of my letter.  Shall I read it to you?  LADY CHILTERN.  Let me see it.  [SIR ROBERT _hands her the letter_.  _She reads it_, _and then_, _with a gesture of passion_, _tears it up_.]  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What are you doing?  LADY CHILTERN.  A man's life is of more value than a woman's.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  Our lives revolve in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man's life progresses.  I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from Lord Goring.  And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!  Gertrude!  LADY CHILTERN.  You can forget.  Men easily forget.  And I forgive.  That is how women help the world.  I see that now.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Deeply overcome by emotion_, _embraces her_.]  My wife! my wife!  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Arthur, it seems that I am always to be in your debt.  LORD GORING.  Oh dear no, Robert.  Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not to me!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I owe you much.  And now tell me what you were going to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in.  LORD GORING.  Robert, you are your sister's guardian, and I want your consent to my marriage with her.  That is all.  LADY CHILTERN.  Oh, I am so glad!  I am so glad!  [_Shakes hands with_ LORD GORING.]  LORD GORING.  Thank you, Lady Chilte|2
58|rn.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_With a troubled look_.]  My sister to be your wife?  LORD GORING.  Yes.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Speaking with great firmness_.]  Arthur, I am very sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.  I have to think of Mabel's future happiness.  And I don?t think her happiness would be safe in your hands.  And I cannot have her sacrificed!  LORD GORING.  Sacrificed!  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes, utterly sacrificed.  Loveless marriages are horrible.  But there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage.  A marriage in which there is love, but on one side only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side only, and in which of the two hearts one is sure to be broken.  LORD GORING.  But I love Mabel.  No other woman has any place in my life.  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, if they love each other, why should they not be married?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur cannot bring Mabel the love that she deserves.  LORD GORING.  What reason have you for saying that?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_After a pause_.]  Do you really require me to tell you?  LORD GORING.  Certainly I do.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  As you choose.  When I called on you yesterday evening I found Mrs. Cheveley concealed in your rooms.  It was between ten and eleven o?clock at night.  I do not wish to say anything more. Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, as I said to you last night, nothing whatsoever to do with me.  I know you were engaged to be married to her once.  The fascination she exercised over you then seems to have returned.  You spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured.  That may be so.  But I cannot give my sister's life into your hands.  It would be wrong of me. It would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.  LORD GORING.  I have nothing more to say.  LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it was not Mrs. Cheveley whom Lord Goring expected last night.  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Not Mrs. Cheveley!  Who was it then?  LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern!  LADY CHILTERN.  It was your own wife.  Robert, yesterday afternoon Lord Goring told me that if ever I was in trouble I could come to him for help, as he was our oldest and best friend.  Later on, after that terrible scene in this room, I wrote to him telling him that I trusted him, that I had need of him, that I was coming to him for help and advice.  [SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _takes the letter out of his pocket_.] Yes, that letter.  I didn?t go to Lord Goring's, after all.  I felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can come.  Pride made me think that. Mrs. Cheveley went.  She stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you this morning, that you should think . . . Oh! Robert, I cannot tell you what she wished you to think. . . .  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What!  Had I fallen so low in your eyes that you thought that even for a moment I could have doubted your goodness? Gertrude, Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and sin can never touch you.  Arthur, you can go to Mabel, and you have my best wishes!  Oh! stop a moment.  There is no name at the beginning of this letter.  The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does not seem to have noticed that.  There should be a name.  LADY CHILTERN.  Let me write yours.  It is you I trust and need.  You and none else.  LORD GORING.  Well, really, Lady Chiltern, I think I should have back my own letter.  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Smiling_.]  No; you shall have Mabel.  [_Takes the letter and writes her husband's name on it_.]  LORD GORING.  Well, I hope she hasn?t changed her mind.  It's nearly twenty minutes since I saw her last.  [_Enter_ MABEL CHILTERN _and_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, I think your father's conversation much more improving than yours.  I am only going to talk to Lord Caversham in the future, and always under the usual palm tree.  LORD GORING.  Darling!  [_Kisses her_.]  LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Considerably taken aback_.]  What does this mean, sir? You don?t mean to say that this charming, clever young lady has been so foolish as to accept you?  LORD GORING.  Certainly, father!  And Chiltern's been wise enough to accept the seat in the Cabinet.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  I am very glad to hear that, Chiltern . . . I congratulate you, sir.  If the country doesn?t go to the dogs or the Radicals, we shall have you Prime Minister, some day.  [_Enter_ MASON.]  MASON.  Luncheon is on the table, my Lady!  [MASON _goes out_.]  MABEL CHILTERN.  You?ll stop to luncheon, Lord Caversham, won?t you?  LORD CAVERSHAM.  With pleasure, and I?ll drive you down to Downing Street afterwards, Chiltern.  You have a great future before you, a great future.  Wish I could say the same for you, sir.  [_To_ LORD GORING.] But your career will have to be entirely domestic.  LORD GORING.  Yes, father, I prefer it domestic.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  And if you don?t make this young lady an ideal husband, I?ll cut you off with a shilling.  MABEL CHILTERN.  An ideal husband!  Oh, I don?t think I should like that. It sounds like something in the next world.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  What do you want him to be then, dear?  MABEL CHILTERN.  He can be what he chooses.  All I want is to be . . . to be . . . oh! a real wife to him.  LORD CAVERSHAM.  Upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in that, Lady Chiltern.  [_They all go out except_ SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  _He sinks in a chair_, _wrapt in thought_.  _After a little time_ LADY CHILTERN _returns to look for him_.]  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Leaning over the back of the chair_.]  Aren?t you coming in, Robert?  SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [_Taking her hand_.]  Gertrude, is it love you feel for me, or is it pity merely?  LADY CHILTERN.  [_Kisses him_.]  It is love, Robert.  Love, and only love.  For both of us a new life is beginning.  THE DECAY OF LYING: AN OBSERVATION  CYRIL (_coming in through the open window from the terrace_).  My dear Vivian, don?t coop yourself up all day in the library.  It is a perfectly lovely afternoon.  The air is exquisite.  There is a mist upon the woods, like the purple bloom upon a plum.  Let us go and lie on the grass and smoke cigarettes and enjoy Nature.  VIVIAN.  Enjoy Nature!  I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty.  People tell us that Art makes us love Nature more than we loved her before; that it reveals her secrets to us; and that after a careful study of Corot and Constable we see things in her that had escaped our observation.  My own experience is that the more we study Art, the less we care for Nature.  What Art really reveals to us is Nature's lack of design, her curious crudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinished condition.  Nature has good intentions, of course, but, as Aristotle once said, she cannot carry them out.  When I look at a landscape I cannot help seeing all its defects.  It is fortunate for us, however, that Nature is so imperfect, as otherwise we should have no art at all.  Art is our spirited protest, our gallant attempt to teach Nature her proper place.  As for the infinite variety of Nature, that is a pure myth.  It is not to be found in Nature herself.  It resides in the imagination, or fancy, or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her.  CYRIL.  Well, you need not look at the landscape.  You can lie on the grass and smoke and talk.  VIVIAN.  But Nature is so uncomfortable.  Grass is hard and lumpy and damp, and full of dreadful black insects.  Why, even Morris's poorest workman could make you a more comfortable seat than the whole of Nature can.  Nature pales before the furniture of ?the street which from Oxford has borrowed its name,? as the poet you love so much once vilely phrased it.  I don?t complain.  If Nature had been comfortable, mankind would never have invented architecture, and I prefer houses to the open air. In a house we all feel of the proper proportions.  Everything is subordinated to us, fashioned for our use and our pleasure.  Egotism itself, which is so necessary to a proper sense of human dignity, is entirely the result of indoor life.  Out of doors one becomes abstract and impersonal.  One's individuality absolutely leaves one.  And then Nature is so indifferent, so unappreciative.  Whenever I am walking in the park here, I always feel that I am no more to her than the cattle that browse on the slope, or the burdock that blooms in the ditch. Nothing is more evident than that Nature hates Mind.  Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people die of it just as they die of any other disease.  Fortunately, in England at any rate, thought is not catching.  Our splendid physique as a people is entirely due to our national stupidity.  I only hope we shall be able to keep this great historic bulwark of our happiness for many years to come; but I am afraid that we are beginning to be over-educated; at least everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching?that is really what our enthusiasm for education has come to.  In the meantime, you had better go back to your wearisome uncomfortable Nature, and leave me to correct my proofs.  CYRIL.  Writing an article!  That is not very consistent after what you have just said.  VIVIAN.  Who wants to be consistent?  The dullard and the doctrinaire, the tedious people who carry out their principles to the bitter end of action, to the _reductio ad absurdum_ of practice.  Not I.  Like Emerson, I write over the door of my library the word ?Whim.?  Besides, my article is really a most salutary and valuable warning.  If it is attended to, there may be a new Renaissance of Art.  CYRIL.  What is the subject?  VIVIAN.  I intend to call it ?The Decay of Lying: A Protest.?  CYRIL.  Lying!  I should have thought that our politicians kept up that habit.  VIVIAN.  I assure you that they do not.  They never rise beyond the level of misrepresentation, and actually condescend to prove, to discuss, to argue.  How different from the temper of the true liar, with his frank, fearless statements, his superb irresponsibility, his healthy, natural disdain of proof of any kind!  After all, what is a fine lie?  Simply that which is its own evidence.  If a man is sufficiently unimaginative to produce evidence in support of a lie, he might just as well speak the truth at once.  No, the politicians won?t do.  Something may, perhaps, be urged on behalf of the Bar.  The mantle of the Sophist has fallen on its members.  Their feigned ardours and unreal rhetoric are delightful.  They can make the worse appear the better cause, as though they were fresh from Leontine schools, and have been known to wrest from reluctant juries triumphant verdicts of acquittal for their clients, even when those clients, as often happens, were clearly and unmistakeably innocent.  But they are briefed by the prosaic, and are not ashamed to appeal to precedent.  In spite of their endeavours, the truth will out. Newspapers, even, have degenerated.  They may now be absolutely relied upon.  One feels it as one wades through their columns.  It is always the unreadable that occurs.  I am afraid that there is not much to be said in favour of either the lawyer or the journalist.  Besides, what I am pleading for is Lying in art.  Shall I read you what I have written?  It might do you a great deal of good.  CYRIL.  Certainly, if you give me a cigarette.  Thanks.  By the way, what magazine do you intend it for?  VIVIAN.  For the _Retrospective Review_.  I think I told you that the elect had revived it.  CYRIL.  Whom do you mean by ?the elect??  VIVIAN.  Oh, The Tired Hedonists, of course.  It is a club to which I belong.  We are supposed to wear faded roses in our button-holes when we meet, and to have a sort of cult for Domitian.  I am afraid you are not eligible.  You are too fond of simple pleasures.  CYRIL.  I should be black-balled on the ground of animal spirits, I suppose?  VIVIAN.  Probably.  Besides, you are a little too old.  We don?t admit anybody who is of the usual age.  CYRIL.  Well, I should fancy you are all a good deal bored with each other.  VIVIAN.  We are.  This is one of the objects of the club.  Now, if you promise not to interrupt too often, I will read you my article.  CYRIL.  You will find me all attention.  VIVIAN (_reading in a very clear_, _musical voice_).  THE DECAY OF LYING: A PROTEST.?One of the chief causes that can be assigned for the curiously commonplace character of most of the literature of our age is undoubtedly the decay of Lying as an art, a science, and a social pleasure.  The ancient historians gave us delightful fiction in the form of fact; the modern novelist presents us with dull facts under the guise of fiction. The Blue-Book is rapidly becoming his ideal both for method and manner. He has his tedious _document humain_, his miserable little _coin de la cr?ation_, into which he peers with his microscope.  He is to be found at the Librairie Nationale, or at the British Museum, shamelessly reading up his subject.  He has not even the courage of other people's ideas, but insists on going directly to life for everything, and ultimately, between encyclop?dias and personal experience, he comes to the ground, having drawn his types from the family circle or from the weekly washerwoman, and having acquired an amount of useful information from which never, even in his most meditative moments, can he thoroughly free himself.  ?The lose that results to literature in general from this false ideal of our time can hardly be overestimated.  People have a careless way of talking about a ?born liar,? just as they talk about a ?born poet.?  But in both cases they are wrong.  Lying and poetry are arts?arts, as Pinto saw, not unconnected with each other?and they require the most careful study, the most disinterested devotion.  Indeed, they have their technique, just as the more material arts of painting and sculpture have, their subtle secrets of form and colour, their craft-mysteries, their deliberate artistic methods.  As one knows the poet by his fine music, so one can recognise the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance, and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice.  Here, as elsewhere, practice must, precede perfection.  But in modern days while the fashion of writing poetry has become far too common, and should, if possible, be discouraged, the fashion of lying has almost fallen into disrepute.  Many a young man starts in life with a natural gift for exaggeration which, if nurtured in congenial and sympathetic surroundings, or by the imitation of the best models, might grow into something really great and wonderful.  But, as a rule, he comes to nothing.  He either falls into careless habits of accuracy??  CYRIL.  My dear fellow!  VIVIAN.  Please don?t interrupt in the middle of a sentence.  ?He either falls into careless habits of accuracy, or takes to frequenting the society of the aged and the well-informed.  Both things are equally fatal to his imagination, as indeed they would be fatal to the imagination of anybody, and in a short time he develops a morbid and unhealthy faculty of truth-telling, begins to verify all statements made in his presence, has no hesitation in contradicting people who are much younger than himself, and often ends by writing novels which are so lifelike that no one can possibly believe in their probability.  This is no isolated instance that we are giving.  It is simply one example out of many; and if something cannot be done to check, or at least to modify, our monstrous worship of facts, Art will become sterile, and beauty will pass away from the land.  ?Even Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, that delightful master of delicate and fanciful prose, is tainted with this modern vice, for we know positively no other name for it.  There is such a thing as robbing a story of its reality by trying to make it too true, and _The Black Arrow_ is so inartistic as not to contain a single anachronism to boast of, while the transformation of Dr. Jekyll reads dangerously like an experiment out of the _Lancet_.  As for Mr. Rider Haggard, who really has, or had once, the makings of a perfectly magnificent liar, he is now so afraid of being suspected of genius that when he does tell us anything marvellous, he feels bound to invent a personal reminiscence, and to put it into a footnote as a kind of cowardly corroboration.  Nor are our other novelists much better.  Mr. Henry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty, and wastes upon mean motives and imperceptible ?points of view? his neat literary style, his felicitous phrases, his swift and caustic satire.  Mr. Hall Caine, it is true, aims at the grandiose, but then he writes at the top of his voice.  He is so loud that one cannot bear what he says.  Mr. James Payn is an adept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding.  He hunts down the obvious with the enthusiasm of a short-sighted detective.  As one turns over the pages, the suspense of the author becomes almost unbearable.  The horses of Mr. William Black's phaeton do not soar towards the sun.  They merely frighten the sky at evening into violent chromolithographic effects.  On seeing them approach, the peasants take refuge in dialect.  Mrs. Oliphant prattles pleasantly about curates, lawn-tennis parties, domesticity, and other wearisome things.  Mr. Marion Crawford has immolated himself upon the altar of local colour.  He is like the lady in the French comedy who keeps talking about ?le beau ciel d?Italie.?  Besides, he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral platitudes.  He is always telling us that to be good is to be good, and that to be bad is to be wicked.  At times he is almost edifying.  _Robert Elsmere_ is of course a masterpiece?a masterpiece of the ?genre ennuyeux,? the one form of literature that the English people seems thoroughly to enjoy.  A thoughtful young friend of ours once told us that it reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on at a meat tea in the house of a serious Nonconformist family, and we can quite believe it.  Indeed it is only in England that such a book could be produced.  England is the home of lost ideas.  As for that great and daily increasing school of novelists for whom the sun always rises in the East-End, the only thing that can be said about them is that they find life crude, and leave it raw.  ?In France, though nothing so deliberately tedious as _Robert Elsmere_ has been produced, things are not much better.  M. Guy de Maupassant, with his keen mordant irony and his hard vivid style, strips life of the few poor rags that still cover her, and shows us foul sore and festering wound.  He writes lurid little tragedies in which everybody is ridiculous; bitter comedies at which one cannot laugh for very tears.  M. Zola, true to the lofty principle that he lays down in one of his pronunciamientos on literature, ?L?homme de g?nie n?a jamais d?esprit,? is determined to show that, if he has not got genius, he can at least be dull.  And how well he succeeds!  He is not without power.  Indeed at times, as in _Germinal_, there is something almost epic in his work.  But his work is entirely wrong from beginning to end, and wrong not on the ground of morals, but on the ground of art.  From any ethical standpoint it is just what it should be.  The author is perfectly truthful, and describes things exactly as they happen.  What more can any moralist desire?  We have no sympathy at all with the moral indignation of our time against M. Zola.  It is simply the indignation of Tartuffe on being exposed.  But from the standpoint of art, what can be said in favour of the author of _L?Assommoir_, _Nana_ and _Pot-Bouille_?  Nothing.  Mr. Ruskin once described the characters in George Eliot's novels as being like the sweepings of a Pentonville omnibus, but M. Zola's characters are much worse.  They have their dreary vices, and their drearier virtues. The record of their lives is absolutely without interest.  Who cares what happens to them?  In literature we require distinction, charm, beauty and imaginative power.  We don?t want to be harrowed and disgusted with an account of the doings of the lower orders.  M. Daudet is better.  He has wit, a light touch and an amusing style.  But he has lately committed literary suicide.  Nobody can possibly care for Delobelle with his ?Il faut lutter pour l?art,? or for Valmajour with his eternal refrain about the nightingale, or for the poet in _Jack_ with his ?mots cruels,? now that we have learned from _Vingt Ans de ma Vie litt?raire_ that these characters were taken directly from life.  To us they seem to have suddenly lost all their vitality, all the few qualities they ever possessed.  The only real people are the people who never existed, and if a novelist is base enough to go to life for his personages he should at least pretend that they are creations, and not boast of them as copies. The justification of a character in a novel is not that other persons are what they are, but that the author is what he is.  Otherwise the novel is not a work of art.  As for M. Paul Bourget, the master of the _roman psychologique_, he commits the error of imagining that the men and women of modern life are capable of being infinitely analysed for an innumerable series of chapters.  In point of fact what is interesting about people in good society?and M. Bourget rarely moves out of the Faubourg St. Germain, except to come to London,?is the mask that each one of them wears, not the reality that lies behind the mask.  It is a humiliating confession, but we are all of us made out of the same stuff. In Falstaff there is something of Hamlet, in Hamlet there is not a little of Falstaff.  The fat knight has his moods of melancholy, and the young prince his moments of coarse humour.  Where we differ from each other is purely in accidentals: in dress, manner, tone of voice, religious opinions, personal appearance, tricks of habit and the like.  The more one analyses people, the more all reasons for analysis disappear.  Sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universal thing called human nature. Indeed, as any one who has ever worked among the poor knows only too well, the brotherhood of man is no mere poet's dream, it is a most depressing and humiliating reality; and if a writer insists upon analysing the upper classes, he might just as well write of match-girls and costermongers at once.?  However, my dear Cyril, I will not detain you any further just here.  I quite admit that modern novels have many good points.  All I insist on is that, as a class, they are quite unreadable.  CYRIL.  That is certainly a very grave qualification, but I must say that I think you are rather unfair in some of your strictures.  I like _The Deemster_, and _The Daughter of Heth_, and _Le Disciple_, and _Mr. Isaacs_, and as for _Robert Elsmere_, I am quite devoted to it.  Not that I can look upon it as a serious work.  As a statement of the problems that confront the earnest Christian it is ridiculous and antiquated.  It is simply Arnold's _Literature and Dogma_ with the literature left out. It is as much behind the age as Paley's _Evidences_, or Colenso's method of Biblical exegesis.  Nor could anything be less impressive than the unfortunate hero gravely heralding a dawn that rose long ago, and so completely missing its true significance that he proposes to carry on the business of the old firm under the new name.  On the other hand, it contains several clever caricatures, and a heap of delightful quotations, and Green's philosophy very pleasantly sugars the somewhat bitter pill of the author's fiction.  I also cannot help expressing my surprise that you have said nothing about the two novelists whom you are always reading, Balzac and George Meredith.  Surely they are realists, both of them?  VIVIAN.  Ah!  Meredith!  Who can define him?  His style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning.  As a writer he has mastered everything except language: as a novelist he can do everything, except tell a story: as an artist he is everything except articulate.  Somebody in Shakespeare?Touchstone, I think?talks about a man who is always breaking his shins over his own wit, and it seems to me that this might serve as the basis for a criticism of Meredith's method.  But whatever he is, he is not a realist.  Or rather I would say that he is a child of realism who is not on speaking terms with his father.  By deliberate choice he has made himself a romanticist.  He has refused to bow the knee to Baal, and after all, even if the man's fine spirit did not revolt against the noisy assertions of realism, his style would be quite sufficient of itself to keep life at a respectful distance.  By its means he has planted round his garden a hedge full of thorns, and red with wonderful roses.  As for Balzac, he was a most remarkable combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit.  The latter he bequeathed to his disciples.  The former was entirely his own.  The difference between such a book as M. Zola's _L?Assommoir_ and Balzac's _Illusions Perdues_ is the difference between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality.  ?All Balzac's characters;? said Baudelaire, ?are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself.  All his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams.  Each mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will.  The very scullions have genius.?  A steady course of Balzac reduces our living friends to shadows, and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades.  His characters have a kind of fervent fiery-coloured existence.  They dominate us, and defy scepticism. One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the death of Lucien de Rubempr?.  It is a grief from which I have never been able completely to rid myself.  It haunts me in my moments of pleasure.  I remember it when I laugh.  But Balzac is no more a realist than Holbein was.  He created life, he did not copy it.  I admit, however, that he set far too high a value on modernity of form, and that, consequently, there is no book of his that, as an artistic masterpiece, can rank with _Salammb?_ or _Esmond_, or _The Cloister and the Hearth_, or the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_.  CYRIL.  Do you object to modernity of form, then?  VIVIAN.  Yes.  It is a huge price to pay for a very poor result.  Pure modernity of form is always somewhat vulgarising.  It cannot help being so.  The public imagine that, because they are interested in their immediate surroundings, Art should be interested in them also, and should take them as her subject-matter.  But the mere fact that they are interested in these things makes them unsuitable subjects for Art.  The only beautiful things, as somebody once said, are the things that do not concern us.  As long as a thing is useful or necessary to us, or affects us in any way, either for pain or for pleasure, or appeals strongly to our sympathies, or is a vital part of the environment in which we live, it is outside the proper sphere of art.  To art's subject-matter we should be more or less indifferent.  We should, at any rate, have no preferences, no prejudices, no partisan feeling of any kind.  It is exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are such an admirable motive for a tragedy.  I do not know anything in the whole history of literature sadder than the artistic career of Charles Reade. He wrote one beautiful book, _The Cloister and the Hearth_, a book as much above _Romola_ as _Romola_ is above _Daniel Deronda_, and wasted the rest of his life in a foolish attempt to be modern, to draw public attention to the state of our convict prisons, and the management of our private lunatic asylums.  Charles Dickens was depressing enough in all conscience when he tried to arouse our sympathy for the victims of the poor-law administration; but Charles Reade, an artist, a scholar, a man with a true sense of beauty, raging and roaring over the abuses of contemporary life like a common pamphleteer or a sensational journalist, is really a sight for the angels to weep over.  Believe me, my dear Cyril, modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter are entirely and absolutely wrong.  We have mistaken the common livery of the age for the vesture of the Muses, and spend our days in the sordid streets and hideous suburbs of our vile cities when we should be out on the hillside with Apollo.  Certainly we are a degraded race, and have sold our birthright for a mess of facts.  CYRIL.  There is something in what you say, and there is no doubt|2
59| that whatever amusement we may find in reading a purely model novel, we have rarely any artistic pleasure in re-reading it.  And this is perhaps the best rough test of what is literature and what is not.  If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use reading it at all.  But what do you say about the return to Life and Nature?  This is the panacea that is always being recommended to us.  VIVIAN.  I will read you what I say on that subject.  The passage comes later on in the article, but I may as well give it to you now:?  ?The popular cry of our time is ?Let us return to Life and Nature; they will recreate Art for us, and send the red blood coursing through her veins; they will shoe her feet with swiftness and make her hand strong.? But, alas! we are mistaken in our amiable and well-meaning efforts. Nature is always behind the age.  And as for Life, she is the solvent that breaks up Art, the enemy that lays waste her house.?  CYRIL.  What do you mean by saying that Nature is always behind the age?  VIVIAN.  Well, perhaps that is rather cryptic.  What I mean is this.  If we take Nature to mean natural simple instinct as opposed to self-conscious culture, the work produced under this influence is always old-fashioned, antiquated, and out of date.  One touch of Nature may make the whole world kin, but two touches of Nature will destroy any work of Art.  If, on the other hand, we regard Nature as the collection of phenomena external to man, people only discover in her what they bring to her.  She has no suggestions of her own.  Wordsworth went to the lakes, but he was never a lake poet.  He found in stones the sermons he had already hidden there.  He went moralising about the district, but his good work was produced when he returned, not to Nature but to poetry. Poetry gave him ?Laodamia,? and the fine sonnets, and the great Ode, such as it is.  Nature gave him ?Martha Ray? and ?Peter Bell,? and the address to Mr. Wilkinson's spade.  CYRIL.  I think that view might be questioned.  I am rather inclined to believe in ?the impulse from a vernal wood,? though of course the artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely on the kind of temperament that receives it, so that the return to Nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great personality.  You would agree with that, I fancy.  However, proceed with your article.  VIVIAN (_reading_).  ?Art begins with abstract decoration, with purely imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unreal and non-existent.  This is the first stage.  Then Life becomes fascinated with this new wonder, and asks to be admitted into the charmed circle. Art takes life as part of her rough material, recreates it, and refashions it in fresh forms, is absolutely indifferent to fact, invents, imagines, dreams, and keeps between herself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style, of decorative or ideal treatment.  The third stage is when Life gets the upper hand, and drives Art out into the wilderness.  That is the true decadence, and it is from this that we are now suffering.  ?Take the case of the English drama.  At first in the hands of the monks Dramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological.  Then she enlisted Life in her service, and using some of life's external forms, she created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrows were more terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joys were keener than lover's joys, who had the rage of the Titans and the calm of the gods, who had monstrous and marvellous sins, monstrous and marvellous virtues. To them she gave a language different from that of actual use, a language full of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence, or made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, and enriched with lofty diction.  She clothed her children in strange raiment and gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique world rose from its marble tomb.  A new C'sar stalked through the streets of risen Rome, and with purple sail and flute-led oars another Cleopatra passed up the river to Antioch.  Old myth and legend and dream took shape and substance. History was entirely re-written, and there was hardly one of the dramatists who did not recognise that the object of Art is not simple truth but complex beauty.  In this they were perfectly right.  Art itself is really a form of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit of art, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis.  ?But Life soon shattered the perfection of the form.  Even in Shakespeare we can see the beginning of the end.  It shows itself by the gradual breaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays, by the predominance given to prose, and by the over-importance assigned to characterisation. The passages in Shakespeare?and they are many?where the language is uncouth, vulgar, exaggerated, fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due to Life calling for an echo of her own voice, and rejecting the intervention of beautiful style, through which alone should life be suffered to find expression.  Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless artist.  He is too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life's natural utterance.  He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginative medium she surrenders everything.  Goethe says, somewhere?      In der Beschr?nkung zeigt Fsich erst der Meister,  ?It is in working within limits that the master reveals himself,? and the limitation, the very condition of any art is style.  However, we need not linger any longer over Shakespeare's realism.  _The Tempest_ is the most perfect of palinodes.  All that we desired to point out was, that the magnificent work of the Elizabethan and Jacobean artists contained within itself the seeds of its own dissolution, and that, if it drew some of its strength from using life as rough material, it drew all its weakness from using life as an artistic method.  As the inevitable result of this substitution of an imitative for a creative medium, this surrender of an imaginative form, we have the modern English melodrama.  The characters in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they would talk off it; they have neither aspirations nor aspirates; they are taken directly from life and reproduce its vulgarity down to the smallest detail; they present the gait, manner, costume and accent of real people; they would pass unnoticed in a third-class railway carriage.  And yet how wearisome the plays are!  They do not succeed in producing even that impression of reality at which they aim, and which is their only reason for existing. As a method, realism is a complete failure.  ?What is true about the drama and the novel is no less true about those arts that we call the decorative arts.  The whole history of these arts in Europe is the record of the struggle between Orientalism, with its frank rejection of imitation, its love of artistic convention, its dislike to the actual representation of any object in Nature, and our own imitative spirit.  Wherever the former has been paramount, as in Byzantium, Sicily and Spain, by actual contact, or in the rest of Europe by the influence of the Crusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative work in which the visible things of life are transmuted into artistic conventions, and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned for her delight.  But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, our work has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting.  Modern tapestry, with its a?rial effects, its elaborate perspective, its broad expanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism, has no beauty whatsoever.  The pictorial glass of Germany is absolutely detestable.  We are beginning to weave possible carpets in England, but only because we have returned to the method and spirit of the East.  Our rugs and carpets of twenty years ago, with their solemn depressing truths, their inane worship of Nature, their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have become, even to the Philistine, a source of laughter.  A cultured Mahomedan once remarked to us, ?You Christians are so occupied in misinterpreting the fourth commandment that you have never thought of making an artistic application of the second.?  He was perfectly right, and the whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learn art in is not Life but Art.?  And now let me read you a passage which seems to me to settle the question very completely.  ?It was not always thus.  We need not say anything about the poets, for they, with the unfortunate exception of Mr. Wordsworth, have been really faithful to their high mission, and are universally recognised as being absolutely unreliable.  But in the works of Herodotus, who, in spite of the shallow and ungenerous attempts of modern sciolists to verify his history, may justly be called the ?Father of Lies?; in the published speeches of Cicero and the biographies of Suetonius; in Tacitus at his best; in Pliny's _Natural History_; in Hanno's _Periplus_; in all the early chronicles; in the Lives of the Saints; in Froissart and Sir Thomas Malory; in the travels of Marco Polo; in Olaus Magnus, and Aldrovandus, and Conrad Lycosthenes, with his magnificent _Prodigiorum et Ostentorum Chronicon_; in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini; in the memoirs of Casanova; in Defoe's _History of the Plague_; in Boswell's _Life of Johnson_; in Napoleon's despatches, and in the works of our own Carlyle, whose _French Revolution_ is one of the most fascinating historical novels ever written, facts are either kept in their proper subordinate position, or else entirely excluded on the general ground of dulness. Now, everything is changed.  Facts are not merely finding a footing-place in history, but they are usurping the domain of Fancy, and have invaded the kingdom of Romance.  Their chilling touch is over everything.  They are vulgarising mankind.  The crude commercialism of America, its materialising spirit, its indifference to the poetical side of things, and its lack of imagination and of high unattainable ideals, are entirely due to that country having adopted for its national hero a man who, according to his own confession, was incapable of telling a lie, and it is not too much to say that the story of George Washington and the cherry-tree has done more harm, and in a shorter space of time, than any other moral tale in the whole of literature.?  CYRIL.  My dear boy!  VIVIAN.  I assure you it is the case, and the amusing part of the whole thing is that the story of the cherry-tree is an absolute myth.  However, you must not think that I am too despondent about the artistic future either of America or of our own country.  Listen to this:?  ?That some change will take place before this century has drawn to its close we have no doubt whatsoever.  Bored by the tedious and improving conversation of those who have neither the wit to exaggerate nor the genius to romance, tired of the intelligent person whose reminiscences are always based upon memory, whose statements are invariably limited by probability, and who is at any time liable to be corroborated by the merest Philistine who happens to be present, Society sooner or later must return to its lost leader, the cultured and fascinating liar.  Who he was who first, without ever having gone out to the rude chase, told the wandering cavemen at sunset how he had dragged the Megatherium from the purple darkness of its jasper cave, or slain the Mammoth in single combat and brought back its gilded tusks, we cannot tell, and not one of our modern anthropologists, for all their much-boasted science, has had the ordinary courage to tell us.  Whatever was his name or race, he certainly was the true founder of social intercourse.  For the aim of the liar is simply to charm, to delight, to give pleasure.  He is the very basis of civilised society, and without him a dinner-party, even at the mansions of the great, is as dull as a lecture at the Royal Society, or a debate at the Incorporated Authors, or one of Mr. Burnand's farcical comedies.  ?Nor will he be welcomed by society alone.  Art, breaking from the prison-house of realism, will run to greet him, and will kiss his false, beautiful lips, knowing that he alone is in possession of the great secret of all her manifestations, the secret that Truth is entirely and absolutely a matter of style; while Life?poor, probable, uninteresting human life?tired of repeating herself for the benefit of Mr. Herbert Spencer, scientific historians, and the compilers of statistics in general, will follow meekly after him, and try to reproduce, in her own simple and untutored way, some of the marvels of which he talks.  ?No doubt there will always be critics who, like a certain writer in the _Saturday Review_, will gravely censure the teller of fairy tales for his defective knowledge of natural history, who will measure imaginative work by their own lack of any imaginative faculty, and will hold up their ink-stained hands in horror if some honest gentleman, who has never been farther than the yew-trees of his own garden, pens a fascinating book of travels like Sir John Mandeville, or, like great Raleigh, writes a whole history of the world, without knowing anything whatsoever about the past. To excuse themselves they will try and shelter under the shield of him who made Prospero the magician, and gave him Caliban and Ariel as his servants, who heard the Tritons blowing their horns round the coral reefs of the Enchanted Isle, and the fairies singing to each other in a wood near Athens, who led the phantom kings in dim procession across the misty Scottish heath, and hid Hecate in a cave with the weird sisters.  They will call upon Shakespeare?they always do?and will quote that hackneyed passage forgetting that this unfortunate aphorism about Art holding the mirror up to Nature, is deliberately said by Hamlet in order to convince the bystanders of his absolute insanity in all art-matters.?  CYRIL.  Ahem!  Another cigarette, please.  VIVIAN.  My dear fellow, whatever you may say, it is merely a dramatic utterance, and no more represents Shakespeare's real views upon art than the speeches of Iago represent his real views upon morals.  But let me get to the end of the passage:  ?Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself.  She is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance.  She is a veil, rather than a mirror.  She has flowers that no forests know of, birds that no woodland possesses.  She makes and unmakes many worlds, and can draw the moon from heaven with a scarlet thread.  Hers are the ?forms more real than living man,? and hers the great archetypes of which things that have existence are but unfinished copies.  Nature has, in her eyes, no laws, no uniformity.  She can work miracles at her will, and when she calls monsters from the deep they come.  She can bid the almond-tree blossom in winter, and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield.  At her word the frost lays its silver finger on the burning mouth of June, and the winged lions creep out from the hollows of the Lydian hills.  The dryads peer from the thicket as she passes by, and the brown fauns smile strangely at her when she comes near them.  She has hawk-faced gods that worship her, and the centaurs gallop at her side.?  CYRIL.  I like that.  I can see it.  Is that the end?  VIVIAN.  No.  There is one more passage, but it is purely practical.  It simply suggests some methods by which we could revive this lost art of Lying.  CYRIL.  Well, before you read it to me, I should like to ask you a question.  What do you mean by saying that life, ?poor, probable, uninteresting human life,? will try to reproduce the marvels of art?  I can quite understand your objection to art being treated as a mirror. You think it would reduce genius to the position of a cracked looking-glass.  But you don?t mean to say that you seriously believe that Life imitates Art, that Life in fact is the mirror, and Art the reality?  VIVIAN.  Certainly I do.  Paradox though it may seem?and paradoxes are always dangerous things?it is none the less true that Life imitates art far more than Art imitates life.  We have all seen in our own day in England how a certain curious and fascinating type of beauty, invented and emphasised by two imaginative painters, has so influenced Life that whenever one goes to a private view or to an artistic salon one sees, here the mystic eyes of Rossetti's dream, the long ivory throat, the strange square-cut jaw, the loosened shadowy hair that he so ardently loved, there the sweet maidenhood of ?The Golden Stair,? the blossom-like mouth and weary loveliness of the ?Laus Amoris,? the passion-pale face of Andromeda, the thin hands and lithe beauty of the Vivian in ?Merlin's Dream.?  And it has always been so.  A great artist invents a type, and Life tries to copy it, to reproduce it in a popular form, like an enterprising publisher.  Neither Holbein nor Vandyck found in England what they have given us.  They brought their types with them, and Life with her keen imitative faculty set herself to supply the master with models.  The Greeks, with their quick artistic instinct, understood this, and set in the bride's chamber the statue of Hermes or of Apollo, that she might bear children as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in her rapture or her pain.  They knew that Life gains from art not merely spirituality, depth of thought and feeling, soul-turmoil or soul-peace, but that she can form herself on the very lines and colours of art, and can reproduce the dignity of Pheidias as well as the grace of Praxiteles.  Hence came their objection to realism.  They disliked it on purely social grounds.  They felt that it inevitably makes people ugly, and they were perfectly right.  We try to improve the conditions of the race by means of good air, free sunlight, wholesome water, and hideous bare buildings for the better housing of the lower orders.  But these things merely produce health, they do not produce beauty.  For this, Art is required, and the true disciples of the great artist are not his studio-imitators, but those who become like his works of art, be they plastic as in Greek days, or pictorial as in modern times; in a word, Life is Art's best, Art's only pupil.  As it is with the visible arts, so it is with literature.  The most obvious and the vulgarest form in which this is shown is in the case of the silly boys who, after reading the adventures of Jack Sheppard or Dick Turpin, pillage the stalls of unfortunate apple-women, break into sweet-shops at night, and alarm old gentlemen who are returning home from the city by leaping out on them in suburban lanes, with black masks and unloaded revolvers.  This interesting phenomenon, which always occurs after the appearance of a new edition of either of the books I have alluded to, is usually attributed to the influence of literature on the imagination.  But this is a mistake.  The imagination is essentially creative, and always seeks for a new form.  The boy-burglar is simply the inevitable result of life's imitative instinct.  He is Fact, occupied as Fact usually is, with trying to reproduce Fiction, and what we see in him is repeated on an extended scale throughout the whole of life. Schopenhauer has analysed the pessimism that characterises modern thought, but Hamlet invented it.  The world has become sad because a puppet was once melancholy.  The Nihilist, that strange martyr who has no faith, who goes to the stake without enthusiasm, and dies for what he does not believe in, is a purely literary product.  He was invented by Tourg?nieff, and completed by Dostoieffski.  Robespierre came out of the pages of Rousseau as surely as the People's Palace rose out of the _d?bris_ of a novel.  Literature always anticipates life.  It does not copy it, but moulds it to its purpose.  The nineteenth century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac.  Our Luciens de Rubempr?, our Rastignacs, and De Marsays made their first appearance on the stage of the _Com?die Humaine_.  We are merely carrying out, with footnotes and unnecessary additions, the whim or fancy or creative vision of a great novelist.  I once asked a lady, who knew Thackeray intimately, whether he had had any model for Becky Sharp.  She told me that Becky was an invention, but that the idea of the character had been partly suggested by a governess who lived in the neighbourhood of Kensington Square, and was the companion of a very selfish and rich old woman.  I inquired what became of the governess, and she replied that, oddly enough, some years after the appearance of _Vanity Fair_, she ran away with the nephew of the lady with whom she was living, and for a short time made a great splash in society, quite in Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's style, and entirely by Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's methods.  Ultimately she came to grief, disappeared to the Continent, and used to be occasionally seen at Monte Carlo and other gambling places.  The noble gentleman from whom the same great sentimentalist drew Colonel Newcome died, a few months after _The Newcomer_ had reached a fourth edition, with the word ?Adsum? on his lips.  Shortly after Mr. Stevenson published his curious psychological story of transformation, a friend of mine, called Mr. Hyde, was in the north of London, and being anxious to get to a railway station, took what he thought would be a short cut, lost his way, and found himself in a network of mean, evil-looking streets.  Feeling rather nervous he began to walk extremely fast, when suddenly out of an archway ran a child right between his legs.  It fell on the pavement, he tripped over it, and trampled upon it.  Being of course very much frightened and a little hurt, it began to scream, and in a few seconds the whole street was full of rough people who came pouring out of the houses like ants.  They surrounded him, and asked him his name.  He was just about to give it when he suddenly remembered the opening incident in Mr. Stevenson's story.  He was so filled with horror at having realised in his own person that terrible and well-written scene, and at having done accidentally, though in fact, what the Mr. Hyde of fiction had done with deliberate intent, that he ran away as hard as he could go.  He was, however, very closely followed, and finally he took refuge in a surgery, the door of which happened to be open, where he explained to a young assistant, who happened to be there, exactly what had occurred.  The humanitarian crowd were induced to go away on his giving them a small sum of money, and as soon as the coast was clear he left.  As he passed out, the name on the brass door-plate of the surgery caught his eye.  It was ?Jekyll.?  At least it should have been.  Here the imitation, as far as it went, was of course accidental.  In the following case the imitation was self-conscious.  In the year 1879, just after I had left Oxford, I met at a reception at the house of one of the Foreign Ministers a woman of very curious exotic beauty.  We became great friends, and were constantly together.  And yet what interested me most in her was not her beauty, but her character, her entire vagueness of character.  She seemed to have no personality at all, but simply the possibility of many types.  Sometimes she would give herself up entirely to art, turn her drawing-room into a studio, and spend two or three days a week at picture galleries or museums.  Then she would take to attending race-meetings, wear the most horsey clothes, and talk about nothing but betting.  She abandoned religion for mesmerism, mesmerism for politics, and politics for the melodramatic excitements of philanthropy.  In fact, she was a kind of Proteus, and as much a failure in all her transformations as was that wondrous sea-god when Odysseus laid hold of him.  One day a serial began in one of the French magazines.  At that time I used to read serial stories, and I well remember the shock of surprise I felt when I came to the description of the heroine.  She was so like my friend that I brought her the magazine, and she recognised herself in it immediately, and seemed fascinated by the resemblance.  I should tell you, by the way, that the story was translated from some dead Russian writer, so that the author had not taken his type from my friend. Well, to put the matter briefly, some months afterwards I was in Venice, and finding the magazine in the reading-room of the hotel, I took it up casually to see what had become of the heroine.  It was a most piteous tale, as the girl had ended by running away with a man absolutely inferior to her, not merely in social station, but in character and intellect also.  I wrote to my friend that evening about my views on John Bellini, and the admirable ices at Florian's, and the artistic value of gondolas, but added a postscript to the effect that her double in the story had behaved in a very silly manner.  I don?t know why I added that, but I remember I had a sort of dread over me that she might do the same thing.  Before my letter had reached her, she had run away with a man who deserted her in six months.  I saw her in 1884 in Paris, where she was living with her mother, and I asked her whether the story had had anything to do with her action.  She told me that she had felt an absolutely irresistible impulse to follow the heroine step by step in her strange and fatal progress, and that it was with a feeling of real terror that she had looked forward to the last few chapters of the story.  When they appeared, it seemed to her that she was compelled to reproduce them in life, and she did so.  It was a most clear example of this imitative instinct of which I was speaking, and an extremely tragic one.  However, I do not wish to dwell any further upon individual instances. Personal experience is a most vicious and limited circle.  All that I desire to point out is the general principle that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life, and I feel sure that if you think seriously about it you will find that it is true.  Life holds the mirror up to Art, and either reproduces some strange type imagined by painter or sculptor, or realises in fact what has been dreamed in fiction.  Scientifically speaking, the basis of life?the energy of life, as Aristotle would call it?is simply the desire for expression, and Art is always presenting various forms through which this expression can be attained.  Life seizes on them and uses them, even if they be to her own hurt.  Young men have committed suicide because Rolla did so, have died by their own hand because by his own hand Werther died.  Think of what we owe to the imitation of Christ, of what we owe to the imitation of C'sar.  CYRIL.  The theory is certainly a very curious one, but to make it complete you must show that Nature, no less than Life, is an imitation of Art.  Are you prepared to prove that?  VIVIAN.  My dear fellow, I am prepared to prove anything.  CYRIL.  Nature follows the landscape painter, then, and takes her effects from him?  VIVIAN.  Certainly.  Where, if not from the Impressionists, do we get those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping down our streets, blurring the gas-lamps and changing the houses into monstrous shadows?  To whom, if not to them and their master, do we owe the lovely silver mists that brood over our river, and turn to faint forms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying barge?  The extraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of London during the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school of Art.  You smile.  Consider the matter from a scientific or a metaphysical point of view, and you will find that I am right.  For what is Nature?  Nature is no great mother who has borne us. She is our creation.  It is in our brain that she quickens to life. Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it, depends on the Arts that have influenced us.  To look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing.  One does not see anything until one sees its beauty.  Then, and then only, does it come into existence.  At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London.  I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them.  They did not e|2
60|xist till Art had invented them.  Now, it must be admitted, fogs are carried to excess.  They have become the mere mannerism of a clique, and the exaggerated realism of their method gives dull people bronchitis. Where the cultured catch an effect, the uncultured catch cold.  And so, let us be humane, and invite Art to turn her wonderful eyes elsewhere. She has done so already, indeed.  That white quivering sunlight that one sees now in France, with its strange blotches of mauve, and its restless violet shadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the whole, Nature reproduces it quite admirably.  Where she used to give us Corots and Daubignys, she gives us now exquisite Monets and entrancing Pissaros.  Indeed there are moments, rare, it is true, but still to be observed from time to time, when Nature becomes absolutely modern.  Of course she is not always to be relied upon.  The fact is that she is in this unfortunate position.  Art creates an incomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on to other things.  Nature, upon the other hand, forgetting that imitation can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps on repeating this effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it.  Nobody of any real culture, for instance, ever talks nowadays about the beauty of a sunset. Sunsets are quite old-fashioned.  They belong to the time when Turner was the last note in art.  To admire them is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament.  Upon the other hand they go on.  Yesterday evening Mrs. Arundel insisted on my going to the window, and looking at the glorious sky, as she called it.  Of course I had to look at it.  She is one of those absurdly pretty Philistines to whom one can deny nothing.  And what was it?  It was simply a very second-rate Turner, a Turner of a bad period, with all the painter's worst faults exaggerated and over-emphasised.  Of course, I am quite ready to admit that Life very often commits the same error.  She produces her false Ren's and her sham Vautrins, just as Nature gives us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp, and on another a more than questionable Rousseau.  Still, Nature irritates one more when she does things of that kind.  It seems so stupid, so obvious, so unnecessary.  A false Vautrin might be delightful.  A doubtful Cuyp is unbearable.  However, I don?t want to be too hard on Nature.  I wish the Channel, especially at Hastings, did not look quite so often like a Henry Moore, grey pearl with yellow lights, but then, when Art is more varied, Nature will, no doubt, be more varied also.  That she imitates Art, I don?t think even her worst enemy would deny now.  It is the one thing that keeps her in touch with civilised man.  But have I proved my theory to your satisfaction?  CYRIL.  You have proved it to my dissatisfaction, which is better.  But even admitting this strange imitative instinct in Life and Nature, surely you would acknowledge that Art expresses the temper of its age, the spirit of its time, the moral and social conditions that surround it, and under whose influence it is produced.  VIVIAN.  Certainly not!  Art never expresses anything but itself.  This is the principle of my new 'sthetics; and it is this, more than that vital connection between form and substance, on which Mr. Pater dwells, that makes music the type of all the arts.  Of course, nations and individuals, with that healthy natural vanity which is the secret of existence, are always under the impression that it is of them that the Muses are talking, always trying to find in the calm dignity of imaginative art some mirror of their own turbid passions, always forgetting that the singer of life is not Apollo but Marsyas.  Remote from reality, and with her eyes turned away from the shadows of the cave, Art reveals her own perfection, and the wondering crowd that watches the opening of the marvellous, many-petalled rose fancies that it is its own history that is being told to it, its own spirit that is finding expression in a new form.  But it is not so.  The highest art rejects the burden of the human spirit, and gains more from a new medium or a fresh material than she does from any enthusiasm for art, or from any lofty passion, or from any great awakening of the human consciousness.  She develops purely on her own lines.  She is not symbolic of any age.  It is the ages that are her symbols.  Even those who hold that Art is representative of time and place and people cannot help admitting that the more imitative an art is, the less it represents to us the spirit of its age.  The evil faces of the Roman emperors look out at us from the foul porphyry and spotted jasper in which the realistic artists of the day delighted to work, and we fancy that in those cruel lips and heavy sensual jaws we can find the secret of the ruin of the Empire.  But it was not so.  The vices of Tiberius could not destroy that supreme civilisation, any more than the virtues of the Antonines could save it.  It fell for other, for less interesting reasons.  The sibyls and prophets of the Sistine may indeed serve to interpret for some that new birth of the emancipated spirit that we call the Renaissance; but what do the drunken boors and bawling peasants of Dutch art tell us about the great soul of Holland?  The more abstract, the more ideal an art is, the more it reveals to us the temper of its age.  If we wish to understand a nation by means of its art, let us look at its architecture or its music.  CYRIL.  I quite agree with you there.  The spirit of an age may be best expressed in the abstract ideal arts, for the spirit itself is abstract and ideal.  Upon the other hand, for the visible aspect of an age, for its look, as the phrase goes, we must of course go to the arts of imitation.  VIVIAN.  I don?t think so.  After all, what the imitative arts really give us are merely the various styles of particular artists, or of certain schools of artists.  Surely you don?t imagine that the people of the Middle Ages bore any resemblance at all to the figures on medi?val stained glass, or in medi?val stone and wood carving, or on medi?val metal-work, or tapestries, or illuminated MSS.  They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with nothing grotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance.  The Middle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form of style, and there is no reason at all why an artist with this style should not be produced in the nineteenth century. No great artist ever sees things as they really are.  If he did, he would cease to be an artist.  Take an example from our own day.  I know that you are fond of Japanese things.  Now, do you really imagine that the Japanese people, as they are presented to us in art, have any existence? If you do, you have never understood Japanese art at all.  The Japanese people are the deliberate self-conscious creation of certain individual artists.  If you set a picture by Hokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters, beside a real Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not the slightest resemblance between them.  The actual people who live in Japan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is to say, they are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious or extraordinary about them.  In fact the whole of Japan is a pure invention.  There is no such country, there are no such people.  One of our most charming painters went recently to the Land of the Chrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the Japanese.  All he saw, all he had the chance of painting, were a few lanterns and some fans.  He was quite unable to discover the inhabitants, as his delightful exhibition at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery showed only too well.  He did not know that the Japanese people are, as I have said, simply a mode of style, an exquisite fancy of art.  And so, if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will not behave like a tourist and go to Tokio.  On the contrary, you will stay at home and steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists, and then, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caught their imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon and sit in the Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see an absolutely Japanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere.  Or, to return again to the past, take as another instance the ancient Greeks.  Do you think that Greek art ever tells us what the Greek people were like?  Do you believe that the Athenian women were like the stately dignified figures of the Parthenon frieze, or like those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pediments of the same building?  If you judge from the art, they certainly were so.  But read an authority, like Aristophanes, for instance.  You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore high-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged their faces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallen creature of our own day.  The fact is that we look back on the ages entirely through the medium of art, and art, very fortunately, has never once told us the truth.  CYRIL.  But modern portraits by English painters, what of them?  Surely they are like the people they pretend to represent?  VIVIAN.  Quite so.  They are so like them that a hundred years from now no one will believe in them.  The only portraits in which one believes are portraits where there is very little of the sitter, and a very great deal of the artist.  Holbein's drawings of the men and women of his time impress us with a sense of their absolute reality.  But this is simply because Holbein compelled life to accept his conditions, to restrain itself within his limitations, to reproduce his type, and to appear as he wished it to appear.  It is style that makes us believe in a thing?nothing but style.  Most of our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion.  They never paint what they see.  They paint what the public sees, and the public never sees anything.  CYRIL.  Well, after that I think I should like to hear the end of your article.  VIVIAN.  With pleasure.  Whether it will do any good I really cannot say. Ours is certainly the dullest and most prosaic century possible.  Why, even Sleep has played us false, and has closed up the gates of ivory, and opened the gates of horn.  The dreams of the great middle classes of this country, as recorded in Mr. Myers's two bulky volumes on the subject, and in the Transactions of the Psychical Society, are the most depressing things that I have ever read.  There is not even a fine nightmare among them.  They are commonplace, sordid and tedious.  As for the Church, I cannot conceive anything better for the culture of a country than the presence in it of a body of men whose duty it is to believe in the supernatural, to perform daily miracles, and to keep alive that mythopoeic faculty which is so essential for the imagination.  But in the English Church a man succeeds, not through his capacity for belief, but through his capacity for disbelief.  Ours is the only Church where the sceptic stands at the altar, and where St. Thomas is regarded as the ideal apostle.  Many a worthy clergyman, who passes his life in admirable works of kindly charity, lives and dies unnoticed and unknown; but it is sufficient for some shallow uneducated passman out of either University to get up in his pulpit and express his doubts about Noah's ark, or Balaam's ass, or Jonah and the whale, for half of London to flock to hear him, and to sit open-mouthed in rapt admiration at his superb intellect. The growth of common sense in the English Church is a thing very much to be regretted.  It is really a degrading concession to a low form of realism.  It is silly, too.  It springs from an entire ignorance of psychology.  Man can believe the impossible, but man can never believe the improbable.  However, I must read the end of my article:?  ?What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is to revive this old art of Lying.  Much of course may be done, in the way of educating the public, by amateurs in the domestic circle, at literary lunches, and at afternoon teas.  But this is merely the light and graceful side of lying, such as was probably heard at Cretan dinner-parties.  There are many other forms.  Lying for the sake of gaining some immediate personal advantage, for instance?lying with a moral purpose, as it is usually called?though of late it has been rather looked down upon, was extremely popular with the antique world.  Athena laughs when Odysseus tells her ?his words of sly devising,? as Mr. William Morris phrases it, and the glory of mendacity illumines the pale brow of the stainless hero of Euripidean tragedy, and sets among the noble women of the past the young bride of one of Horace's most exquisite odes.  Later on, what at first had been merely a natural instinct was elevated into a self-conscious science.  Elaborate rules were laid down for the guidance of mankind, and an important school of literature grew up round the subject.  Indeed, when one remembers the excellent philosophical treatise of Sanchez on the whole question, one cannot help regretting that no one has ever thought of publishing a cheap and condensed edition of the works of that great casuist.  A short primer, ?When to Lie and How,? if brought out in an attractive and not too expensive a form, would no doubt command a large sale, and would prove of real practical service to many earnest and deep-thinking people.  Lying for the sake of the improvement of the young, which is the basis of home education, still lingers amongst us, and its advantages are so admirably set forth in the early books of Plato's _Republic_ that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them here.  It is a mode of lying for which all good mothers have peculiar capabilities, but it is capable of still further development, and has been sadly overlooked by the School Board.  Lying for the sake of a monthly salary is of course well known in Fleet Street, and the profession of a political leader-writer is not without its advantages.  But it is said to be a somewhat dull occupation, and it certainly does not lead to much beyond a kind of ostentatious obscurity. The only form of lying that is absolutely beyond reproach is lying for its own sake, and the highest development of this is, as we have already pointed out, Lying in Art.  Just as those who do not love Plato more than Truth cannot pass beyond the threshold of the Academe, so those who do not love Beauty more than Truth never know the inmost shrine of Art.  The solid stolid British intellect lies in the desert sands like the Sphinx in Flaubert's marvellous tale, and fantasy, _La Chim?re_, dances round it, and calls to it with her false, flute-toned voice.  It may not hear her now, but surely some day, when we are all bored to death with the commonplace character of modern fiction, it will hearken to her and try to borrow her wings.  ?And when that day dawns, or sunset reddens, how joyous we shall all be! Facts will be regarded as discreditable, Truth will be found mourning over her fetters, and Romance, with her temper of wonder, will return to the land.  The very aspect of the world will change to our startled eyes. Out of the sea will rise Behemoth and Leviathan, and sail round the high-pooped galleys, as they do on the delightful maps of those ages when books on geography were actually readable.  Dragons will wander about the waste places, and the phoenix will soar from her nest of fire into the air.  We shall lay our hands upon the basilisk, and see the jewel in the toad's head.  Champing his gilded oats, the Hippogriff will stand in our stalls, and over our heads will float the Blue Bird singing of beautiful and impossible things, of things that are lovely and that never happen, of things that are not and that should be.  But before this comes to pass we must cultivate the lost art of Lying.?  CYRIL.  Then we must entirely cultivate it at once.  But in order to avoid making any error I want you to tell me briefly the doctrines of the new 'sthetics.  VIVIAN.  Briefly, then, they are these.  Art never expresses anything but itself.  It has an independent life, just as Thought has, and develops purely on its own lines.  It is not necessarily realistic in an age of realism, nor spiritual in an age of faith.  So far from being the creation of its time, it is usually in direct opposition to it, and the only history that it preserves for us is the history of its own progress. Sometimes it returns upon its footsteps, and revives some antique form, as happened in the archaistic movement of late Greek Art, and in the pre-Raphaelite movement of our own day.  At other times it entirely anticipates its age, and produces in one century work that it takes another century to understand, to appreciate and to enjoy.  In no case does it reproduce its age.  To pass from the art of a time to the time itself is the great mistake that all historians commit.  The second doctrine is this.  All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals.  Life and Nature may sometimes be used as part of Art's rough material, but before they are of any real service to art they must be translated into artistic conventions.  The moment Art surrenders its imaginative medium it surrenders everything.  As a method Realism is a complete failure, and the two things that every artist should avoid are modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter.  To us, who live in the nineteenth century, any century is a suitable subject for art except our own.  The only beautiful things are the things that do not concern us.  It is, to have the pleasure of quoting myself, exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are so suitable a motive for a tragedy.  Besides, it is only the modern that ever becomes old-fashioned.  M. Zola sits down to give us a picture of the Second Empire.  Who cares for the Second Empire now?  It is out of date.  Life goes faster than Realism, but Romanticism is always in front of Life.  The third doctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.  This results not merely from Life's imitative instinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life is to find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful forms through which it may realise that energy.  It is a theory that has never been put forward before, but it is extremely fruitful, and throws an entirely new light upon the history of Art.  It follows, as a corollary from this, that external Nature also imitates Art.  The only effects that she can show us are effects that we have already seen through poetry, or in paintings.  This is the secret of Nature's charm, as well as the explanation of Nature's weakness.  The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.  But of this I think I have spoken at sufficient length.  And now let us go out on the terrace, where ?droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,? while the evening star ?washes the dusk with silver.?  At twilight nature becomes a wonderfully suggestive effect, and is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to illustrate quotations from the poets.  Come!  We have talked long enough.     PEN, PENCIL AND POISON A STUDY IN GREEN   IT has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artists and men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness and completeness of nature. As a rule this must necessarily be so.  That very concentration of vision and intensity of purpose which is the characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a mode of limitation.  To those who are preoccupied with the beauty of form nothing else seems of much importance.  Yet there are many exceptions to this rule.  Rubens served as ambassador, and Goethe as state councillor, and Milton as Latin secretary to Cromwell.  Sophocles held civic office in his own city; the humourists, essayists, and novelists of modern America seem to desire nothing better than to become the diplomatic representatives of their country; and Charles Lamb's friend, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, the subject of this brief memoir, though of an extremely artistic temperament, followed many masters other than art, being not merely a poet and a painter, an art-critic, an antiquarian, and a writer of prose, an amateur of beautiful things, and a dilettante of things delightful, but also a forger of no mean or ordinary capabilities, and as a subtle and secret poisoner almost without rival in this or any age.  This remarkable man, so powerful with ?pen, pencil and poison,? as a great poet of our own day has finely said of him, was born at Chiswick, in 1794.  His father was the son of a distinguished solicitor of Gray's Inn and Hatton Garden.  His mother was the daughter of the celebrated Dr. Griffiths, the editor and founder of the _Monthly Review_, the partner in another literary speculation of Thomas Davis, that famous bookseller of whom Johnson said that he was not a bookseller, but ?a gentleman who dealt in books,? the friend of Goldsmith and Wedgwood, and one of the most well-known men of his day.  Mrs. Wainewright died, in giving him birth, at the early age of twenty-one, and an obituary notice in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ tells us of her ?amiable disposition and numerous accomplishments,? and adds somewhat quaintly that 'she is supposed to have understood the writings of Mr. Locke as well as perhaps any person of either sex now living.?  His father did not long survive his young wife, and the little child seems to have been brought up by his grandfather, and, on the death of the latter in 1803, by his uncle George Edward Griffiths, whom he subsequently poisoned.  His boyhood was passed at Linden House, Turnham Green, one of those many fine Georgian mansions that have unfortunately disappeared before the inroads of the suburban builder, and to its lovely gardens and well-timbered park he owed that simple and impassioned love of nature which never left him all through his life, and which made him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual influences of Wordsworth's poetry.  He went to school at Charles Burney's academy at Hammersmith.  Mr. Burney was the son of the historian of music, and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turn out his most remarkable pupil.  He seems to have been a man of a good deal of culture, and in after years Mr. Wainewright often spoke of him with much affection as a philosopher, an arch?ologist, and an admirable teacher who, while he valued the intellectual side of education, did not forget the importance of early moral training.  It was under Mr. Burney that he first developed his talent as an artist, and Mr. Hazlitt tells us that a drawing-book which he used at school is still extant, and displays great talent and natural feeling.  Indeed, painting was the first art that fascinated him.  It was not till much later that he sought to find expression by pen or poison.  Before this, however, he seems to have been carried away by boyish dreams of the romance and chivalry of a soldier's life, and to have become a young guardsman.  But the reckless dissipated life of his companions failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament of one who was made for other things.  In a short time he wearied of the service.  ?Art,? he tells us, in words that still move many by their ardent sincerity and strange fervour, ?Art touched her renegade; by her pure and high influence the noisome mists were purged; my feelings, parched, hot, and tarnished, were renovated with cool, fresh bloom, simple, beautiful to the simple-hearted.?  But Art was not the only cause of the change.  ?The writings of Wordsworth,? he goes on to say, ?did much towards calming the confusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations.  I wept over them tears of happiness and gratitude.?  He accordingly left the army, with its rough barrack-life and coarse mess-room tittle-tattle, and returned to Linden House, full of this new-born enthusiasm for culture. A severe illness, in which, to use his own words, he was ?broken like a vessel of clay,? prostrated him for a time.  His delicately strung organisation, however indifferent it might have been to inflicting pain on others, was itself most keenly sensitive to pain.  He shrank from suffering as a thing that mars and maims human life, and seems to have wandered through that terrible valley of melancholia from which so many great, perhaps greater, spirits have never emerged.  But he was young?only twenty-five years of age?and he soon passed out of the ?dead black waters,? as he called them, into the larger air of humanistic culture.  As he was recovering from the illness that had led him almost to the gates of death, he conceived the idea of taking up literature as an art.  ?I said with John Woodvil,? he cries, ?it were a life of gods to dwell in such an element,? to see and hear and write brave things:?      ?These high and gusty relishes of life     Have no allayings of mortality.?  It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have the utterance of a man who had a true passion for letters.  ?To see and hear and write brave things,? this was his aim.  Scott, the editor of the _London Magazine_, struck by the young man's genius, or under the influence of the strange fascination that he exercised on every one who knew him, invited him to write a series of articles on artistic subjects, and under a series of fanciful pseudonym he began to contribute to the literature of his day.  _Janus Weathercock_, _Egomet Bonmot_, and _Van Vinkvooms_, were some of the grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousness or to reveal his levity.  A mask tells us more than a face.  These disguises intensified his personality.  In an incredibly short time he seems to have made his mark.  Charles Lamb speaks of ?kind, light-hearted Wainewright,? whose prose is ?capital.?  We hear of him entertaining Macready, John Forster, Maginn, Talfourd, Sir Wentworth Dilke, the poet John Clare, and others, at _a petit-d?ner_.  Like Disraeli, he determined to startle the town as a dandy, and his beautiful rings, his antique cameo breast-pin, and his pale lemon-coloured kid gloves, were well known, and indeed were regarded by Hazlitt as being the signs of a new manner in literature: while his rich curly hair, fine eyes, and exquisite white hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction of being different from others.  There was something in him of Balzac's Lucien de Rubempr?.  At times he reminds us of Julien Sorel.  De Quincey saw him once.  It was at a dinner at Charles Lamb's.  ?Amongst the company, all literary men, sat a murderer,? he tells us, and he goes on to describe how on that day he had been ill, and had hated the face of man and woman, and yet found himself looking with intellectual interest across the table at the young writer beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to him to lie so much unaffected sensibility, and speculates on ?what sudden growth of another interest? would have changed his mood, had he known of what terrible sin the guest to whom Lamb paid so much attention was even then guilty.  His life-work falls naturally under the three heads suggested by Mr. Swinburne, and it may be partly admitted that, if we set aside his achievements in the sphere of poison, what he has actually left to us hardly justifies his reputation.  But then it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate a personality by the vulgar test of production.  This young dandy sought to be somebody, rather than to do something.  He recognised that Life itself is in art, and has its modes of style no less than the arts that seek to express it. Nor is his work without interest.  We hear of William Blake stopping in the Royal Academy before one of his pictures and pronouncing it to be ?very fine.?  His essays are prefiguring of much that has since been realised.  He seems to have anticipated some of those accidents of modern culture that are regarded by many as true essentials.  He writes about La Gioconda, and early French poets and the Italian Renaissance.  He loves Greek gems, and Persian carpets, and Elizabethan translations of _Cupid and Psyche_, and the _Hypnerotomachia_, and book-binding and early editions, and wide-margined proofs.  He is keenly sensitive to the value of beautiful surroundi|2
61|ngs, and never wearies of describing to us the rooms in which he lived, or would have liked to live.  He had that curious love of green, which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament, and in nations is said to denote a laxity, if not a decadence of morals.  Like Baudelaire he was extremely fond of cats, and with Gautier, he was fascinated by that 'sweet marble monster? of both sexes that we can still see at Florence and in the Louvre.  There is of course much in his descriptions, and his suggestions for decoration, that shows that he did not entirely free himself from the false taste of his time.  But it is clear that he was one of the first to recognise what is, indeed, the very keynote of 'sthetic eclecticism, I mean the true harmony of all really beautiful things irrespective of age or place, of school or manner.  He saw that in decorating a room, which is to be, not a room for show, but a room to live in, we should never aim at any arch?ological reconstruction of the past, nor burden ourselves with any fanciful necessity for historical accuracy.  In this artistic perception he was perfectly right.  All beautiful things belong to the same age.  And so, in his own library, as he describes it, we find the delicate fictile vase of the Greek, with its exquisitely painted figures and the faint ????? finely traced upon its side, and behind it hangs an engraving of the ?Delphic Sibyl? of Michael Angelo, or of the ?Pastoral? of Giorgione.  Here is a bit of Florentine majolica, and here a rude lamp from some old Roman tomb. On the table lies a book of Hours, ?cased in a cover of solid silver gilt, wrought with quaint devices and studded with small brilliants and rubies,? and close by it 'squats a little ugly monster, a Lar, perhaps, dug up in the sunny fields of corn-bearing Sicily.?  Some dark antique bronzes contrast with the pale gleam of two noble _Christi Crucifixi_, one carved in ivory, the other moulded in wax.?  He has his trays of Tassie's gems, his tiny Louis-Quatorze _bonbonni?re_ with a miniature by Petitot, his highly prized ?brown-biscuit teapots, filagree-worked,? his citron morocco letter-case, and his ?pomona-green? chair.  One can fancy him lying there in the midst of his books and casts and engravings, a true virtuoso, a subtle connoisseur, turning over his fine collection of Mare Antonios, and his Turner's ?Liber Studiorum,? of which he was a warm admirer, or examining with a magnifier some of his antique gems and cameos, ?the head of Alexander on an onyx of two strata,? or ?that superb _altissimo relievo_ on cornelian, Jupiter ?giochus.?  He was always a great amateur of engravings, and gives some very useful suggestions as to the best means of forming a collection.  Indeed, while fully appreciating modern art, he never lost sight of the importance of reproductions of the great masterpieces of the past, and all that he says about the value of plaster casts is quite admirable.  As an art-critic he concerned himself primarily with the complex impressions produced by a work of art, and certainly the first step in 'sthetic criticism is to realise one's own impressions.  He cared nothing for abstract discussions on the nature of the Beautiful, and the historical method, which has since yielded such rich fruit, did not belong to his day, but he never lost sight of the great truth that Art's first appeal is neither to the intellect nor to the emotions, but purely to the artistic temperament, and he more than once points out that this temperament, this ?taste,? as he calls it, being unconsciously guided and made perfect by frequent contact with the best work, becomes in the end a form of right judgment.  Of course there are fashions in art just as there are fashions in dress, and perhaps none of us can ever quite free ourselves from the influence of custom and the influence of novelty.  He certainly could not, and he frankly acknowledges how difficult it is to form any fair estimate of contemporary work.  But, on the whole, his taste was good and sound.  He admired Turner and Constable at a time when they were not so much thought of as they are now, and saw that for the highest landscape art we require more than ?mere industry and accurate transcription.?  Of Crome's ?Heath Scene near Norwich? he remarks that it shows ?how much a subtle observation of the elements, in their wild moods, does for a most uninteresting flat,? and of the popular type of landscape of his day he says that it is 'simply an enumeration of hill and dale, stumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages and houses; little more than topography, a kind of pictorial map-work; in which rainbows, showers, mists, haloes, large beams shooting through rifted clouds, storms, starlight, all the most valued materials of the real painter, are not.?  He had a thorough dislike of what is obvious or commonplace in art, and while he was charmed to entertain Wilkie at dinner, he cared as little for Sir David's pictures as he did for Mr. Crabbe's poems.  With the imitative and realistic tendencies of his day he had no sympathy and he tells us frankly that his great admiration for Fuseli was largely due to the fact that the little Swiss did not consider it necessary that an artist should paint only what he sees.  The qualities that he sought for in a picture were composition, beauty and dignity of line, richness of colour, and imaginative power.  Upon the other hand, he was not a doctrinaire.  ?I hold that no work of art can be tried otherwise than by laws deduced from itself: whether or not it be consistent with itself is the question.?  This is one of his excellent aphorisms.  And in criticising painters so different as Landseer and Martin, Stothard and Etty, he shows that, to use a phrase now classical, he is trying ?to see the object as in itself it really is.?  However, as I pointed out before, he never feels quite at his ease in his criticisms of contemporary work.  ?The present,? he says, ?is about as agreeable a confusion to me as Ariosto on the first perusal. . . . Modern things dazzle me.  I must look at them through Time's telescope.  Elia complains that to him the merit of a MS. poem is uncertain; ?print,? as he excellently says, 'settles it.?  Fifty years? toning does the same thing to a picture.?  He is happier when he is writing about Watteau and Lancret, about Rubens and Giorgione, about Rembrandt, Corregio, and Michael Angelo; happiest of all when he is writing about Greek things. What is Gothic touched him very little, but classical art and the art of the Renaissance were always dear to him.  He saw what our English school could gain from a study of Greek models, and never wearies of pointing out to the young student the artistic possibilities that lie dormant in Hellenic marbles and Hellenic methods of work.  In his judgments on the great Italian Masters, says De Quincey, ?there seemed a tone of sincerity and of native sensibility, as in one who spoke for himself, and was not merely a copier from books.?  The highest praise that we can give to him is that he tried to revive style as a conscious tradition.  But he saw that no amount of art lectures or art congresses, or ?plans for advancing the fine arts,? will ever produce this result.  The people, he says very wisely, and in the true spirit of Toynbee Hall, must always have ?the best models constantly before their eyes.?  As is to be expected from one who was a painter, he is often extremely technical in his art criticisms.  Of Tintoret's ?St. George delivering the Egyptian Princess from the Dragon,? he remarks:?      The robe of Sabra, warmly glazed with Prussian blue, is relieved from     the pale greenish background by a vermilion scarf; and the full hues     of both are beautifully echoed, as it were, in a lower key by the     purple-lake coloured stuffs and bluish iron armour of the saint,     besides an ample balance to the vivid azure drapery on the foreground     in the indigo shades of the wild wood surrounding the castle.  And elsewhere he talks learnedly of ?a delicate Schiavone, various as a tulip-bed, with rich broken tints,? of ?a glowing portrait, remarkable for _morbidezza_, by the scarce Moroni,? and of another picture being ?pulpy in the carnations.?  But, as a rule, he deals with his impressions of the work as an artistic whole, and tries to translate those impressions into words, to give, as it were, the literary equivalent for the imaginative and mental effect. He was one of the first to develop what has been called the art-literature of the nineteenth century, that form of literature which has found in Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning, its two most perfect exponents. His description of Lancret's _Repas Italien_, in which ?a dark-haired girl, ?amorous of mischief,? lies on the daisy-powdered grass,? is in some respects very charming.  Here is his account of ?The Crucifixion,? by Rembrandt.  It is extremely characteristic of his style? In this passage, written, the author tells us, ?in awe and reverence,? there is much that is terrible, and very much that is quite horrible, but it is not without a certain crude form of power, or, at any rate, a certain crude violence of words, a quality which this age should highly appreciate, as it is its chief defect.  It is pleasanter, however, to pass to this description of Giulio Romano's ?Cephalus and Procris?:?  Were this description carefully re-written, it would be quite admirable. The conception of making a prose poem out of paint is excellent.  Much of the best modern literature springs from the same aim.  In a very ugly and sensible age, the arts borrow, not from life, but from each other.  His sympathies, too, were wonderfully varied.  In everything connected with the stage, for instance, he was always extremely interested, and strongly upheld the necessity for arch?ological accuracy in costume and scene-painting.  ?In art,? he says in one of his essays, ?whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well?; and he points out that once we allow the intrusion of anachronisms, it becomes difficult to say where the line is to be drawn.  In literature, again, like Lord Beaconsfield on a famous occasion, he was ?on the side of the angels.?  He was one of the first to admire Keats and Shelley??the tremulously-sensitive and poetical Shelley,? as he calls him.  His admiration for Wordsworth was sincere and profound.  He thoroughly appreciated William Blake.  One of the best copies of the ?Songs of Innocence and Experience? that is now in existence was wrought specially for him.  He loved Alain Chartier, and Ronsard, and the Elizabethan dramatists, and Chaucer and Chapman, and Petrarch.  And to him all the arts were one.  ?Our critics,? he remarks with much wisdom, 'seem hardly aware of the identity of the primal seeds of poetry and painting, nor that any true advancement in the serious study of one art co-generates a proportionate perfection in the other?; and he says elsewhere that if a man who does not admire Michael Angelo talks of his love for Milton, he is deceiving either himself or his listeners.  To his fellow-contributors in the _London Magazine_ he was always most generous, and praises Barry Cornwall, Allan Cunningham, Hazlitt, Elton, and Leigh Hunt without anything of the malice of a friend.  Some of his sketches of Charles Lamb are admirable in their way, and, with the art of the true comedian, borrow their style from their subject:?  One side of his literary career deserves especial notice.  Modern journalism may be said to owe almost as much to him as to any man of the early part of this century.  He was the pioneer of Asiatic prose, and delighted in pictorial epithets and pompous exaggerations.  To have a style so gorgeous that it conceals the subject is one of the highest achievements of an important and much admired school of Fleet Street leader-writers, and this school _Janus Weathercock_ may be said to have invented.  He also saw that it was quite easy by continued reiteration to make the public interested in his own personality, and in his purely journalistic articles this extraordinary young man tells the world what he had for dinner, where he gets his clothes, what wines he likes, and in what state of health he is, just as if he were writing weekly notes for some popular newspaper of our own time.  This being the least valuable side of his work, is the one that has had the most obvious influence.  A publicist, nowadays, is a man who bores the community with the details of the illegalities of his private life.  Like most artificial people, he had a great love of nature.  ?I hold three things in high estimation,? he says somewhere: ?to sit lazily on an eminence that commands a rich prospect; to be shadowed by thick trees while the sun shines around me; and to enjoy solitude with the consciousness of neighbourhood.  The country gives them all to me.?  He writes about his wandering over fragrant furze and heath repeating Collins's ?Ode to Evening,? just to catch the fine quality of the moment; about smothering his face ?in a watery bed of cowslips, wet with May dews?; and about the pleasure of seeing the sweet-breathed kine ?pass slowly homeward through the twilight,? and hearing ?the distant clank of the sheep-bell.?  One phrase of his, ?the polyanthus glowed in its cold bed of earth, like a solitary picture of Giorgione on a dark oaken panel,? is curiously characteristic of his temperament, and this passage is rather pretty in its way:?   However, we must not forget that the cultivated young man who penned these lines, and who was so susceptible to Wordsworthian influences, was also, as I said at the beginning of this memoir, one of the most subtle and secret poisoners of this or any age.  How he first became fascinated by this strange sin he does not tell us, and the diary in which he carefully noted the results of his terrible experiments and the methods that he adopted, has unfortunately been lost to us.  Even in later days, too, he was always reticent on the matter, and preferred to speak about ?The Excursion,? and the ?Poems founded on the Affections.?  There is no doubt, however, that the poison that he used was strychnine.  In one of the beautiful rings of which he was so proud, and which served to show off the fine modelling of his delicate ivory hands, he used to carry crystals of the Indian _nux vomica_, a poison, one of his biographers tells us, ?nearly tasteless, difficult of discovery, and capable of almost infinite dilution.?  His murders, says De Quincey, were more than were ever made known judicially.  This is no doubt so, and some of them are worthy of mention.  His first victim was his uncle, Mr. Thomas Griffiths.  He poisoned him in 1829 to gain possession of Linden House, a place to which he had always been very much attached.  In the August of the next year he poisoned Mrs. Abercrombie, his wife's mother, and in the following December he poisoned the lovely Helen Abercrombie, his sister-in-law.  Why he murdered Mrs. Abercrombie is not ascertained.  It may have been for a caprice, or to quicken some hideous sense of power that was in him, or because she suspected something, or for no reason. But the murder of Helen Abercrombie was carried out by himself and his wife for the sake of a sum of about ?18,000, for which they had insured her life in various offices.  The circumstances were as follows.  On the 12th of December, he and his wife and child came up to London from Linden House, and took lodgings at No. 12 Conduit Street, Regent Street.  With them were the two sisters, Helen and Madeleine Abercrombie.  On the evening of the 14th they all went to the play, and at supper that night Helen sickened.  The next day she was extremely ill, and Dr. Locock, of Hanover Square, was called in to attend her.  She lived till Monday, the 20th, when, after the doctor's morning visit, Mr. and Mrs. Wainewright brought her some poisoned jelly, and then went out for a walk.  When they returned Helen Abercrombie was dead.  She was about twenty years of age, a tall graceful girl with fair hair.  A very charming red-chalk drawing of her by her brother-in-law is still in existence, and shows how much his style as an artist was influenced by Sir Thomas Lawrence, a painter for whose work he had always entertained a great admiration.  De Quincey says that Mrs. Wainewright was not really privy to the murder.  Let us hope that she was not.  Sin should be solitary, and have no accomplices.  The insurance companies, suspecting the real facts of the case, declined to pay the policy on the technical ground of misrepresentation and want of interest, and, with curious courage, the poisoner entered an action in the Court of Chancery against the Imperial, it being agreed that one decision should govern all the cases.  The trial, however, did not come on for five years, when, after one disagreement, a verdict was ultimately given in the companies? favour.  The judge on the occasion was Lord Abinger.  _Egomet Bonmot_ was represented by Mr. Erle and Sir William Follet, and the Attorney-General and Sir Frederick Pollock appeared for the other side.  The plaintiff, unfortunately, was unable to be present at either of the trials.  The refusal of the companies to give him the ?18,000 had placed him in a position of most painful pecuniary embarrassment.  Indeed, a few months after the murder of Helen Abercrombie, he had been actually arrested for debt in the streets of London while he was serenading the pretty daughter of one of his friends. This difficulty was got over at the time, but shortly afterwards he thought it better to go abroad till he could come to some practical arrangement with his creditors.  He accordingly went to Boulogne on a visit to the father of the young lady in question, and while he was there induced him to insure his life with the Pelican Company for ?3000.  As soon as the necessary formalities had been gone through and the policy executed, he dropped some crystals of strychnine into his coffee as they sat together one evening after dinner.  He himself did not gain any monetary advantage by doing this.  His aim was simply to revenge himself on the first office that had refused to pay him the price of his sin. His friend died the next day in his presence, and he left Boulogne at once for a sketching tour through the most picturesque parts of Brittany, and was for some time the guest of an old French gentleman, who had a beautiful country house at St. Omer.  From this he moved to Paris, where he remained for several years, living in luxury, some say, while others talk of his 'skulking with poison in his pocket, and being dreaded by all who knew him.?  In 1837 he returned to England privately.  Some strange mad fascination brought him back.  He followed a woman whom he loved.  It was the month of June, and he was staying at one of the hotels in Covent Garden.  His sitting-room was on the ground floor, and he prudently kept the blinds down for fear of being seen.  Thirteen years before, when he was making his fine collection of majolica and Marc Antonios, he had forged the names of his trustees to a power of attorney, which enabled him to get possession of some of the money which he had inherited from his mother, and had brought into marriage settlement.  He knew that this forgery had been discovered, and that by returning to England he was imperilling his life.  Yet he returned.  Should one wonder?  It was said that the woman was very beautiful.  Besides, she did not love him.  It was by a mere accident that he was discovered.  A noise in the street attracted his attention, and, in his artistic interest in modern life, he pushed aside the blind for a moment.  Some one outside called out, ?That's Wainewright, the Bank-forger.?  It was Forrester, the Bow Street runner.  On the 5th of July he was brought up at the Old Bailey.  The following report of the proceedings appeared in the _Times_:?  He was taken back to Newgate, preparatory to his removal to the colonies. In a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he had fancied himself ?lying in Horsemonger Gaol under sentence of death? for having been unable to resist the temptation of stealing some Marc Antonios from the British Museum in order to complete his collection.  The sentence now passed on him was to a man of his culture a form of death.  He complained bitterly of it to his friends, and pointed out, with a good deal of reason, some people may fancy, that the money was practically his own, having come to him from his mother, and that the forgery, such as it was, had been committed thirteen years before, which, to use his own phrase, was at least a _circonstance attenuante_.  The permanence of personality is a very subtle metaphysical problem, and certainly the English law solves the question in an extremely rough-and-ready manner.  There is, however, something dramatic in the fact that this heavy punishment was inflicted on him for what, if we remember his fatal influence on the prose of modern journalism, was certainly not the worst of all his sins.  While he was in gaol, Dickens, Macready, and Hablot Browne came across him by chance.  They had been going over the prisons of London, searching for artistic effects, and in Newgate they suddenly caught sight of Wainewright.  He met them with a defiant stare, Forster tells us, but Macready was ?horrified to recognise a man familiarly known to him in former years, and at whose table he had dined.?  Others had more curiosity, and his cell was for some time a kind of fashionable lounge.  Many men of letters went down to visit their old literary comrade.  But he was no longer the kind light-hearted Janus whom Charles Lamb admired.  He seems to have grown quite cynical.  To the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him one afternoon, and thought he would improve the occasion by pointing out that, after all, crime was a bad speculation, he replied: ?Sir, you City men enter on your speculations, and take the chances of them.  Some of your speculations succeed, some fail.  Mine happen to have failed, yours happen to have succeeded.  That is the only difference, sir, between my visitor and me.  But, sir, I will tell you one thing in which I have succeeded to the last.  I have been determined through life to hold the position of a gentleman.  I have always done so.  I do so still.  It is the custom of this place that each of the inmates of a cell shall take his morning's turn of sweeping it out.  I occupy a cell with a bricklayer and a sweep, but they never offer me the broom!?  When a friend reproached him with the murder of Helen Abercrombie he shrugged his shoulders and said, ?Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do, but she had very thick ankles.?  From Newgate he was brought to the hulks at Portsmouth, and sent from there in the _Susan_ to Van Diemen's Land along with three hundred other convicts.  The voyage seems to have been most distasteful to him, and in a letter written to a friend he spoke bitterly about the ignominy of ?the companion of poets and artists? being compelled to associate with ?country bumpkins.?  The phrase that he applies to his companions need not surprise us.  Crime in England is rarely the result of sin.  It is nearly always the result of starvation.  There was probably no one on board in whom he would have found a sympathetic listener, or even a psychologically interesting nature.  His love of art, however, never deserted him.  At Hobart Town he started a studio, and returned to sketching and portrait-painting, and his conversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm.  Nor did he give up his habit of poisoning, and there are two cases on record in which he tried to make away with people who had offended him.  But his hand seems to have lost its cunning.  Both of his attempts were complete failures, and in 1844, being thoroughly dissatisfied with Tasmanian society, he presented a memorial to the governor of the settlement, Sir John Eardley Wilmot, praying for a ticket-of-leave.  In it he speaks of himself as being ?tormented by ideas struggling for outward form and realisation, barred up from increase of knowledge, and deprived of the exercise of profitable or even of decorous speech.?  His request, however, was refused, and the associate of Coleridge consoled himself by making those marvellous _Paradis Artificiels_ whose secret is only known to the eaters of opium.  In 1852 he died of apoplexy, his sole living companion being a cat, for which he had evinced at extraordinary affection.  His crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art.  They gave a strong personality to his style, a quality that his early work certainly lacked.  In a note to the _Life of Dickens_, Forster mentions that in 1847 Lady Blessington received from her brother, Major Power, who held a military appointment at Hobart Town, an oil portrait of a young lady from his clever brush; and it is said that ?he had contrived to put the expression of his own wickedness into the portrait of a nice, kind-hearted girl.?  M. Zola, in one of his novels, tells us of a young man who, having committed a murder, takes to art, and paints greenish impressionist portraits of perfectly respectable people, all of which bear a curious resemblance to his victim.  The development of Mr. Wainewright's style seems to me far more subtle and suggestive.  One can fancy an intense personality being created out of sin.  This strange and fascinating figure that for a few years dazzled literary London, and made so brilliant a _d?but_ in life and letters, is undoubtedly a most interesting study.  Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, his latest biographer, to whom I am indebted for many of the facts contained in this memoir, and whose little book is, indeed, quite invaluable in its way, is of opinion that his love of art and nature was a mere pretence and assumption, and others have denied to him all literary power.  This seems to me a shallow, or at least a mistaken, view.  The fact of a man being a poisoner is nothing against his prose.  The domestic virtues are not the true basis of art, though they may serve as an excellent advertisement for second-rate artists.  It is possible that De Quincey exaggerated his critical powers, and I cannot help saying again that there is much in his published works that is too familiar, too common, too journalistic, in the bad sense of that bad word.  Here and there he is distinctly vulgar in expression, and he is always lacking in the self-restraint of the true artist.  But for some of his faults we must blame the time in which he lived, and, after all, prose that Charles Lamb thought ?capital? has no small historic interest.  That he had a sincere love of art and nature seems to me quite certain.  There is no essential incongruity between crime and culture.  We cannot re-write the whole of history for the purpose of gratifying our moral sense of what should be.  Of course, he is far too close to our own time for us to be able to form any purely artistic judgment about him.  It is impossible not to feel a strong prejudice against a man who might have poisoned Lord Tennyson, or Mr. Gladstone, or the Master of Balliol.  But had the man worn a costume and spoken a language different from our own, had he lived in imperial Rome, or at the time of the Italian Renaissance, or in Spain in the seventeenth century, or in any land or any century but this century and this land, we would be quite able to arrive at a perfectly unprejudiced estimate of his position and value.  I know that there are many historians, or at least writers on historical subjects, who still think it necessary to apply moral judgments to history, and who distribute their praise or blame with the solemn complacency of a successful schoolmaster.  This, however, is a foolish habit, and merely shows that the moral instinct can be brought to such a pitch of perfection that it will make its appearance wherever it is not required.  Nobody with the true historical sense ever dreams of blaming Nero, or scolding Tiberius, or censuring C'sar Borgia.  These personages have become like the puppets of a play.  They may fill us with terror, or horror, or wonder, but they do not harm us.  They are not in immediate relation to us.  We have nothing to fear from them.  They have passed into the sphere of art and science, and neither art nor science knows anything of moral approval or disapproval.  And so it may be some day with|2
62| Charles Lamb's friend.  At present I feel that he is just a little too modern to be treated in that fine spirit of disinterested curiosity to which we owe so many charming studies of the great criminals of the Italian Renaissance from the pens of Mr. John Addington Symonds, Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, Miss Vernon Lee, and other distinguished writers.  However, Art has not forgotten him.  He is the hero of Dickens's _Hunted Down_, the Varney of Bulwer's _Lucretia_; and it is gratifying to note that fiction has paid some homage to one who was so powerful with ?pen, pencil and poison.?  To be suggestive for fiction is to be of more importance than a fact.     THE CRITIC AS ARTIST WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING NOTHING   GILBERT (_at the Piano_).  My dear Ernest, what are you laughing at?  ERNEST (_looking up_).  At a capital story that I have just come across in this volume of Reminiscences that I have found on your table.  GILBERT.  What is the book?  Ah! I see.  I have not read it yet.  Is it good?  ERNEST.  Well, while you have been playing, I have been turning over the pages with some amusement, though, as a rule, I dislike modern memoirs. They are generally written by people who have either entirely lost their memories, or have never done anything worth remembering; which, however, is, no doubt, the true explanation of their popularity, as the English public always feels perfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it.  GILBERT.  Yes: the public is wonderfully tolerant.  It forgives everything except genius.  But I must confess that I like all memoirs.  I like them for their form, just as much as for their matter.  In literature mere egotism is delightful.  It is what fascinates us in the letters of personalities so different as Cicero and Balzac, Flaubert and Berlioz, Byron and Madame de S?vign?.  Whenever we come across it, and, strangely enough, it is rather rare, we cannot but welcome it, and do not easily forget it.  Humanity will always love Rousseau for having confessed his sins, not to a priest, but to the world, and the couchant nymphs that Cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of King Francis, the green and gold Perseus, even, that in the open Loggia at Florence shows the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have not given it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme scoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his shame.  The opinions, the character, the achievements of the man, matter very little.  He may be a sceptic like the gentle Sieur de Montaigne, or a saint like the bitter son of Monica, but when he tells us his own secrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to silence.  The mode of thought that Cardinal Newman represented?if that can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect?may not, cannot, I think, survive.  But the world will never weary of watching that troubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness.  The lonely church at Littlemore, where ?the breath of the morning is damp, and worshippers are few,? will always be dear to it, and whenever men see the yellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity they will think of that gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower's sure recurrence a prophecy that he would abide for ever with the Benign Mother of his days?a prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom or her folly, suffered not to be fulfilled.  Yes; autobiography is irresistible.  Poor, silly, conceited Mr. Secretary Pepys has chattered his way into the circle of the Immortals, and, conscious that indiscretion is the better part of valour, bustles about among them in that 'shaggy purple gown with gold buttons and looped lace? which he is so fond of describing to us, perfectly at his ease, and prattling, to his own and our infinite pleasure, of the Indian blue petticoat that he bought for his wife, of the ?good hog's hars-let,? and the ?pleasant French fricassee of veal? that he loved to eat, of his game of bowls with Will Joyce, and his ?gadding after beauties,? and his reciting of _Hamlet_ on a Sunday, and his playing of the viol on week days, and other wicked or trivial things.  Even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions.  When people talk to us about others they are usually dull.  When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up, when they become wearisome, as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied, they would be perfect absolutely.  ERNEST.  There is much virtue in that If, as Touchstone would say.  But do you seriously propose that every man should become his own Boswell? What would become of our industrious compilers of Lives and Recollections in that case?  GILBERT.  What has become of them?  They are the pest of the age, nothing more and nothing less.  Every great man nowadays has his disciples, and it is always Judas who writes the biography.  ERNEST.  My dear fellow!  GILBERT.  I am afraid it is true.  Formerly we used to canonise our heroes.  The modern method is to vulgarise them.  Cheap editions of great books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable.  ERNEST.  May I ask, Gilbert, to whom you allude?  GILBERT.  Oh! to all our second-rate _litt?rateurs_.  We are overrun by a set of people who, when poet or painter passes away, arrive at the house along with the undertaker, and forget that their one duty is to behave as mutes.  But we won?t talk about them.  They are the mere body-snatchers of literature.  The dust is given to one, and the ashes to another, and the soul is out of their reach.  And now, let me play Chopin to you, or Dvor?k?  Shall I play you a fantasy by Dvor?k?  He writes passionate, curiously-coloured things.  ERNEST.  No; I don?t want music just at present.  It is far too indefinite.  Besides, I took the Baroness Bernstein down to dinner last night, and, though absolutely charming in every other respect, she insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written in the German language.  Now, whatever music sounds like I am glad to say that it does not sound in the smallest degree like German.  There are forms of patriotism that are really quite degrading.  No; Gilbert, don?t play any more.  Turn round and talk to me.  Talk to me till the white-horned day comes into the room.  There is something in your voice that is wonderful.  GILBERT (_rising from the piano_).  I am not in a mood for talking to-night.  I really am not.  How horrid of you to smile!  Where are the cigarettes?  Thanks.  How exquisite these single daffodils are!  They seem to be made of amber and cool ivory.  They are like Greek things of the best period.  What was the story in the confessions of the remorseful Academician that made you laugh?  Tell it to me.  After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that were not my own.  Music always seems to me to produce that effect.  It creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant, and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one's tears.  I can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace life, hearing by chance some curious piece of music, and suddenly discovering that his soul, without his being conscious of it, had passed through terrible experiences, and known fearful joys, or wild romantic loves, or great renunciations.  And so tell me this story, Ernest.  I want to be amused.  ERNEST.  Oh!  I don?t know that it is of any importance.  But I thought it a really admirable illustration of the true value of ordinary art-criticism.  It seems that a lady once gravely asked the remorseful Academician, as you call him, if his celebrated picture of ?A Spring-Day at Whiteley's,? or, ?Waiting for the Last Omnibus,? or some subject of that kind, was all painted by hand?  GILBERT.  And was it?  ERNEST.  You are quite incorrigible.  But, seriously speaking, what is the use of art-criticism?  Why cannot the artist be left alone, to create a new world if he wishes it, or, if not, to shadow forth the world which we already know, and of which, I fancy, we would each one of us be wearied if Art, with her fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection, did not, as it were, purify it for us, and give to it a momentary perfection.  It seems to me that the imagination spreads, or should spread, a solitude around it, and works best in silence and in isolation.  Why should the artist be troubled by the shrill clamour of criticism?  Why should those who cannot create take upon themselves to estimate the value of creative work?  What can they know about it?  If a man's work is easy to understand, an explanation is unnecessary. . . .  GILBERT.  And if his work is incomprehensible, an explanation is wicked.  ERNEST.  I did not say that.  GILBERT.  Ah! but you should have.  Nowadays, we have so few mysteries left to us that we cannot afford to part with one of them.  The members of the Browning Society, like the theologians of the Broad Church Party, or the authors of Mr. Walter Scott's Great Writers Series, seem to me to spend their time in trying to explain their divinity away.  Where one had hoped that Browning was a mystic they have sought to show that he was simply inarticulate.  Where one had fancied that he had something to conceal, they have proved that he had but little to reveal.  But I speak merely of his incoherent work.  Taken as a whole the man was great.  He did not belong to the Olympians, and had all the incompleteness of the Titan.  He did not survey, and it was but rarely that he could sing.  His work is marred by struggle, violence and effort, and he passed not from emotion to form, but from thought to chaos.  Still, he was great.  He has been called a thinker, and was certainly a man who was always thinking, and always thinking aloud; but it was not thought that fascinated him, but rather the processes by which thought moves.  It was the machine he loved, not what the machine makes.  The method by which the fool arrives at his folly was as dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise.  So much, indeed, did the subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language, or looked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression.  Rhyme, that exquisite echo which in the Muse's hollow hill creates and answers its own voice; rhyme, which in the hands of the real artist becomes not merely a material element of metrical beauty, but a spiritual element of thought and passion also, waking a new mood, it may be, or stirring a fresh train of ideas, or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of sound some golden door at which the Imagination itself had knocked in vain; rhyme, which can turn man's utterance to the speech of gods; rhyme, the one chord we have added to the Greek lyre, became in Robert Browning's hands a grotesque, misshapen thing, which at times made him masquerade in poetry as a low comedian, and ride Pegasus too often with his tongue in his cheek.  There are moments when he wounds us by monstrous music.  Nay, if he can only get his music by breaking the strings of his lute, he breaks them, and they snap in discord, and no Athenian tettix, making melody from tremulous wings, lights on the ivory horn to make the movement perfect, or the interval less harsh.  Yet, he was great: and though he turned language into ignoble clay, he made from it men and women that live.  He is the most Shakespearian creature since Shakespeare.  If Shakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammer through a thousand mouths.  Even now, as I am speaking, and speaking not against him but for him, there glides through the room the pageant of his persons.  There, creeps Fra Lippo Lippi with his cheeks still burning from some girl's hot kiss.  There, stands dread Saul with the lordly male-sapphires gleaming in his turban.  Mildred Tresham is there, and the Spanish monk, yellow with hatred, and Blougram, and Ben Ezra, and the Bishop of St. Praxed's.  The spawn of Setebos gibbers in the corner, and Sebald, hearing Pippa pass by, looks on Ottima's haggard face, and loathes her and his own sin, and himself.  Pale as the white satin of his doublet, the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous eyes too loyal Strafford pass forth to his doom, and Andrea shudders as he hears the cousins whistle in the garden, and bids his perfect wife go down.  Yes, Browning was great.  And as what will he be remembered?  As a poet?  Ah, not as a poet!  He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled, and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least put problems forth, and what more should an artist do?  Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet.  Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him.  The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is George Meredith.  Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. He used poetry as a medium for writing in prose.  ERNEST.  There is something in what you say, but there is not everything in what you say.  In many points you are unjust.  GILBERT.  It is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves.  But let us return to the particular point at issue.  What was it that you said?  ERNEST.  Simply this: that in the best days of art there were no art-critics.  GILBERT.  I seem to have heard that observation before, Ernest.  It has all the vitality of error and all the tediousness of an old friend.  ERNEST.  It is true.  Yes: there is no use your tossing your head in that petulant manner.  It is quite true.  In the best days of art there were no art-critics.  The sculptor hewed from the marble block the great white-limbed Hermes that slept within it.  The waxers and gilders of images gave tone and texture to the statue, and the world, when it saw it, worshipped and was dumb.  He poured the glowing bronze into the mould of sand, and the river of red metal cooled into noble curves and took the impress of the body of a god.  With enamel or polished jewels he gave sight to the sightless eyes.  The hyacinth-like curls grew crisp beneath his graver.  And when, in some dim frescoed fane, or pillared sunlit portico, the child of Leto stood upon his pedestal, those who passed by, ??? ??????????? ????????? ????? ???????, became conscious of a new influence that had come across their lives, and dreamily, or with a sense of strange and quickening joy, went to their homes or daily labour, or wandered, it may be, through the city gates to that nymph-haunted meadow where young Ph?drus bathed his feet, and, lying there on the soft grass, beneath the tall wind?whispering planes and flowering _agnus castus_, began to think of the wonder of beauty, and grew silent with unaccustomed awe.  In those days the artist was free.  From the river valley he took the fine clay in his fingers, and with a little tool of wood or bone, fashioned it into forms so exquisite that the people gave them to the dead as their playthings, and we find them still in the dusty tombs on the yellow hillside by Tanagra, with the faint gold and the fading crimson still lingering about hair and lips and raiment.  On a wall of fresh plaster, stained with bright sandyx or mixed with milk and saffron, he pictured one who trod with tired feet the purple white-starred fields of asphodel, one ?in whose eyelids lay the whole of the Trojan War,? Polyxena, the daughter of Priam; or figured Odysseus, the wise and cunning, bound by tight cords to the mast-step, that he might listen without hurt to the singing of the Sirens, or wandering by the clear river of Acheron, where the ghosts of fishes flitted over the pebbly bed; or showed the Persian in trews and mitre flying before the Greek at Marathon, or the galleys clashing their beaks of brass in the little Salaminian bay.  He drew with silver-point and charcoal upon parchment and prepared cedar.  Upon ivory and rose-coloured terracotta he painted with wax, making the wax fluid with juice of olives, and with heated irons making it firm.  Panel and marble and linen canvas became wonderful as his brush swept across them; and life seeing her own image, was still, and dared not speak.  All life, indeed, was his, from the merchants seated in the market-place to the cloaked shepherd lying on the hill; from the nymph hidden in the laurels and the faun that pipes at noon, to the king whom, in long green-curtained litter, slaves bore upon oil-bright shoulders, and fanned with peacock fans.  Men and women, with pleasure or sorrow in their faces, passed before him.  He watched them, and their secret became his.  Through form and colour he re-created a world.  All subtle arts belonged to him also.  He held the gem against the revolving disk, and the amethyst became the purple couch for Adonis, and across the veined sardonyx sped Artemis with her hounds.  He beat out the gold into roses, and strung them together for necklace or armlet.  He beat out the gold into wreaths for the conqueror's helmet, or into palmates for the Tyrian robe, or into masks for the royal dead.  On the back of the silver mirror he graved Thetis borne by her Nereids, or love-sick Ph?dra with her nurse, or Persephone, weary of memory, putting poppies in her hair.  The potter sat in his shed, and, flower-like from the silent wheel, the vase rose up beneath his hands.  He decorated the base and stem and ears with pattern of dainty olive-leaf, or foliated acanthus, or curved and crested wave.  Then in black or red he painted lads wrestling, or in the race: knights in full armour, with strange heraldic shields and curious visors, leaning from shell-shaped chariot over rearing steeds: the gods seated at the feast or working their miracles: the heroes in their victory or in their pain.  Sometimes he would etch in thin vermilion lines upon a ground of white the languid bridegroom and his bride, with Eros hovering round them?an Eros like one of Donatello's angels, a little laughing thing with gilded or with azure wings.  On the curved side he would write the name of his friend.  ????? ?????????? or ????? ???????? tells us the story of his days.  Again, on the rim of the wide flat cup he would draw the stag browsing, or the lion at rest, as his fancy willed it.  From the tiny perfume-bottle laughed Aphrodite at her toilet, and, with bare-limbed M?nads in his train, Dionysus danced round the wine-jar on naked must-stained feet, while, satyr-like, the old Silenus sprawled upon the bloated skins, or shook that magic spear which was tipped with a fretted fir-cone, and wreathed with dark ivy.  And no one came to trouble the artist at his work.  No irresponsible chatter disturbed him.  He was not worried by opinions.  By the Ilyssus, says Arnold somewhere, there was no Higginbotham.  By the Ilyssus, my dear Gilbert, there were no silly art congresses bringing provincialism to the provinces and teaching the mediocrity how to mouth. By the Ilyssus there were no tedious magazines about art, in which the industrious prattle of what they do not understand.  On the reed-grown banks of that little stream strutted no ridiculous journalism monopolising the seat of judgment when it should be apologising in the dock.  The Greeks had no art-critics.  GILBERT.  Ernest, you are quite delightful, but your views are terribly unsound.  I am afraid that you have been listening to the conversation of some one older than yourself.  That is always a dangerous thing to do, and if you allow it to degenerate into a habit you will find it absolutely fatal to any intellectual development.  As for modern journalism, it is not my business to defend it.  It justifies its own existence by the great Darwinian principle of the survival of the vulgarest.  I have merely to do with literature.  ERNEST.  But what is the difference between literature and journalism?  GILBERT.  Oh! journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read.  That is all.  But with regard to your statement that the Greeks had no art-critics, I assure you that is quite absurd.  It would be more just to say that the Greeks were a nation of art-critics.  ERNEST.  Really?  GILBERT.  Yes, a nation of art-critics.  But I don?t wish to destroy the delightfully unreal picture that you have drawn of the relation of the Hellenic artist to the intellectual spirit of his age.  To give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian, but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture.  Still less do I desire to talk learnedly.  Learned conversation is either the affectation of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed.  And, as for what is called improving conversation, that is merely the foolish method by which the still more foolish philanthropist feebly tries to disarm the just rancour of the criminal classes.  No: let me play to you some mad scarlet thing by Dvor?k.  The pallid figures on the tapestry are smiling at us, and the heavy eyelids of my bronze Narcissus are folded in sleep.  Don?t let us discuss anything solemnly.  I am but too conscious of the fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treated seriously, and I live in terror of not being misunderstood.  Don?t degrade me into the position of giving you useful information.  Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.  Through the parted curtains of the window I see the moon like a clipped piece of silver.  Like gilded bees the stars cluster round her.  The sky is a hard hollow sapphire.  Let us go out into the night.  Thought is wonderful, but adventure is more wonderful still.  Who knows but we may meet Prince Florizel of Bohemia, and hear the fair Cuban tell us that she is not what she seems?  ERNEST.  You are horribly wilful.  I insist on your discussing this matter with me.  You have said that the Greeks were a nation of art-critics.  What art-criticism have they left us?  GILBERT.  My dear Ernest, even if not a single fragment of art-criticism had come down to us from Hellenic or Hellenistic days, it would be none the less true that the Greeks were a nation of art-critics, and that they invented the criticism of art just as they invented the criticism of everything else.  For, after all, what is our primary debt to the Greeks? Simply the critical spirit.  And, this spirit, which they exercised on questions of religion and science, of ethics and metaphysics, of politics and education, they exercised on questions of art also, and, indeed, of the two supreme and highest arts, they have left us the most flawless system of criticism that the world has ever seen.  ERNEST.  But what are the two supreme and highest arts?  GILBERT.  Life and Literature, life and the perfect expression of life. The principles of the former, as laid down by the Greeks, we may not realise in an age so marred by false ideals as our own.  The principles of the latter, as they laid them down, are, in many cases, so subtle that we can hardly understand them.  Recognising that the most perfect art is that which most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety, they elaborated the criticism of language, considered in the light of the mere material of that art, to a point to which we, with our accentual system of reasonable or emotional emphasis, can barely if at all attain; studying, for instance, the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a modern musician studies harmony and counterpoint, and, I need hardly say, with much keener 'sthetic instinct.  In this they were right, as they were right in all things.  Since the introduction of printing, and the fatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower classes of this country, there has been a tendency in literature to appeal more and more to the eye, and less and less to the ear which is really the sense which, from the standpoint of pure art, it should seek to please, and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always.  Even the work of Mr. Pater, who is, on the whole, the most perfect master of English prose now creating amongst us, is often far more like a piece of mosaic than a passage in music, and seems, here and there, to lack the true rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect that such rhythmical life produces.  We, in fact, have made writing a definite mode of composition, and have treated it as a form of elaborate design.  The Greeks, upon the other hand, regarded writing simply as a method of chronicling.  Their test was always the spoken word in its musical and metrical relations.  The voice was the medium, and the ear the critic.  I have sometimes thought that the story of Homer's blindness might be really an artistic myth, created in critical days, and serving to remind us, not merely that the great poet is always a seer, seeing less with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul, but that he is a true singer also, building his song out of music, repeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the secret of its melody, chaunting in darkness the words that are winged with light.  Certainly, whether this be so or not, it was to his blindness, as an occasion, if not as a cause, that England's great poet owed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later verse.  When Milton could no longer write he began to sing.  Who would match the measures of _Comus_ with the measures of _Samson Agonistes_, or of _Paradise Lost_ or _Regained_?  When Milton became blind he composed, as every one should compose, with the voice purely, and so the pipe or reed of earlier days became that mighty many-stopped organ whose rich reverberant music has all the stateliness of Homeric verse, if it seeks not to have its swiftness, and is the one imperishable inheritance of English literature sweeping through all the ages, because above them, and abiding with us ever, being immortal in its form.  Yes: writing has done much harm to writers.  We must return to the voice.  That must be our test, and perhaps then we shall be able to appreciate some of the subtleties of Greek art-criticism.  As it now is, we cannot do so.  Sometimes, when I have written a piece of prose that I have been modest enough to consider absolutely free from fault, a dreadful thought comes over me that I may have been guilty of the immoral effeminacy of using trochaic and tribrachic movements, a crime for which a learned critic of the Augustan age censures with most just severity the brilliant if somewhat paradoxical Hegesias.  I grow cold when I think of it, and wonder to myself if the admirable ethical effect of the prose of that charming writer, who once in a spirit of reckless generosity towards the uncultivated portion of our community proclaimed the monstrous doctrine that conduct is three-fourths of life, will not some day be entirely annihilated by the discovery that the p?ons have been wrongly placed.  ERNEST.  Ah! now you are flippant.  GILBERT.  Who would not be flippant when he is gravely told that the Greeks had no art-critics?  I can understand it being said that the constructive genius of the Greeks lost itself in criticism, but not that the race to whom we owe the critical spirit did not criticise.  You will not ask me to give you a survey of Greek art criticism from Plato to Plotinus.  The night is too lovely for that, and the moon, if she heard us, would put more ashes on her face than are there already.  But think merely of one perfect little work of 'sthetic criticism, Aristotle's _Treatise on Poetry_.  It is not perfect in form, for it is badly written, consisting perhaps of notes dotted down for an art lecture, or of isolated fragments destined for some larger book, but in temper and treatment it is perfect, absolutely.  The ethical effect of art, its importance to culture, and its place in the formation of character, had been done once for all by Plato; but here we have art treated, not from the moral, but from the purely 'sthetic point of view.  Plato had, of course, dealt with many definitely artistic subjects, such as the importance of unity in a work of art, the necessity for tone an|2
63|d harmony, the 'sthetic value of appearances, the relation of the visible arts to the external world, and the relation of fiction to fact.  He first perhaps stirred in the soul of man that desire that we have not yet satisfied, the desire to know the connection between Beauty and Truth, and the place of Beauty in the moral and intellectual order of the Kosmos.  The problems of idealism and realism, as he sets them forth, may seem to many to be somewhat barren of result in the metaphysical sphere of abstract being in which he places them, but transfer them to the sphere of art, and you will find that they are still vital and full of meaning.  It may be that it is as a critic of Beauty that Plato is destined to live, and that by altering the name of the sphere of his speculation we shall find a new philosophy.  But Aristotle, like Goethe, deals with art primarily in its concrete manifestations, taking Tragedy, for instance, and investigating the material it uses, which is language, its subject-matter, which is life, the method by which it works, which is action, the conditions under which it reveals itself, which are those of theatric presentation, its logical structure, which is plot, and its final 'sthetic appeal, which is to the sense of beauty realised through the passions of pity and awe.  That purification and spiritualising of the nature which he calls ???????? is, as Goethe saw, essentially 'sthetic, and is not moral, as Lessing fancied.  Concerning himself primarily with the impression that the work of art produces, Aristotle sets himself to analyse that impression, to investigate its source, to see how it is engendered.  As a physiologist and psychologist, he knows that the health of a function resides in energy.  To have a capacity for a passion and not to realise it, is to make oneself incomplete and limited.  The mimic spectacle of life that Tragedy affords cleanses the bosom of much ?perilous stuff,? and by presenting high and worthy objects for the exercise of the emotions purifies and spiritualises the man; nay, not merely does it spiritualise him, but it initiates him also into noble feelings of which he might else have known nothing, the word ???????? having, it has sometimes seemed to me, a definite allusion to the rite of initiation, if indeed that be not, as I am occasionally tempted to fancy, its true and only meaning here.  This is of course a mere outline of the book.  But you see what a perfect piece of 'sthetic criticism it is.  Who indeed but a Greek could have analysed art so well?  After reading it, one does not wonder any longer that Alexandria devoted itself so largely to art-criticism, and that we find the artistic temperaments of the day investigating every question of style and manner, discussing the great Academic schools of painting, for instance, such as the school of Sicyon, that sought to preserve the dignified traditions of the antique mode, or the realistic and impressionist schools, that aimed at reproducing actual life, or the elements of ideality in portraiture, or the artistic value of the epic form in an age so modern as theirs, or the proper subject-matter for the artist.  Indeed, I fear that the inartistic temperaments of the day busied themselves also in matters of literature and art, for the accusations of plagiarism were endless, and such accusations proceed either from the thin colourless lips of impotence, or from the grotesque mouths of those who, possessing nothing of their own, fancy that they can gain a reputation for wealth by crying out that they have been robbed.  And I assure you, my dear Ernest, that the Greeks chattered about painters quite as much as people do nowadays, and had their private views, and shilling exhibitions, and Arts and Crafts guilds, and Pre-Raphaelite movements, and movements towards realism, and lectured about art, and wrote essays on art, and produced their art-historians, and their arch?ologists, and all the rest of it.  Why, even the theatrical managers of travelling companies brought their dramatic critics with them when they went on tour, and paid them very handsome salaries for writing laudatory notices.  Whatever, in fact, is modern in our life we owe to the Greeks.  Whatever is an anachronism is due to medi?valism.  It is the Greeks who have given us the whole system of art-criticism, and how fine their critical instinct was, may be seen from the fact that the material they criticised with most care was, as I have already said, language.  For the material that painter or sculptor uses is meagre in comparison with that of words.  Words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute, colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the Venetian or the Spaniard, and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze, but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs also, are theirs indeed alone.  If the Greeks had criticised nothing but language, they would still have been the great art-critics of the world. To know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of all the arts.  But I see that the moon is hiding behind a sulphur-coloured cloud.  Out of a tawny mane of drift she gleams like a lion's eye.  She is afraid that I will talk to you of Lucian and Longinus, of Quinctilian and Dionysius, of Pliny and Fronto and Pausanias, of all those who in the antique world wrote or lectured upon art matters.  She need not be afraid.  I am tired of my expedition into the dim, dull abyss of facts. There is nothing left for me now but the divine ?????????? ????? of another cigarette.  Cigarettes have at least the charm of leaving one unsatisfied.  ERNEST.  Try one of mine.  They are rather good.  I get them direct from Cairo.  The only use of our _attach's_ is that they supply their friends with excellent tobacco.  And as the moon has hidden herself, let us talk a little longer.  I am quite ready to admit that I was wrong in what I said about the Greeks.  They were, as you have pointed out, a nation of art-critics.  I acknowledge it, and I feel a little sorry for them.  For the creative faculty is higher than the critical.  There is really no comparison between them.  GILBERT.  The antithesis between them is entirely arbitrary.  Without the critical faculty, there is no artistic creation at all, worthy of the name.  You spoke a little while ago of that fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection by which the artist realises life for us, and gives to it a momentary perfection.  Well, that spirit of choice, that subtle tact of omission, is really the critical faculty in one of its most characteristic moods, and no one who does not possess this critical faculty can create anything at all in art.  Arnold's definition of literature as a criticism of life was not very felicitous in form, but it showed how keenly he recognised the importance of the critical element in all creative work.  ERNEST.  I should have said that great artists work unconsciously, that they were ?wiser than they knew,? as, I think, Emerson remarks somewhere.  GILBERT.  It is really not so, Ernest.  All fine imaginative work is self-conscious and deliberate.  No poet sings because he must sing.  At least, no great poet does.  A great poet sings because he chooses to sing.  It is so now, and it has always been so.  We are sometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn of poetry were simpler, fresher, and more natural than ours, and that the world which the early poets looked at, and through which they walked, had a kind of poetical quality of its own, and almost without changing could pass into song. The snow lies thick now upon Olympus, and its steep scarped sides are bleak and barren, but once, we fancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning, and at evening came Apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale.  But in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire, or think we desire, for our own.  Our historical sense is at fault.  Every century that produces poetry is, so far, an artificial century, and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most self-conscious effort.  Believe me, Ernest, there is no fine art without self-consciousness, and self-consciousness and the critical spirit are one.  ERNEST.  I see what you mean, and there is much in it.  But surely you would admit that the great poems of the early world, the primitive, anonymous collective poems, were the result of the imagination of races, rather than of the imagination of individuals?  GILBERT.  Not when they became poetry.  Not when they received a beautiful form.  For there is no art where there is no style, and no style where there is no unity, and unity is of the individual.  No doubt Homer had old ballads and stories to deal with, as Shakespeare had chronicles and plays and novels from which to work, but they were merely his rough material.  He took them, and shaped them into song.  They become his, because he made them lovely.  They were built out of music,         And so not built at all,     And therefore built for ever.  The longer one studies life and literature, the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual, and that it is not the moment that makes the man, but the man who creates the age. Indeed, I am inclined to think that each myth and legend that seems to us to spring out of the wonder, or terror, or fancy of tribe and nation, was in its origin the invention of one single mind.  The curiously limited number of the myths seems to me to point to this conclusion.  But we must not go off into questions of comparative mythology.  We must keep to criticism.  And what I want to point out is this.  An age that has no criticism is either an age in which art is immobile, hieratic, and confined to the reproduction of formal types, or an age that possesses no art at all.  There have been critical ages that have not been creative, in the ordinary sense of the word, ages in which the spirit of man has sought to set in order the treasures of his treasure-house, to separate the gold from the silver, and the silver from the lead, to count over the jewels, and to give names to the pearls.  But there has never been a creative age that has not been critical also.  For it is the critical faculty that invents fresh forms.  The tendency of creation is to repeat itself.  It is to the critical instinct that we owe each new school that springs up, each new mould that art finds ready to its hand.  There is really not a single form that art now uses that does not come to us from the critical spirit of Alexandria, where these forms were either stereotyped or invented or made perfect.  I say Alexandria, not merely because it was there that the Greek spirit became most self-conscious, and indeed ultimately expired in scepticism and theology, but because it was to that city, and not to Athens, that Rome turned for her models, and it was through the survival, such as it was, of the Latin language that culture lived at all.  When, at the Renaissance, Greek literature dawned upon Europe, the soil had been in some measure prepared for it.  But, to get rid of the details of history, which are always wearisome and usually inaccurate, let us say generally, that the forms of art have been due to the Greek critical spirit.  To it we owe the epic, the lyric, the entire drama in every one of its developments, including burlesque, the idyll, the romantic novel, the novel of adventure, the essay, the dialogue, the oration, the lecture, for which perhaps we should not forgive them, and the epigram, in all the wide meaning of that word.  In fact, we owe it everything, except the sonnet, to which, however, some curious parallels of thought-movement may be traced in the Anthology, American journalism, to which no parallel can be found anywhere, and the ballad in sham Scotch dialect, which one of our most industrious writers has recently proposed should be made the basis for a final and unanimous effort on the part of our second-rate poets to make themselves really romantic.  Each new school, as it appears, cries out against criticism, but it is to the critical faculty in man that it owes its origin.  The mere creative instinct does not innovate, but reproduces.  ERNEST.  You have been talking of criticism as an essential part of the creative spirit, and I now fully accept your theory.  But what of criticism outside creation?  I have a foolish habit of reading periodicals, and it seems to me that most modern criticism is perfectly valueless.  GILBERT.  So is most modern creative work also.  Mediocrity weighing mediocrity in the balance, and incompetence applauding its brother?that is the spectacle which the artistic activity of England affords us from time to time.  And yet, I feel I am a little unfair in this matter.  As a rule, the critics?I speak, of course, of the higher class, of those in fact who write for the sixpenny papers?are far more cultured than the people whose work they are called upon to review.  This is, indeed, only what one would expect, for criticism demands infinitely more cultivation than creation does.  ERNEST.  Really?  GILBERT.  Certainly.  Anybody can write a three-volumed novel.  It merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature.  The difficulty that I should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of sustaining any standard.  Where there is no style a standard must be impossible.  The poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the reporters of the police-court of literature, the chroniclers of the doings of the habitual criminals of art.  It is sometimes said of them that they do not read all through the works they are called upon to criticise.  They do not.  Or at least they should not.  If they did so, they would become confirmed misanthropes, or if I may borrow a phrase from one of the pretty Newnham graduates, confirmed womanthropes for the rest of their lives.  Nor is it necessary.  To know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask.  It must be perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or worth nothing.  Ten minutes are really sufficient, if one has the instinct for form.  Who wants to wade through a dull volume?  One tastes it, and that is quite enough?more than enough, I should imagine.  I am aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in literature who object to criticism entirely.  They are quite right. Their work stands in no intellectual relation to their age.  It brings us no new element of pleasure.  It suggests no fresh departure of thought, or passion, or beauty.  It should not be spoken of.  It should be left to the oblivion that it deserves.  ERNEST.  But, my dear fellow?excuse me for interrupting you?you seem to me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too far.  For, after all, even you must admit that it is much more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it.  GILBERT.  More difficult to do a thing than to talk about it?  Not at all.  That is a gross popular error.  It is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it.  In the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious.  Anybody can make history.  Only a great man can write it.  There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals.  It is only by language that we rise above them, or above each other?by language, which is the parent, and not the child, of thought.  Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in its most aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to be that of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatsoever to do.  No, Ernest, don?t talk about action.  It is a blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by an impulse of whose nature it is unconscious.  It is a thing incomplete in its essence, because limited by accident, and ignorant of its direction, being always at variance with its aim.  Its basis is the lack of imagination.  It is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.  ERNEST.  Gilbert, you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball.  You hold it in your hand, and reverse it to please a wilful fancy.  You do nothing but re-write history.  GILBERT.  The one duty we owe to history is to re-write it.  That is not the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit.  When we have fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life, we shall realise that the one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of action.  He, indeed, knows neither the origin of his deeds nor their results.  From the field in which he thought that he had sown thorns, we have gathered our vintage, and the fig-tree that he planted for our pleasure is as barren as the thistle, and more bitter.  It is because Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way.  ERNEST.  You think, then, that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is a delusion?  GILBERT.  It is worse than a delusion.  If we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse, and those whom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy.  Each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless, or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation, more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before.  But men are the slaves of words.  They rage against Materialism, as they call it, forgetting that there has been no material improvement that has not spiritualised the world, and that there have been few, if any, spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the world's faculties in barren hopes, and fruitless aspirations, and empty or trammelling creeds. What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress.  Without it the world would stagnate, or grow old, or become colourless.  By its curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race.  Through its intensified assertion of individualism, it saves us from monotony of type.  In its rejection of the current notions about morality, it is one with the higher ethics.  And as for the virtues!  What are the virtues? Nature, M. Renan tells us, cares little about chastity, and it may be that it is to the shame of the Magdalen, and not to their own purity, that the Lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain.  Charity, as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge, creates a multitude of evils.  The mere existence of conscience, that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays, and are so ignorantly proud, is a sign of our imperfect development.  It must be merged in instinct before we become fine. Self-denial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress, and self-sacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage, part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world, and which even now makes its victims day by day, and has its altars in the land.  Virtues!  Who knows what the virtues are?  Not you. Not I.  Not any one.  It is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime.  It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom.  He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest.  ERNEST.  Gilbert, you sound too harsh a note.  Let us go back to the more gracious fields of literature.  What was it you said?  That it was more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it?  GILBERT (_after a pause_).  Yes: I believe I ventured upon that simple truth.  Surely you see now that I am right?  When man acts he is a puppet.  When he describes he is a poet.  The whole secret lies in that. It was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy Ilion to send the notched arrow from the painted bow, or to hurl against the shield of hide and flamelike brass the long ash-handled spear.  It was easy for the adulterous queen to spread the Tyrian carpets for her lord, and then, as he lay couched in the marble bath, to throw over his head the purple net, and call to her smooth-faced lover to stab through the meshes at the heart that should have broken at Aulis.  For Antigone even, with Death waiting for her as her bridegroom, it was easy to pass through the tainted air at noon, and climb the hill, and strew with kindly earth the wretched naked corse that had no tomb.  But what of those who wrote about these things?  What of those who gave them reality, and made them live for ever?  Are they not greater than the men and women they sing of? ?Hector that sweet knight is dead,? and Lucian tells us how in the dim under-world Menippus saw the bleaching skull of Helen, and marvelled that it was for so grim a favour that all those horned ships were launched, those beautiful mailed men laid low, those towered cities brought to dust.  Yet, every day the swanlike daughter of Leda comes out on the battlements, and looks down at the tide of war.  The greybeards wonder at her loveliness, and she stands by the side of the king.  In his chamber of stained ivory lies her leman.  He is polishing his dainty armour, and combing the scarlet plume.  With squire and page, her husband passes from tent to tent.  She can see his bright hair, and hears, or fancies that she hears, that clear cold voice.  In the courtyard below, the son of Priam is buckling on his brazen cuirass.  The white arms of Andromache are around his neck.  He sets his helmet on the ground, lest their babe should be frightened.  Behind the embroidered curtains of his pavilion sits Achilles, in perfumed raiment, while in harness of gilt and silver the friend of his soul arrays himself to go forth to the fight.  From a curiously carven chest that his mother Thetis had brought to his ship-side, the Lord of the Myrmidons takes out that mystic chalice that the lip of man had never touched, and cleanses it with brimstone, and with fresh water cools it, and, having washed his hands, fills with black wine its burnished hollow, and spills the thick grape-blood upon the ground in honour of Him whom at Dodona barefooted prophets worshipped, and prays to Him, and knows not that he prays in vain, and that by the hands of two knights from Troy, Panthous? son, Euphorbus, whose love-locks were looped with gold, and the Priamid, the lion-hearted, Patroklus, the comrade of comrades, must meet his doom.  Phantoms, are they?  Heroes of mist and mountain?  Shadows in a song?  No: they are real.  Action!  What is action?  It dies at the moment of its energy.  It is a base concession to fact.  The world is made by the singer for the dreamer.  ERNEST.  While you talk it seems to me to be so.  GILBERT.  It is so in truth.  On the mouldering citadel of Troy lies the lizard like a thing of green bronze.  The owl has built her nest in the palace of Priam.  Over the empty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks, and where, on the wine-surfaced, oily sea, ????? ??????, as Homer calls it, copper-prowed and streaked with vermilion, the great galleys of the Danaoi came in their gleaming crescent, the lonely tunny-fisher sits in his little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net.  Yet, every morning the doors of the city are thrown open, and on foot, or in horse-drawn chariot, the warriors go forth to battle, and mock their enemies from behind their iron masks.  All day long the fight rages, and when night comes the torches gleam by the tents, and the cresset burns in the hall.  Those who live in marble or on painted panel, know of life but a single exquisite instant, eternal indeed in its beauty, but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm.  Those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror, of courage and despair, of pleasure and of suffering.  The seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant, and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them.  They have their youth and their manhood, they are children, and they grow old.  It is always dawn for St. Helena, as Veronese saw her at the window.  Through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of God's pain.  The cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow.  On that little hill by the city of Florence, where the lovers of Giorgione are lying, it is always the solstice of noon, of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass, and the long fingers of the lute-player rest idly upon the chords.  It is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom Corot set free among the silver poplars of France.  In eternal twilight they move, those frail diaphanous figures, whose tremulous white feet seem not to touch the dew-drenched grass they tread on.  But those who walk in epos, drama, or romance, see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane, and watch the night from evening unto morning star, and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow.  For them, as for us, the flowers bloom and wither, and the Earth, that Green-tressed Goddess as Coleridge calls her, alters her raiment for their pleasure.  The statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection.  The image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change.  If they know nothing of death, it is because they know little of life, for the secrets of life and death belong to those, and those only, whom the sequence of time affects, and who possess not merely the present but the future, and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame.  Movement, that problem of the visible arts, can be truly realised by Literature alone.  It is Literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest.  ERNEST.  Yes; I see now what you mean.  But, surely, the higher you place the creative artist, the lower must the critic rank.  GILBERT.  Why so?  ERNEST.  Because the best that he can give us will be but an echo of rich music, a dim shadow of clear-outlined form.  It may, indeed, be that life is chaos, as you tell me that it is; that its martyrdoms are mean and its heroisms ignoble; and that it is the function of Literature to create, from the rough material of actual existence, a new world that will be more marvellous, more enduring, and more true than the world that common eyes look upon, and through which common natures seek to realise their perfection.  But surely, if this new world has been made by the spirit and touch of a great artist, it will be a thing so complete and perfect that there will be nothing left for the critic to do.  I quite understand now, and indeed admit most readily, that it is far more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it.  But it seems to me that this sound and sensible maxim, which is really extremely soothing to one's feelings, and should be adopted as its motto by every Academy of Literature all over the world, applies only to the relations that exist between Art and Life, and not to any relations that there may be between Art and Criticism.  GILBERT.  But, surely, Criticism is itself an art.  And just as artistic creation implies the working of the critical faculty, and, indeed, without it cannot be said to exist at all, so Criticism is really creative in the highest sense of the word.  Criticism is, in fact, both creative and independent.  ERNEST.  Independent?  GILBERT.  Yes; independent.  Criticism is no more to be judged by any low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work of poet or sculptor.  The critic occupies the same relation to the work of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visible world of form and colour, or the unseen world of passion and of thought.  He does not even require for the perfection of his art the finest materials.  Anything will serve his purpose.  And just as out of the sordid and sentimental amours of the silly wife of a small country doctor in the squalid village of Yonville-l?Abbaye, near Rouen, Gustave Flaubert was able to create a classic, and make a masterpiece of style, so, from subjects of little or of no importance, such as the pictures in this year's Ro|2
64|yal Academy, or in any year's Royal Academy for that matter, Mr. Lewis Morris's poems, M. Ohnet's novels, or the plays of Mr. Henry Arthur Jones, the true critic can, if it be his pleasure so to direct or waste his faculty of contemplation, produce work that will be flawless in beauty and instinct with intellectual subtlety.  Why not?  Dulness is always an irresistible temptation for brilliancy, and stupidity is the permanent _Bestia Trionfans_ that calls wisdom from its cave.  To an artist so creative as the critic, what does subject-matter signify?  No more and no less than it does to the novelist and the painter.  Like them, he can find his motives everywhere.  Treatment is the test.  There is nothing that has not in it suggestion or challenge.  ERNEST.  But is Criticism really a creative art?  GILBERT.  Why should it not be?  It works with materials, and puts them into a form that is at once new and delightful.  What more can one say of poetry?  Indeed, I would call criticism a creation within a creation. For just as the great artists, from Homer and 'schylus, down to Shakespeare and Keats, did not go directly to life for their subject-matter, but sought for it in myth, and legend, and ancient tale, so the critic deals with materials that others have, as it were, purified for him, and to which imaginative form and colour have been already added.  Nay, more, I would say that the highest Criticism, being the purest form of personal impression, is in its way more creative than creation, as it has least reference to any standard external to itself, and is, in fact, its own reason for existing, and, as the Greeks would put it, in itself, and to itself, an end.  Certainly, it is never trammelled by any shackles of verisimilitude.  No ignoble considerations of probability, that cowardly concession to the tedious repetitions of domestic or public life, affect it ever.  One may appeal from fiction unto fact.  But from the soul there is no appeal.  ERNEST.  From the soul?  GILBERT.  Yes, from the soul.  That is what the highest criticism really is, the record of one's own soul.  It is more fascinating than history, as it is concerned simply with oneself.  It is more delightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and not abstract, real and not vague.  It is the only civilised form of autobiography, as it deals not with the events, but with the thoughts of one's life; not with life's physical accidents of deed or circumstance, but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind.  I am always amused by the silly vanity of those writers and artists of our day who seem to imagine that the primary function of the critic is to chatter about their second-rate work.  The best that one can say of most modern creative art is that it is just a little less vulgar than reality, and so the critic, with his fine sense of distinction and sure instinct of delicate refinement, will prefer to look into the silver mirror or through the woven veil, and will turn his eyes away from the chaos and clamour of actual existence, though the mirror be tarnished and the veil be torn.  His sole aim is to chronicle his own impressions.  It is for him that pictures are painted, books written, and marble hewn into form.  ERNEST.  I seem to have heard another theory of Criticism.  GILBERT.  Yes: it has been said by one whose gracious memory we all revere, and the music of whose pipe once lured Proserpina from her Sicilian fields, and made those white feet stir, and not in vain, the Cumnor cowslips, that the proper aim of Criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is.  But this is a very serious error, and takes no cognisance of Criticism's most perfect form, which is in its essence purely subjective, and seeks to reveal its own secret and not the secret of another.  For the highest Criticism deals with art not as expressive but as impressive purely.  ERNEST.  But is that really so?  GILBERT.  Of course it is.  Who cares whether Mr. Ruskin's views on Turner are sound or not?  What does it matter?  That mighty and majestic prose of his, so fervid and so fiery-coloured in its noble eloquence, so rich in its elaborate symphonic music, so sure and certain, at its best, in subtle choice of word and epithet, is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in England's Gallery; greater indeed, one is apt to think at times, not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring, but on account of the fuller variety of its appeal, soul speaking to soul in those long-cadenced lines, not through form and colour alone, though through these, indeed, completely and without loss, but with intellectual and emotional utterance, with lofty passion and with loftier thought, with imaginative insight, and with poetic aim; greater, I always think, even as Literature is the greater art.  Who, again, cares whether Mr. Pater has put into the portrait of Monna Lisa something that Lionardo never dreamed of?  The painter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile, as some have fancied, but whenever I pass into the cool galleries of the Palace of the Louvre, and stand before that strange figure 'set in its marble chair in that cirque of fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea,? I murmur to myself, ?She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her: and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants; and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as St. Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands.?  And I say to my friend, ?The presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to desire?; and he answers me, ?Hers is the head upon which all ?the ends of the world are come,? and the eyelids are a little weary.?  And so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is, and reveals to us a secret of which, in truth, it knows nothing, and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that flute-player's music that lent to the lips of La Gioconda those subtle and poisonous curves.  Do you ask me what Lionardo would have said had any one told him of this picture that ?all the thoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to refine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the Middle Age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias??  He would probably have answered that he had contemplated none of these things, but had concerned himself simply with certain arrangements of lines and masses, and with new and curious colour-harmonies of blue and green.  And it is for this very reason that the criticism which I have quoted is criticism of the highest kind.  It treats the work of art simply as a starting-point for a new creation.  It does not confine itself?let us at least suppose so for the moment?to discovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final. And in this it is right, for the meaning of any beautiful created thing is, at least, as much in the soul of him who looks at it, as it was in his soul who wrought it.  Nay, it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and sets it in some new relation to the age, so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives, and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of what, having prayed for, we fear that we may receive.  The longer I study, Ernest, the more clearly I see that the beauty of the visible arts is, as the beauty of music, impressive primarily, and that it may be marred, and indeed often is so, by any excess of intellectual intention on the part of the artist.  For when the work is finished it has, as it were, an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say.  Sometimes, when I listen to the overture to _Tannh?user_, I seem indeed to see that comely knight treading delicately on the flower-strewn grass, and to hear the voice of Venus calling to him from the caverned hill.  But at other times it speaks to me of a thousand different things, of myself, it may be, and my own life, or of the lives of others whom one has loved and grown weary of loving, or of the passions that man has known, or of the passions that man has not known, and so has sought for.  To-night it may fill one with that ???? ??? ????????, that _Amour de l?Impossible_, which falls like a madness on many who think they live securely and out of reach of harm, so that they sicken suddenly with the poison of unlimited desire, and, in the infinite pursuit of what they may not obtain, grow faint and swoon or stumble.  To-morrow, like the music of which Aristotle and Plato tell us, the noble Dorian music of the Greek, it may perform the office of a physician, and give us an anodyne against pain, and heal the spirit that is wounded, and ?bring the soul into harmony with all right things.?  And what is true about music is true about all the arts.  Beauty has as many meanings as man has moods.  Beauty is the symbol of symbols.  Beauty reveals everything, because it expresses nothing.  When it shows us itself, it shows us the whole fiery-coloured world.  ERNEST.  But is such work as you have talked about really criticism?  GILBERT.  It is the highest Criticism, for it criticises not merely the individual work of art, but Beauty itself, and fills with wonder a form which the artist may have left void, or not understood, or understood incompletely.  ERNEST.  The highest Criticism, then, is more creative than creation, and the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not; that is your theory, I believe?  GILBERT.  Yes, that is my theory.  To the critic the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own, that need not necessarily bear any obvious resemblance to the thing it criticises.  The one characteristic of a beautiful form is that one can put into it whatever one wishes, and see in it whatever one chooses to see; and the Beauty, that gives to creation its universal and 'sthetic element, makes the critic a creator in his turn, and whispers of a thousand different things which were not present in the mind of him who carved the statue or painted the panel or graved the gem.  It is sometimes said by those who understand neither the nature of the highest Criticism nor the charm of the highest Art, that the pictures that the critic loves most to write about are those that belong to the anecdotage of painting, and that deal with scenes taken out of literature or history.  But this is not so.  Indeed, pictures of this kind are far too intelligible.  As a class, they rank with illustrations, and, even considered from this point of view are failures, as they do not stir the imagination, but set definite bounds to it.  For the domain of the painter is, as I suggested before, widely different from that of the poet.  To the latter belongs life in its full and absolute entirety; not merely the beauty that men look at, but the beauty that men listen to also; not merely the momentary grace of form or the transient gladness of colour, but the whole sphere of feeling, the perfect cycle of thought. The painter is so far limited that it is only through the mask of the body that he can show us the mystery of the soul; only through conventional images that he can handle ideas; only through its physical equivalents that he can deal with psychology.  And how inadequately does he do it then, asking us to accept the torn turban of the Moor for the noble rage of Othello, or a dotard in a storm for the wild madness of Lear!  Yet it seems as if nothing could stop him.  Most of our elderly English painters spend their wicked and wasted lives in poaching upon the domain of the poets, marring their motives by clumsy treatment, and striving to render, by visible form or colour, the marvel of what is invisible, the splendour of what is not seen.  Their pictures are, as a natural consequence, insufferably tedious.  They have degraded the invisible arts into the obvious arts, and the one thing not worth looking at is the obvious.  I do not say that poet and painter may not treat of the same subject.  They have always done so and will always do so.  But while the poet can be pictorial or not, as he chooses, the painter must be pictorial always.  For a painter is limited, not to what he sees in nature, but to what upon canvas may be seen.  And so, my dear Ernest, pictures of this kind will not really fascinate the critic.  He will turn from them to such works as make him brood and dream and fancy, to works that possess the subtle quality of suggestion, and seem to tell one that even from them there is an escape into a wider world.  It is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artist's life is that he cannot realise his ideal.  But the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely.  For, when the ideal is realised, it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, and becomes simply a new starting-point for an ideal that is other than itself.  This is the reason why music is the perfect type of art.  Music can never reveal its ultimate secret.  This, also, is the explanation of the value of limitations in art.  The sculptor gladly surrenders imitative colour, and the painter the actual dimensions of form, because by such renunciations they are able to avoid too definite a presentation of the Real, which would be mere imitation, and too definite a realisation of the Ideal, which would be too purely intellectual.  It is through its very incompleteness that art becomes complete in beauty, and so addresses itself, not to the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of reason, but to the 'sthetic sense alone, which, while accepting both reason and recognition as stages of apprehension, subordinates them both to a pure synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole, and, taking whatever alien emotional elements the work may possess, uses their very complexity as a means by which a richer unity may be added to the ultimate impression itself.  You see, then, how it is that the 'sthetic critic rejects these obvious modes of art that have but one message to deliver, and having delivered it become dumb and sterile, and seeks rather for such modes as suggest reverie and mood, and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true, and no interpretation final.  Some resemblance, no doubt, the creative work of the critic will have to the work that has stirred him to creation, but it will be such resemblance as exists, not between Nature and the mirror that the painter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her, but between Nature and the work of the decorative artist.  Just as on the flowerless carpets of Persia, tulip and rose blossom indeed and are lovely to look on, though they are not reproduced in visible shape or line; just as the pearl and purple of the sea-shell is echoed in the church of St. Mark at Venice; just as the vaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at Ravenna is made gorgeous by the gold and green and sapphire of the peacock's tail, though the birds of Juno fly not across it; so the critic reproduces the work that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative, and part of whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance, and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also the mystery of Beauty, and, by transforming each art into literature, solves once for all the problem of Art's unity.  But I see it is time for supper.  After we have discussed some Chambertin and a few ortolans, we will pass on to the question of the critic considered in the light of the interpreter.  ERNEST.  Ah! you admit, then, that the critic may occasionally be allowed to see the object as in itself it really is.  GILBERT.  I am not quite sure.  Perhaps I may admit it after supper. There is a subtle influence in supper.     THE CRITIC AS ARTIST WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF DISCUSSING EVERYTHING  ERNEST.  The ortolans were delightful, and the Chambertin perfect, and now let us return to the point at issue.  GILBERT.  Ah! don?t let us do that.  Conversation should touch everything, but should concentrate itself on nothing.  Let us talk about _Moral Indignation_, _its Cause and Cure_, a subject on which I think of writing: or about _The Survival of Thersites_, as shown by the English comic papers; or about any topic that may turn up.  ERNEST.  No; I want to discuss the critic and criticism.  You have told me that the highest criticism deals with art, not as expressive, but as impressive purely, and is consequently both creative and independent, is in fact an art by itself, occupying the same relation to creative work that creative work does to the visible world of form and colour, or the unseen world of passion and of thought.  Well, now, tell me, will not the critic be sometimes a real interpreter?  GILBERT.  Yes; the critic will be an interpreter, if he chooses.  He can pass from his synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole, to an analysis or exposition of the work itself, and in this lower sphere, as I hold it to be, there are many delightful things to be said and done.  Yet his object will not always be to explain the work of art.  He may seek rather to deepen its mystery, to raise round it, and round its maker, that mist of wonder which is dear to both gods and worshippers alike. Ordinary people are ?terribly at ease in Zion.?  They propose to walk arm in arm with the poets, and have a glib ignorant way of saying, ?Why should we read what is written about Shakespeare and Milton?  We can read the plays and the poems.  That is enough.?  But an appreciation of Milton is, as the late Rector of Lincoln remarked once, the reward of consummate scholarship.  And he who desires to understand Shakespeare truly must understand the relations in which Shakespeare stood to the Renaissance and the Reformation, to the age of Elizabeth and the age of James; he must be familiar with the history of the struggle for supremacy between the old classical forms and the new spirit of romance, between the school of Sidney, and Daniel, and Johnson, and the school of Marlowe and Marlowe's greater son; he must know the materials that were at Shakespeare's disposal, and the method in which he used them, and the conditions of theatric presentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, their limitations and their opportunities for freedom, and the literary criticism of Shakespeare's day, its aims and modes and canons; he must study the English language in its progress, and blank or rhymed verse in its various developments; he must study the Greek drama, and the connection between the art of the creator of the Agamemnon and the art of the creator of Macbeth; in a word, he must be able to bind Elizabethan London to the Athens of Pericles, and to learn Shakespeare's true position in the history of European drama and the drama of the world. The critic will certainly be an interpreter, but he will not treat Art as a riddling Sphinx, whose shallow secret may be guessed and revealed by one whose feet are wounded and who knows not his name.  Rather, he will look upon Art as a goddess whose mystery it is his province to intensify, and whose majesty his privilege to make more marvellous in the eyes of men.  And here, Ernest, this strange thing happens.  The critic will indeed be an interpreter, but he will not be an interpreter in the sense of one who simply repeats in another form a message that has been put into his lips to say.  For, just as it is only by contact with the art of foreign nations that the art of a country gains that individual and separate life that we call nationality, so, by curious inversion, it is only by intensifying his own personality that the critic can interpret the personality and work of others, and the more strongly this personality enters into the interpretation the more real the interpretation becomes, the more satisfying, the more convincing, and the more true.  ERNEST.  I would have said that personality would have been a disturbing element.  GILBERT.  No; it is an element of revelation.  If you wish to understand others you must intensify your own individualism.  ERNEST.  What, then, is the result?  GILBERT.  I will tell you, and perhaps I can tell you best by definite example.  It seems to me that, while the literary critic stands of course first, as having the wider range, and larger vision, and nobler material, each of the arts has a critic, as it were, assigned to it.  The actor is a critic of the drama.  He shows the poet's work under new conditions, and by a method special to himself.  He takes the written word, and action, gesture and voice become the media of revelation.  The singer or the player on lute and viol is the critic of music.  The etcher of a picture robs the painting of its fair colours, but shows us by the use of a new material its true colour-quality, its tones and values, and the relations of its masses, and so is, in his way, a critic of it, for the critic is he who exhibits to us a work of art in a form different from that of the work itself, and the employment of a new material is a critical as well as a creative element.  Sculpture, too, has its critic, who may be either the carver of a gem, as he was in Greek days, or some painter like Mantegna, who sought to reproduce on canvas the beauty of plastic line and the symphonic dignity of processional bas-relief.  And in the case of all these creative critics of art it is evident that personality is an absolute essential for any real interpretation.  When Rubinstein plays to us the _Sonata Appassionata_ of Beethoven, he gives us not merely Beethoven, but also himself, and so gives us Beethoven absolutely?Beethoven re-interpreted through a rich artistic nature, and made vivid and wonderful to us by a new and intense personality.  When a great actor plays Shakespeare we have the same experience.  His own individuality becomes a vital part of the interpretation.  People sometimes say that actors give us their own Hamlets, and not Shakespeare's; and this fallacy?for it is a fallacy?is, I regret to say, repeated by that charming and graceful writer who has lately deserted the turmoil of literature for the peace of the House of Commons, I mean the author of _Obiter Dicta_.  In point of fact, there is no such thing as Shakespeare's Hamlet.  If Hamlet has something of the definiteness of a work of art, he has also all the obscurity that belongs to life.  There are as many Hamlets as there are melancholies.  ERNEST.  As many Hamlets as there are melancholies?  GILBERT.  Yes: and as art springs from personality, so it is only to personality that it can be revealed, and from the meeting of the two comes right interpretative criticism.  ERNEST.  The critic, then, considered as the interpreter, will give no less than he receives, and lend as much as he borrows?  GILBERT.  He will be always showing us the work of art in some new relation to our age.  He will always be reminding us that great works of art are living things?are, in fact, the only things that live.  So much, indeed, will he feel this, that I am certain that, as civilisation progresses and we become more highly organised, the elect spirits of each age, the critical and cultured spirits, will grow less and less interested in actual life, and _will seek to gain their impressions almost entirely from what Art has touched_.  For life is terribly deficient in form.  Its catastrophes happen in the wrong way and to the wrong people.  There is a grotesque horror about its comedies, and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce.  One is always wounded when one approaches it.  Things last either too long, or not long enough.  ERNEST.  Poor life!  Poor human life!  Are you not even touched by the tears that the Roman poet tells us are part of its essence.  GILBERT.  Too quickly touched by them, I fear.  For when one looks back upon the life that was so vivid in its emotional intensity, and filled with such fervent moments of ecstasy or of joy, it all seems to be a dream and an illusion.  What are the unreal things, but the passions that once burned one like fire?  What are the incredible things, but the things that one has faithfully believed?  What are the improbable things? The things that one has done oneself.  No, Ernest; life cheats us with shadows, like a puppet-master.  We ask it for pleasure.  It gives it to us, with bitterness and disappointment in its train.  We come across some noble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedy to our days, but it passes away from us, and things less noble take its place, and on some grey windy dawn, or odorous eve of silence and of silver, we find ourselves looking with callous wonder, or dull heart of stone, at the tress of gold-flecked hair that we had once so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed.  ERNEST.  Life then is a failure?  GILBERT.  From the artistic point of view, certainly.  And the chief thing that makes life a failure from this artistic point of view is the thing that lends to life its sordid security, the fact that one can never repeat exactly the same emotion.  How different it is in the world of Art!  On a shelf of the bookcase behind you stands the _Divine Comedy_, and I know that, if I open it at a certain place, I shall be filled with a fierce hatred of some one who has never wronged me, or stirred by a great love for some one whom I shall never see.  There is no mood or passion that Art cannot give us, and those of us who have discovered her secret can settle beforehand what our experiences are going to be.  We can choose our day and select our hour.  We can say to ourselves, ?To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through the valley of the shadow of death,? and lo! the dawn finds us in the obscure wood, and the Mantuan stands by our side.  We pass through the gate of the legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the horror of another world.  The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces and their cowls of gilded lead.  Out of the ceaseless winds that drive them, the carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh, and the glutton lashed by the rain.  We break the withered branches from the tree in the grove of the Harpies, and each dull-hued poisonous twig bleeds with red blood before us, and cries aloud with bitter cries.  Out of a horn of fire Odysseus speaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of flame the great Ghibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the torture of that bed becomes ours for a moment.  Through the dim purple air fly those who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin, and in the pit of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen of body into the semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia, the coiner of false coin.  He bids us listen to his misery; we stop, and with dry and gaping lips he tells us how he dreams day and night of the brooks of clear water that in cool dewy channels gush down the green Casentine hills.  Sinon, the false Greek of Troy, mocks at him.  He smites him in the face, and they wrangle.  We are fascinated by their shame, and loiter, till Virgil chides us and leads us away to that city turreted by giants where great Nimrod blows his horn.  Terrible things are in store for us, and we go to meet them in Dante's raiment and with Dante's heart.  We traverse the marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boat through the slimy waves.  He calls to us, and we reject him.  When we hear the voice of his agony we are glad, and Virgil praises us for the bitterness of our scorn. We tread upon the cold crystal of Cocytus, in which traitors stick like straws in glass.  Our foot strikes against the head of Bocca.  He will not tell us his name, and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming skull.  Alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his fac|2
65|e that he may weep a little.  We pledge our word to him, and when he has uttered his dolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken, and pass from him; such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who more base than he who has mercy for the condemned of God?  In the jaws of Lucifer we see the man who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the men who slew C'sar.  We tremble, and come forth to re-behold the stars.  In the land of Purgation the air is freer, and the holy mountain rises into the pure light of day.  There is peace for us, and for those who for a season abide in it there is some peace also, though, pale from the poison of the Maremma, Madonna Pia passes before us, and Ismene, with the sorrow of earth still lingering about her, is there.  Soul after soul makes us share in some repentance or some joy.  He whom the mourning of his widow taught to drink the sweet wormwood of pain, tells us of Nella praying in her lonely bed, and we learn from the mouth of Buonconte how a single tear may save a dying sinner from the fiend.  Sordello, that noble and disdainful Lombard, eyes us from afar like a couchant lion.  When he learns that Virgil is one of Mantua's citizens, he falls upon his neck, and when he learns that he is the singer of Rome he falls before his feet.  In that valley whose grass and flowers are fairer than cleft emerald and Indian wood, and brighter than scarlet and silver, they are singing who in the world were kings; but the lips of Rudolph of Hapsburg do not move to the music of the others, and Philip of France beats his breast and Henry of England sits alone.  On and on we go, climbing the marvellous stair, and the stars become larger than their wont, and the song of the kings grows faint, and at length we reach the seven trees of gold and the garden of the Earthly Paradise.  In a griffin-drawn chariot appears one whose brows are bound with olive, who is veiled in white, and mantled in green, and robed in a vesture that is coloured like live fire. The ancient flame wakes within us.  Our blood quickens through terrible pulses.  We recognise her.  It is Beatrice, the woman we have worshipped. The ice congealed about our heart melts.  Wild tears of anguish break from us, and we bow our forehead to the ground, for we know that we have sinned.  When we have done penance, and are purified, and have drunk of the fountain of Lethe and bathed in the fountain of Eunoe, the mistress of our soul raises us to the Paradise of Heaven.  Out of that eternal pearl, the moon, the face of Piccarda Donati leans to us.  Her beauty troubles us for a moment, and when, like a thing that falls through water, she passes away, we gaze after her with wistful eyes.  The sweet planet of Venus is full of lovers.  Cunizza, the sister of Ezzelin, the lady of Sordello's heart, is there, and Folco, the passionate singer of Provence, who in sorrow for Azalais forsook the world, and the Canaanitish harlot whose soul was the first that Christ redeemed. Joachim of Flora stands in the sun, and, in the sun, Aquinas recounts the story of St. Francis and Bonaventure the story of St. Dominic.  Through the burning rubies of Mars, Cacciaguida approaches.  He tells us of the arrow that is shot from the bow of exile, and how salt tastes the bread of another, and how steep are the stairs in the house of a stranger.  In Saturn the soul sings not, and even she who guides us dare not smile.  On a ladder of gold the flames rise and fall.  At last, we see the pageant of the Mystical Rose.  Beatrice fixes her eyes upon the face of God to turn them not again.  The beatific vision is granted to us; we know the Love that moves the sun and all the stars.  Yes, we can put the earth back six hundred courses and make ourselves one with the great Florentine, kneel at the same altar with him, and share his rapture and his scorn.  And if we grow tired of an antique time, and desire to realise our own age in all its weariness and sin, are there not books that can make us live more in one single hour than life can make us live in a score of shameful years?  Close to your hand lies a little volume, bound in some Nile-green skin that has been powdered with gilded nenuphars and smoothed with hard ivory.  It is the book that Gautier loved, it is Baudelaire's masterpiece.  Open it at that sad madrigal that begins      Que m?importe que tu sois sage?     Sois belle! et sois triste!  and you will find yourself worshipping sorrow as you have never worshipped joy.  Pass on to the poem on the man who tortures himself, let its subtle music steal into your brain and colour your thoughts, and you will become for a moment what he was who wrote it; nay, not for a moment only, but for many barren moonlit nights and sunless sterile days will a despair that is not your own make its dwelling within you, and the misery of another gnaw your heart away.  Read the whole book, suffer it to tell even one of its secrets to your soul, and your soul will grow eager to know more, and will feed upon poisonous honey, and seek to repent of strange crimes of which it is guiltless, and to make atonement for terrible pleasures that it has never known.  And then, when you are tired of these flowers of evil, turn to the flowers that grow in the garden of Perdita, and in their dew-drenched chalices cool your fevered brow, and let their loveliness heal and restore your soul; or wake from his forgotten tomb the sweet Syrian, Meleager, and bid the lover of Heliodore make you music, for he too has flowers in his song, red pomegranate blossoms, and irises that smell of myrrh, ringed daffodils and dark blue hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkled ox-eyes.  Dear to him was the perfume of the bean-field at evening, and dear to him the odorous eared-spikenard that grew on the Syrian hills, and the fresh green thyme, the wine-cup's charm.  The feet of his love as she walked in the garden were like lilies set upon lilies.  Softer than sleep-laden poppy petals were her lips, softer than violets and as scented.  The flame-like crocus sprang from the grass to look at her.  For her the slim narcissus stored the cool rain; and for her the anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that wooed them.  And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor narcissus was as fair as she was.  It is a strange thing, this transference of emotion.  We sicken with the same maladies as the poets, and the singer lends us his pain.  Dead lips have their message for us, and hearts that have fallen to dust can communicate their joy.  We run to kiss the bleeding mouth of Fantine, and we follow Manon Lescaut over the whole world.  Ours is the love-madness of the Tyrian, and the terror of Orestes is ours also.  There is no passion that we cannot feel, no pleasure that we may not gratify, and we can choose the time of our initiation and the time of our freedom also. Life!  Life!  Don?t let us go to life for our fulfilment or our experience.  It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent in its utterance, and without that fine correspondence of form and spirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic and critical temperament. It makes us pay too high a price for its wares, and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that is monstrous and infinite.  ERNEST.  Must we go, then, to Art for everything?  GILBERT.  For everything.  Because Art does not hurt us.  The tears that we shed at a play are a type of the exquisite sterile emotions that it is the function of Art to awaken.  We weep, but we are not wounded.  We grieve, but our grief is not bitter.  In the actual life of man, sorrow, as Spinoza says somewhere, is a passage to a lesser perfection.  But the sorrow with which Art fills us both purifies and initiates, if I may quote once more from the great art critic of the Greeks.  It is through Art, and through Art only, that we can realise our perfection; through Art, and through Art only, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actual existence.  This results not merely from the fact that nothing that one can imagine is worth doing, and that one can imagine everything, but from the subtle law that emotional forces, like the forces of the physical sphere, are limited in extent and energy.  One can feel so much, and no more.  And how can it matter with what pleasure life tries to tempt one, or with what pain it seeks to maim and mar one's soul, if in the spectacle of the lives of those who have never existed one has found the true secret of joy, and wept away one's tears over their deaths who, like Cordelia and the daughter of Brabantio, can never die?  ERNEST.  Stop a moment.  It seems to me that in everything that you have said there is something radically immoral.  GILBERT.  All art is immoral.  ERNEST.  All art?  GILBERT.  Yes.  For emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for the sake of action is the aim of life, and of that practical organisation of life that we call society.  Society, which is the beginning and basis of morals, exists simply for the concentration of human energy, and in order to ensure its own continuance and healthy stability it demands, and no doubt rightly demands, of each of its citizens that he should contribute some form of productive labour to the common weal, and toil and travail that the day's work may be done. Society often forgives the criminal; it never forgives the dreamer.  The beautiful sterile emotions that art excites in us are hateful in its eyes, and so completely are people dominated by the tyranny of this dreadful social ideal that they are always coming shamelessly up to one at Private Views and other places that are open to the general public, and saying in a loud stentorian voice, ?What are you doing?? whereas ?What are you thinking?? is the only question that any single civilised being should ever be allowed to whisper to another.  They mean well, no doubt, these honest beaming folk.  Perhaps that is the reason why they are so excessively tedious.  But some one should teach them that while, in the opinion of society, Contemplation is the gravest sin of which any citizen can be guilty, in the opinion of the highest culture it is the proper occupation of man.  ERNEST.  Contemplation?  GILBERT.  Contemplation.  I said to you some time ago that it was far more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it.  Let me say to you now that to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world, the most difficult and the most intellectual.  To Plato, with his passion for wisdom, this was the noblest form of energy.  To Aristotle, with his passion for knowledge, this was the noblest form of energy also.  It was to this that the passion for holiness led the saint and the mystic of medi?val days.  ERNEST.  We exist, then, to do nothing?  GILBERT.  It is to do nothing that the elect exist.  Action is limited and relative.  Unlimited and absolute is the vision of him who sits at ease and watches, who walks in loneliness and dreams.  But we who are born at the close of this wonderful age are at once too cultured and too critical, too intellectually subtle and too curious of exquisite pleasures, to accept any speculations about life in exchange for life itself.  To us the _citt? divina_ is colourless, and the _fruitio Dei_ without meaning.  Metaphysics do not satisfy our temperaments, and religious ecstasy is out of date.  The world through which the Academic philosopher becomes ?the spectator of all time and of all existence? is not really an ideal world, but simply a world of abstract ideas.  When we enter it, we starve amidst the chill mathematics of thought.  The courts of the city of God are not open to us now.  Its gates are guarded by Ignorance, and to pass them we have to surrender all that in our nature is most divine.  It is enough that our fathers believed.  They have exhausted the faith-faculty of the species.  Their legacy to us is the scepticism of which they were afraid.  Had they put it into words, it might not live within us as thought.  No, Ernest, no.  We cannot go back to the saint.  There is far more to be learned from the sinner.  We cannot go back to the philosopher, and the mystic leads us astray.  Who, as Mr. Pater suggests somewhere, would exchange the curve of a single rose-leaf for that formless intangible Being which Plato rates so high? What to us is the Illumination of Philo, the Abyss of Eckhart, the Vision of B?hme, the monstrous Heaven itself that was revealed to Swedenborg's blinded eyes?  Such things are less than the yellow trumpet of one daffodil of the field, far less than the meanest of the visible arts, for, just as Nature is matter struggling into mind, so Art is mind expressing itself under the conditions of matter, and thus, even in the lowliest of her manifestations, she speaks to both sense and soul alike. To the 'sthetic temperament the vague is always repellent.  The Greeks were a nation of artists, because they were spared the sense of the infinite.  Like Aristotle, like Goethe after he had read Kant, we desire the concrete, and nothing but the concrete can satisfy us.  ERNEST.  What then do you propose?  GILBERT.  It seems to me that with the development of the critical spirit we shall be able to realise, not merely our own lives, but the collective life of the race, and so to make ourselves absolutely modern, in the true meaning of the word modernity.  For he to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knows nothing of the age in which he lives.  To realise the nineteenth century, one must realise every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making.  To know anything about oneself one must know all about others.  There must be no mood with which one cannot sympathise, no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive.  Is this impossible?  I think not.  By revealing to us the absolute mechanism of all action, and so freeing us from the self-imposed and trammelling burden of moral responsibility, the scientific principle of Heredity has become, as it were, the warrant for the contemplative life.  It has shown us that we are never less free than when we try to act.  It has hemmed us round with the nets of the hunter, and written upon the wall the prophecy of our doom.  We may not watch it, for it is within us.  We may not see it, save in a mirror that mirrors the soul. It is Nemesis without her mask.  It is the last of the Fates, and the most terrible.  It is the only one of the Gods whose real name we know.  And yet, while in the sphere of practical and external life it has robbed energy of its freedom and activity of its choice, in the subjective sphere, where the soul is at work, it comes to us, this terrible shadow, with many gifts in its hands, gifts of strange temperaments and subtle susceptibilities, gifts of wild ardours and chill moods of indifference, complex multiform gifts of thoughts that are at variance with each other, and passions that war against themselves.  And so, it is not our own life that we live, but the lives of the dead, and the soul that dwells within us is no single spiritual entity, making us personal and individual, created for our service, and entering into us for our joy.  It is something that has dwelt in fearful places, and in ancient sepulchres has made its abode.  It is sick with many maladies, and has memories of curious sins.  It is wiser than we are, and its wisdom is bitter.  It fills us with impossible desires, and makes us follow what we know we cannot gain.  One thing, however, Ernest, it can do for us.  It can lead us away from surroundings whose beauty is dimmed to us by the mist of familiarity, or whose ignoble ugliness and sordid claims are marring the perfection of our development.  It can help us to leave the age in which we were born, and to pass into other ages, and find ourselves not exiled from their air.  It can teach us how to escape from our experience, and to realise the experiences of those who are greater than we are.  The pain of Leopardi crying out against life becomes our pain.  Theocritus blows on his pipe, and we laugh with the lips of nymph and shepherd.  In the wolfskin of Pierre Vidal we flee before the hounds, and in the armour of Lancelot we ride from the bower of the Queen.  We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowl of Abelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have put our shame into song.  We can see the dawn through Shelley's eyes, and when we wander with Endymion the Moon grows amorous of our youth.  Ours is the anguish of Atys, and ours the weak rage and noble sorrows of the Dane.  Do you think that it is the imagination that enables us to live these countless lives?  Yes: it is the imagination; and the imagination is the result of heredity.  It is simply concentrated race-experience.  ERNEST.  But where in this is the function of the critical spirit?  GILBERT.  The culture that this transmission of racial experiences makes possible can be made perfect by the critical spirit alone, and indeed may be said to be one with it.  For who is the true critic but he who bears within himself the dreams, and ideas, and feelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought is alien, no emotional impulse obscure? And who the true man of culture, if not he who by fine scholarship and fastidious rejection has made instinct self-conscious and intelligent, and can separate the work that has distinction from the work that has it not, and so by contact and comparison makes himself master of the secrets of style and school, and understands their meanings, and listens to their voices, and develops that spirit of disinterested curiosity which is the real root, as it is the real flower, of the intellectual life, and thus attains to intellectual clarity, and, having learned ?the best that is known and thought in the world,? lives?it is not fanciful to say so?with those who are the Immortals.  Yes, Ernest: the contemplative life, the life that has for its aim not _doing_ but _being_, and not _being_ merely, but _becoming_?that is what the critical spirit can give us.  The gods live thus: either brooding over their own perfection, as Aristotle tells us, or, as Epicurus fancied, watching with the calm eyes of the spectator the tragicomedy of the world that they have made.  We, too, might live like them, and set ourselves to witness with appropriate emotions the varied scenes that man and nature afford.  We might make ourselves spiritual by detaching ourselves from action, and become perfect by the rejection of energy.  It has often seemed to me that Browning felt something of this.  Shakespeare hurls Hamlet into active life, and makes him realise his mission by effort.  Browning might have given us a Hamlet who would have realised his mission by thought.  Incident and event were to him unreal or unmeaning.  He made the soul the protagonist of life's tragedy, and looked on action as the one undramatic element of a play.  To us, at any rate, the ???? ?????????? is the true ideal.  From the high tower of Thought we can look out at the world.  Calm, and self-centred, and complete, the 'sthetic critic contemplates life, and no arrow drawn at a venture can pierce between the joints of his harness.  He at least is safe.  He has discovered how to live.  Is such a mode of life immoral?  Yes: all the arts are immoral, except those baser forms of sensual or didactic art that seek to excite to action of evil or of good.  For action of every kind belongs to the sphere of ethics.  The aim of art is simply to create a mood.  Is such a mode of life unpractical?  Ah! it is not so easy to be unpractical as the ignorant Philistine imagines.  It were well for England if it were so. There is no country in the world so much in need of unpractical people as this country of ours.  With us, Thought is degraded by its constant association with practice.  Who that moves in the stress and turmoil of actual existence, noisy politician, or brawling social reformer, or poor narrow-minded priest blinded by the sufferings of that unimportant section of the community among whom he has cast his lot, can seriously claim to be able to form a disinterested intellectual judgment about any one thing?  Each of the professions means a prejudice.  The necessity for a career forces every one to take sides.  We live in the age of the overworked, and the under-educated; the age in which people are so industrious that they become absolutely stupid.  And, harsh though it may sound, I cannot help saying that such people deserve their doom.  The sure way of knowing nothing about life is to try to make oneself useful.  ERNEST.  A charming doctrine, Gilbert.  GILBERT.  I am not sure about that, but it has at least the minor merit of being true.  That the desire to do good to others produces a plentiful crop of prigs is the least of the evils of which it is the cause.  The prig is a very interesting psychological study, and though of all poses a moral pose is the most offensive, still to have a pose at all is something.  It is a formal recognition of the importance of treating life from a definite and reasoned standpoint.  That Humanitarian Sympathy wars against Nature, by securing the survival of the failure, may make the man of science loathe its facile virtues.  The political economist may cry out against it for putting the improvident on the same level as the provident, and so robbing life of the strongest, because most sordid, incentive to industry.  But, in the eyes of the thinker, the real harm that emotional sympathy does is that it limits knowledge, and so prevents us from solving any single social problem.  We are trying at present to stave off the coming crisis, the coming revolution as my friends the Fabianists call it, by means of doles and alms.  Well, when the revolution or crisis arrives, we shall be powerless, because we shall know nothing.  And so, Ernest, let us not be deceived.  England will never be civilised till she has added Utopia to her dominions.  There is more than one of her colonies that she might with advantage surrender for so fair a land.  What we want are unpractical people who see beyond the moment, and think beyond the day.  Those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob.  It is through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the ways of the gods must be prepared.  But perhaps you think that in beholding for the mere joy of beholding, and contemplating for the sake of contemplation, there is something that is egotistic.  If you think so, do not say so.  It takes a thoroughly selfish age, like our own, to deify self-sacrifice.  It takes a thoroughly grasping age, such as that in which we live, to set above the fine intellectual virtues, those shallow and emotional virtues that are an immediate practical benefit to itself.  They miss their aim, too, these philanthropists and sentimentalists of our day, who are always chattering to one about one's duty to one's neighbour.  For the development of the race depends on the development of the individual, and where self-culture has ceased to be the ideal, the intellectual standard is instantly lowered, and, often, ultimately lost.  If you meet at dinner a man who has spent his life in educating himself?a rare type in our time, I admit, but still one occasionally to be met with?you rise from table richer, and conscious that a high ideal has for a moment touched and sanctified your days.  But oh! my dear Ernest, to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying to educate others!  What a dreadful experience that is!  How appalling is that ignorance which is the inevitable result of the fatal habit of imparting opinions!  How limited in range the creature's mind proves to be!  How it wearies us, and must weary himself, with its endless repetitions and sickly reiteration!  How lacking it is in any element of intellectual growth!  In what a vicious circle it always moves!  ERNEST.  You speak with strange feeling, Gilbert.  Have you had this dreadful experience, as you call it, lately?  GILBERT.  Few of us escape it. People say that the schoolmaster is abroad.  I wish to goodness he were.  But the type of which, after all, he is only one, and certainly the least important, of the representatives, seems to me to be really dominating our lives; and just as the philanthropist is the nuisance of the ethical sphere, so the nuisance of the intellectual sphere is the man who is so occupied in trying to educate others, that he has never had any time to educate himself.  No, Ernest, self-culture is the true ideal of man.  Goethe saw it, and the immediate debt that we owe to Goethe is greater than the debt we owe to any man since Greek days.  The Greeks saw it, and have left us, as their legacy to modern thought, the conception of the contemplative life as well as the critical method by which alone can that life be truly realised.  It was the one thing that made the Renaissance great, and gave us Humanism.  It is the one thing that could make our own age great also; for the real weakness of England lies, not in incomplete armaments or unfortified coasts, not in the poverty that creeps through sunless lanes, or the drunkenness that brawls in loathsome courts, but simply in the fact that her ideals are emotional and not intellectual.  I do not deny that the intellectual ideal is difficult of attainment, still less that it is, and perhaps will be for years to come, unpopular with the crowd.  It is so easy for people to have sympathy with suffering.  It is so difficult for them to have sympathy with thought. Indeed, so little do ordinary people understand what thought really is, that they seem to imagine that, when they have said that a theory is dangerous, they have pronounced its condemnation, whereas it is only such theories that have any true intellectual value.  An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.  ERNEST.  Gilbert, you bewilder me.  You have told me that all art is, in its essence, immoral.  Are you going to tell me now that all thought is, in its essence, dangerous?  GILBERT.  Yes, in the practical sphere it is so.  The security of society lies in custom and unconscious instinct, and the basis of the stability of society, as a healthy organism, is the complete absence of any intelligence amongst its members.  The great majority of people being fully aware of this, rank themselves naturally on the side of that splendid system that elevates them to the dignity of machines, and rage so wildly against the intrusion of the intellectual faculty into any question that concerns life, that one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.  But let us turn from the practical sphere, and say no more about the wicked philanthropists, who, indeed, may well be left to the mercy of the almond-eyed sage of the Yellow River Chuang Tsu the wise, who has proved that such well-meaning and offensive busybodies have destroyed the simple and spontaneous virtue that there is in man.  They are a wearisome topic, and I am anxious to get back to the sphere in which criticism is free.  ERNEST.  The sphere of the intellect?  GILBERT.  Yes.  You remember that I spoke of the critic as being in his own way as creative as the artist, whose work, indeed, may be merely of value in so far as it gives to the critic a suggestion for some new mood of thought and feeling which he can realise with equal, or perhaps greater, distinction of form, and, through the use of a fresh medium of expression, make differently beautiful and more perfect.  Well, you seemed to be a little sceptical about the theory.  But perhaps I wronged you?  ERNEST.  I am not really sceptical about it, but I must admit that I feel very strongly that such work as you describe the critic producing?and creative such work must undoubtedly be admitted to be?is, of necessity, purely subjective, whereas the greatest work is objective always, objective and impersonal.  GILBERT.  The difference between objective and subjective work is one of external form merely.  It is accidental, not essential.  All artistic creation is absolutely subjective.  The very landscape that Corot looked at was, as he said himself, but a mood of his own mind; and those great figures of Greek or English drama that seem to us to possess an actual existence of their own, apart from the poets who shaped and fashioned them, ar|2
66|e, in their ultimate analysis, simply the poets themselves, not as they thought they were, but as they thought they were not; and by such thinking came in strange manner, though but for a moment, really so to be.  For out of ourselves we can never pass, nor can there be in creation what in the creator was not.  Nay, I would say that the more objective a creation appears to be, the more subjective it really is.  Shakespeare might have met Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in the white streets of London, or seen the serving-men of rival houses bite their thumbs at each other in the open square; but Hamlet came out of his soul, and Romeo out of his passion.  They were elements of his nature to which he gave visible form, impulses that stirred so strongly within him that he had, as it were perforce, to suffer them to realise their energy, not on the lower plane of actual life, where they would have been trammelled and constrained and so made imperfect, but on that imaginative plane of art where Love can indeed find in Death its rich fulfilment, where one can stab the eavesdropper behind the arras, and wrestle in a new-made grave, and make a guilty king drink his own hurt, and see one's father's spirit, beneath the glimpses of the moon, stalking in complete steel from misty wall to wall.  Action being limited would have left Shakespeare unsatisfied and unexpressed; and, just as it is because he did nothing that he has been able to achieve everything, so it is because he never speaks to us of himself in his plays that his plays reveal him to us absolutely, and show us his true nature and temperament far more completely than do those strange and exquisite sonnets, even, in which he bares to crystal eyes the secret closet of his heart.  Yes, the objective form is the most subjective in matter.  Man is least himself when he talks in his own person.  Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.  ERNEST.  The critic, then, being limited to the subjective form, will necessarily be less able fully to express himself than the artist, who has always at his disposal the forms that are impersonal and objective.  GILBERT.  Not necessarily, and certainly not at all if he recognises that each mode of criticism is, in its highest development, simply a mood, and that we are never more true to ourselves than when we are inconsistent. The 'sthetic critic, constant only to the principle of beauty in all things, will ever be looking for fresh impressions, winning from the various schools the secret of their charm, bowing, it may be, before foreign altars, or smiling, if it be his fancy, at strange new gods. What other people call one's past has, no doubt, everything to do with them, but has absolutely nothing to do with oneself.  The man who regards his past is a man who deserves to have no future to look forward to. When one has found expression for a mood, one has done with it.  You laugh; but believe me it is so.  Yesterday it was Realism that charmed one.  One gained from it that _nouveau frisson_ which it was its aim to produce.  One analysed it, explained it, and wearied of it.  At sunset came the _Luministe_ in painting, and the _Symboliste_ in poetry, and the spirit of medi?valism, that spirit which belongs not to time but to temperament, woke suddenly in wounded Russia, and stirred us for a moment by the terrible fascination of pain.  To-day the cry is for Romance, and already the leaves are tremulous in the valley, and on the purple hill-tops walks Beauty with slim gilded feet.  The old modes of creation linger, of course.  The artists reproduce either themselves or each other, with wearisome iteration.  But Criticism is always moving on, and the critic is always developing.  Nor, again, is the critic really limited to the subjective form of expression.  The method of the drama is his, as well as the method of the epos.  He may use dialogue, as he did who set Milton talking to Marvel on the nature of comedy and tragedy, and made Sidney and Lord Brooke discourse on letters beneath the Penshurst oaks; or adopt narration, as Mr. Pater is fond of doing, each of whose Imaginary Portraits?is not that the title of the book??presents to us, under the fanciful guise of fiction, some fine and exquisite piece of criticism, one on the painter Watteau, another on the philosophy of Spinoza, a third on the Pagan elements of the early Renaissance, and the last, and in some respects the most suggestive, on the source of that Aufkl?rung, that enlightening which dawned on Germany in the last century, and to which our own culture owes so great a debt.  Dialogue, certainly, that wonderful literary form which, from Plato to Lucian, and from Lucian to Giordano Bruno, and from Bruno to that grand old Pagan in whom Carlyle took such delight, the creative critics of the world have always employed, can never lose for the thinker its attraction as a mode of expression.  By its means he can both reveal and conceal himself, and give form to every fancy, and reality to every mood.  By its means he can exhibit the object from each point of view, and show it to us in the round, as a sculptor shows us things, gaining in this manner all the richness and reality of effect that comes from those side issues that are suddenly suggested by the central idea in its progress, and really illumine the idea more completely, or from those felicitous after-thoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme, and yet convey something of the delicate charm of chance.  ERNEST.  By its means, too, he can invent an imaginary antagonist, and convert him when he chooses by some absurdly sophistical argument.  GILBERT.  Ah! it is so easy to convert others.  It is so difficult to convert oneself.  To arrive at what one really believes, one must speak through lips different from one's own.  To know the truth one must imagine myriads of falsehoods.  For what is Truth?  In matters of religion, it is simply the opinion that has survived.  In matters of science, it is the ultimate sensation.  In matters of art, it is one's last mood.  And you see now, Ernest, that the critic has at his disposal as many objective forms of expression as the artist has.  Ruskin put his criticism into imaginative prose, and is superb in his changes and contradictions; and Browning put his into blank verse and made painter and poet yield us their secret; and M. Renan uses dialogue, and Mr. Pater fiction, and Rossetti translated into sonnet-music the colour of Giorgione and the design of Ingres, and his own design and colour also, feeling, with the instinct of one who had many modes of utterance; that the ultimate art is literature, and the finest and fullest medium that of words.  ERNEST.  Well, now that you have settled that the critic has at his disposal all objective forms, I wish you would tell me what are the qualities that should characterise the true critic.  GILBERT.  What would you say they were?  ERNEST.  Well, I should say that a critic should above all things be fair.  GILBERT.  Ah! not fair.  A critic cannot be fair in the ordinary sense of the word.  It is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiassed opinion, which is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always absolutely valueless.  The man who sees both sides of a question, is a man who sees absolutely nothing at all.  Art is a passion, and, in matters of art, Thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluid rather than fixed, and, depending upon fine moods and exquisite moments, cannot be narrowed into the rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma.  It is to the soul that Art speaks, and the soul may be made the prisoner of the mind as well as of the body.  One should, of course, have no prejudices; but, as a great Frenchman remarked a hundred years ago, it is one's business in such matters to have preferences, and when one has preferences one ceases to be fair.  It is only an auctioneer who can equally and impartially admire all schools of Art.  No; fairness is not one of the qualities of the true critic.  It is not even a condition of criticism.  Each form of Art with which we come in contact dominates us for the moment to the exclusion of every other form.  We must surrender ourselves absolutely to the work in question, whatever it may be, if we wish to gain its secret.  For the time, we must think of nothing else, can think of nothing else, indeed.  ERNEST.  The true critic will be rational, at any rate, will he not?  GILBERT.  Rational?  There are two ways of disliking art, Ernest.  One is to dislike it.  The other, to like it rationally.  For Art, as Plato saw, and not without regret, creates in listener and spectator a form of divine madness.  It does not spring from inspiration, but it makes others inspired.  Reason is not the faculty to which it appeals.  If one loves Art at all, one must love it beyond all other things in the world, and against such love, the reason, if one listened to it, would cry out. There is nothing sane about the worship of beauty.  It is too splendid to be sane.  Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will always seem to the world to be pure visionaries.  ERNEST.  Well, at least, the critic will be sincere.  GILBERT.  A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.  The true critic will, indeed, always be sincere in his devotion to the principle of beauty, but he will seek for beauty in every age and in each school, and will never suffer himself to be limited to any settled custom of thought or stereotyped mode of looking at things.  He will realise himself in many forms, and by a thousand different ways, and will ever be curious of new sensations and fresh points of view.  Through constant change, and through constant change alone, he will find his true unity.  He will not consent to be the slave of his own opinions.  For what is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?  The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth.  You must not be frightened by word, Ernest.  What people call insincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply our personalities.  ERNEST.  I am afraid I have not been fortunate in my suggestions.  GILBERT.  Of the three qualifications you mentioned, two, sincerity and fairness, were, if not actually moral, at least on the borderland of morals, and the first condition of criticism is that the critic should be able to recognise that the sphere of Art and the sphere of Ethics are absolutely distinct and separate.  When they are confused, Chaos has come again.  They are too often confused in England now, and though our modern Puritans cannot destroy a beautiful thing, yet, by means of their extraordinary prurience, they can almost taint beauty for a moment.  It is chiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people find expression.  I regret it because there is much to be said in favour of modern journalism.  By giving us the opinions of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.  By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows us of what very little importance such events really are.  By invariably discussing the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture, and what are not.  But it should not allow poor Tartuffe to write articles upon modern art.  When it does this it stultifies itself. And yet Tartuffe's articles and Chadband's notes do this good, at least. They serve to show how extremely limited is the area over which ethics, and ethical considerations, can claim to exercise influence.  Science is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths. Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon things beautiful and immortal and ever-changing.  To morals belong the lower and less intellectual spheres.  However, let these mouthing Puritans pass; they have their comic side.  Who can help laughing when an ordinary journalist seriously proposes to limit the subject-matter at the disposal of the artist?  Some limitation might well, and will soon, I hope, be placed upon some of our newspapers and newspaper writers.  For they give us the bald, sordid, disgusting facts of life.  They chronicle, with degrading avidity, the sins of the second-rate, and with the conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details of the doings of people of absolutely no interest whatsoever.  But the artist, who accepts the facts of life, and yet transforms them into shapes of beauty, and makes them vehicles of pity or of awe, and shows their colour-element, and their wonder, and their true ethical import also, and builds out of them a world more real than reality itself, and of loftier and more noble import?who shall set limits to him?  Not the apostles of that new Journalism which is but the old vulgarity ?writ large.?  Not the apostles of that new Puritanism, which is but the whine of the hypocrite, and is both writ and spoken badly.  The mere suggestion is ridiculous.  Let us leave these wicked people, and proceed to the discussion of the artistic qualifications necessary for the true critic.  ERNEST.  And what are they?  Tell me yourself.  GILBERT.  Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic?a temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the various impressions that beauty gives us.  Under what conditions, and by what means, this temperament is engendered in race or individual, we will not discuss at present.  It is sufficient to note that it exists, and that there is in us a beauty-sense, separate from the other senses and above them, separate from the reason and of nobler import, separate from the soul and of equal value?a sense that leads some to create, and others, the finer spirits as I think, to contemplate merely.  But to be purified and made perfect, this sense requires some form of exquisite environment. Without this it starves, or is dulled.  You remember that lovely passage in which Plato describes how a young Greek should be educated, and with what insistence he dwells upon the importance of surroundings, telling us how the lad is to be brought up in the midst of fair sights and sounds, so that the beauty of material things may prepare his soul for the reception of the beauty that is spiritual.  Insensibly, and without knowing the reason why, he is to develop that real love of beauty which, as Plato is never weary of reminding us, is the true aim of education. By slow degrees there is to be engendered in him such a temperament as will lead him naturally and simply to choose the good in preference to the bad, and, rejecting what is vulgar and discordant, to follow by fine instinctive taste all that possesses grace and charm and loveliness. Ultimately, in its due course, this taste is to become critical and self-conscious, but at first it is to exist purely as a cultivated instinct, and ?he who has received this true culture of the inner man will with clear and certain vision perceive the omissions and faults in art or nature, and with a taste that cannot err, while he praises, and finds his pleasure in what is good, and receives it into his soul, and so becomes good and noble, he will rightly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why?: and so, when, later on, the critical and self-conscious spirit develops in him, he ?will recognise and salute it as a friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.?  I need hardly say, Ernest, how far we in England have fallen short of this ideal, and I can imagine the smile that would illuminate the glossy face of the Philistine if one ventured to suggest to him that the true aim of education was the love of beauty, and that the methods by which education should work were the development of temperament, the cultivation of taste, and the creation of the critical spirit.  Yet, even for us, there is left some loveliness of environment, and the dulness of tutors and professors matters very little when one can loiter in the grey cloisters at Magdalen, and listen to some flute-like voice singing in Waynfleete's chapel, or lie in the green meadow, among the strange snake-spotted fritillaries, and watch the sunburnt noon smite to a finer gold the tower's gilded vanes, or wander up the Christ Church staircase beneath the vaulted ceiling's shadowy fans, or pass through the sculptured gateway of Laud's building in the College of St. John.  Nor is it merely at Oxford, or Cambridge, that the sense of beauty can be formed and trained and perfected.  All over England there is a Renaissance of the decorative Arts.  Ugliness has had its day.  Even in the houses of the rich there is taste, and the houses of those who are not rich have been made gracious and comely and sweet to live in.  Caliban, poor noisy Caliban, thinks that when he has ceased to make mows at a thing, the thing ceases to exist.  But if he mocks no longer, it is because he has been met with mockery, swifter and keener than his own, and for a moment has been bitterly schooled into that silence which should seal for ever his uncouth distorted lips.  What has been done up to now, has been chiefly in the clearing of the way.  It is always more difficult to destroy than it is to create, and when what one has to destroy is vulgarity and stupidity, the task of destruction needs not merely courage but also contempt.  Yet it seems to me to have been, in a measure, done. We have got rid of what was bad.  We have now to make what is beautiful. And though the mission of the 'sthetic movement is to lure people to contemplate, not to lead them to create, yet, as the creative instinct is strong in the Celt, and it is the Celt who leads in art, there is no reason why in future years this strange Renaissance should not become almost as mighty in its way as was that new birth of Art that woke many centuries ago in the cities of Italy.  Certainly, for the cultivation of temperament, we must turn to the decorative arts: to the arts that touch us, not to the arts that teach us.  Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at.  At least, some of them are.  But they are quite impossible to live with; they are too clever, too assertive, too intellectual.  Their meaning is too obvious, and their method too clearly defined.  One exhausts what they have to say in a very short time, and then they become as tedious as one's relations.  I am very fond of the work of many of the Impressionist painters of Paris and London.  Subtlety and distinction have not yet left the school.  Some of their arrangements and harmonies serve to remind one of the unapproachable beauty of Gautier's immortal _Symphonie en Blanc Majeur_, that flawless masterpiece of colour and music which may have suggested the type as well as the titles of many of their best pictures. For a class that welcomes the incompetent with sympathetic eagerness, and that confuses the bizarre with the beautiful, and vulgarity with truth, they are extremely accomplished.  They can do etchings that have the brilliancy of epigrams, pastels that are as fascinating as paradoxes, and as for their portraits, whatever the commonplace may say against them, no one can deny that they possess that unique and wonderful charm which belongs to works of pure fiction.  But even the Impressionists, earnest and industrious as they are, will not do.  I like them.  Their white keynote, with its variations in lilac, was an era in colour.  Though the moment does not make the man, the moment certainly makes the Impressionist, and for the moment in art, and the ?moment's monument,? as Rossetti phrased it, what may not be said?  They are suggestive also.  If they have not opened the eyes of the blind, they have at least given great encouragement to the short-sighted, and while their leaders may have all the inexperience of old age, their young men are far too wise to be ever sensible.  Yet they will insist on treating painting as if it were a mode of autobiography invented for the use of the illiterate, and are always prating to us on their coarse gritty canvases of their unnecessary selves and their unnecessary opinions, and spoiling by a vulgar over-emphasis that fine contempt of nature which is the best and only modest thing about them.  One tires, at the end, of the work of individuals whose individuality is always noisy, and generally uninteresting.  There is far more to be said in favour of that newer school at Paris, the _Archaicistes_, as they call themselves, who, refusing to leave the artist entirely at the mercy of the weather, do not find the ideal of art in mere atmospheric effect, but seek rather for the imaginative beauty of design and the loveliness of fair colour, and rejecting the tedious realism of those who merely paint what they see, try to see something worth seeing, and to see it not merely with actual and physical vision, but with that nobler vision of the soul which is as far wider in spiritual scope as it is far more splendid in artistic purpose.  They, at any rate, work under those decorative conditions that each art requires for its perfection, and have sufficient 'sthetic instinct to regret those sordid and stupid limitations of absolute modernity of form which have proved the ruin of so many of the Impressionists.  Still, the art that is frankly decorative is the art to live with.  It is, of all our visible arts, the one art that creates in us both mood and temperament.  Mere colour, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.  The harmony that resides in the delicate proportions of lines and masses becomes mirrored in the mind.  The repetitions of pattern give us rest.  The marvels of design stir the imagination.  In the mere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent elements of culture.  Nor is this all.  By its deliberate rejection of Nature as the ideal of beauty, as well as of the imitative method of the ordinary painter, decorative art not merely prepares the soul for the reception of true imaginative work, but develops in it that sense of form which is the basis of creative no less than of critical achievement.  For the real artist is he who proceeds, not from feeling to form, but from form to thought and passion.  He does not first conceive an idea, and then say to himself, ?I will put my idea into a complex metre of fourteen lines,? but, realising the beauty of the sonnet-scheme, he conceives certain modes of music and methods of rhyme, and the mere form suggests what is to fill it and make it intellectually and emotionally complete.  From time to time the world cries out against some charming artistic poet, because, to use its hackneyed and silly phrase, he has ?nothing to say.? But if he had something to say, he would probably say it, and the result would be tedious.  It is just because he has no new message, that he can do beautiful work.  He gains his inspiration from form, and from form purely, as an artist should.  A real passion would ruin him.  Whatever actually occurs is spoiled for art.  All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.  To be natural is to be obvious, and to be obvious is to be inartistic.  ERNEST.  I wonder do you really believe what you say?  GILBERT.  Why should you wonder?  It is not merely in art that the body is the soul.  In every sphere of life Form is the beginning of things. The rhythmic harmonious gestures of dancing convey, Plato tells us, both rhythm and harmony into the mind.  Forms are the food of faith, cried Newman in one of those great moments of sincerity that make us admire and know the man.  He was right, though he may not have known how terribly right he was.  The Creeds are believed, not because they are rational, but because they are repeated.  Yes: Form is everything.  It is the secret of life.  Find expression for a sorrow, and it will become dear to you.  Find expression for a joy, and you intensify its ecstasy.  Do you wish to love?  Use Love's Litany, and the words will create the yearning from which the world fancies that they spring.  Have you a grief that corrodes your heart?  Steep yourself in the Language of grief, learn its utterance from Prince Hamlet and Queen Constance, and you will find that mere expression is a mode of consolation, and that Form, which is the birth of passion, is also the death of pain.  And so, to return to the sphere of Art, it is Form that creates not merely the critical temperament, but also the 'sthetic instinct, that unerring instinct that reveals to one all things under their conditions of beauty.  Start with the worship of form, and there is no secret in art that will not be revealed to you, and remember that in criticism, as in creation, temperament is everything, and that it is, not by the time of their production, but by the temperaments to which they appeal, that the schools of art should be historically grouped.  ERNEST.  Your theory of education is delightful.  But what influence will your critic, brought up in these exquisite surroundings, possess?  Do you really think that any artist is ever affected by criticism?  GILBERT.  The influence of the critic will be the mere fact of his own existence.  He will represent the flawless type.  In him the culture of the century will see itself realised.  You must not ask of him to have any aim other than the perfecting of himself.  The demand of the intellect, as has been well said, is simply to feel itself alive.  The critic may, indeed, desire to exercise influence; but, if so, he will concern himself not with the individual, but with the age, which he will seek to wake into consciousness, and to make responsive, creating in it new desires and appetites, and lending it his larger vision and his nobler moods.  The actual art of to-day will occupy him less than the art of to-morrow, far less than the art of yesterday, and as for this or that person at present toiling away, what do the industrious matter?  They do their best, no doubt, and consequently we get the worst from them.  It is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done.  And besides, my dear Ernest, when a man reaches the age of forty, or becomes a Royal Academician, or is elected a member of the Athen?um Club, or is recognised as a popular novelist, whose books are in great demand at suburban railway stations, one may have the amusement of exposing him, but one cannot have the pleasure of reforming him.  And this is, I dare say, very fortunate for him; for I have no doubt that reformation is a much more painful process than punishment, is indeed punishment in its most aggravated and moral form?a fact which accounts for our entire failure as a community to reclaim that interesting phenomenon who is called the confirmed criminal.  ERNEST.  But may it not be that the poet is the best judge of poetry, and the painter of painting?  Each art must appeal primarily to the artist who works in it.  His judgment will surely be the most valuable?  GILBERT.  The appeal of all art is simply to the artistic temperament. Art does not address herself to the specialist.  Her claim is that she is universal, and that in all her manifestations she is one.  Indeed, so far from its being true that the artist is the best judge of art, a really great artist can never judge of other people's work at all, and can hardly, in fact, judge of his own.  That very concentration of vision that makes a man an artist, limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of fine appreciation.  The energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his own goal.  The wheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around him.  The gods are hidden from each other.  They can recognise their worshippers.  That is all.  ERNEST.  You say that a great artist cannot recognise the beauty of work different from his own.  GILBERT.  It is impossible for him to do so.  Wordsworth saw in _Endymion_ merely a pretty piece of Paganism, and Shelley, with his dislike of actuality, was deaf to Wordsworth's message, being repelled by its form, and Byron, that great passionate human incomplete creature, could appreciate neither the poet of the cloud nor the poet of the lake, and the wonder of Keats was hidden from him.  The realism of Euripides was hateful to Sophokles.  Those droppings of warm tears had no music for him.  Milton, with his sense of the grand style, could not understand |2
67|the method of Shakespeare, any more than could Sir Joshua the method of Gainsborough.  Bad artists always admire each other's work.  They call it being large-minded and free from prejudice.  But a truly great artist cannot conceive of life being shown, or beauty fashioned, under any conditions other than those that he has selected.  Creation employs all its critical faculty within its own sphere.  It may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others.  It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge of it.  ERNEST.  Do you really mean that?  GILBERT.  Yes, for creation limits, while contemplation widens, the vision.  ERNEST.  But what about technique?  Surely each art has its separate technique?  GILBERT.  Certainly: each art has its grammar and its materials.  There is no mystery about either, and the incompetent can always be correct. But, while the laws upon which Art rests may be fixed and certain, to find their true realisation they must be touched by the imagination into such beauty that they will seem an exception, each one of them. Technique is really personality.  That is the reason why the artist cannot teach it, why the pupil cannot learn it, and why the 'sthetic critic can understand it.  To the great poet, there is only one method of music?his own.  To the great painter, there is only one manner of painting?that which he himself employs.  The 'sthetic critic, and the 'sthetic critic alone, can appreciate all forms and modes.  It is to him that Art makes her appeal.  ERNEST.  Well, I think I have put all my questions to you.  And now I must admit?  GILBERT.  Ah! don?t say that you agree with me.  When people agree with me I always feel that I must be wrong.  ERNEST.  In that case I certainly won?t tell you whether I agree with you or not.  But I will put another question.  You have explained to me that criticism is a creative art.  What future has it?  GILBERT.  It is to criticism that the future belongs.  The subject-matter at the disposal of creation becomes every day more limited in extent and variety.  Providence and Mr. Walter Besant have exhausted the obvious. If creation is to last at all, it can only do so on the condition of becoming far more critical than it is at present.  The old roads and dusty highways have been traversed too often.  Their charm has been worn away by plodding feet, and they have lost that element of novelty or surprise which is so essential for romance.  He who would stir us now by fiction must either give us an entirely new background, or reveal to us the soul of man in its innermost workings.  The first is for the moment being done for us by Mr. Rudyard Kipling.  As one turns over the pages of his _Plain Tales from the Hills_, one feels as if one were seated under a palm-tree reading life by superb flashes of vulgarity.  The bright colours of the bazaars dazzle one's eyes.  The jaded, second-rate Anglo-Indians are in exquisite incongruity with their surroundings.  The mere lack of style in the story-teller gives an odd journalistic realism to what he tells us.  From the point of view of literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates.  From the point of view of life, he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it. Dickens knew its clothes and its comedy.  Mr. Kipling knows its essence and its seriousness.  He is our first authority on the second-rate, and has seen marvellous things through keyholes, and his backgrounds are real works of art.  As for the second condition, we have had Browning, and Meredith is with us.  But there is still much to be done in the sphere of introspection.  People sometimes say that fiction is getting too morbid. As far as psychology is concerned, it has never been morbid enough.  We have merely touched the surface of the soul, that is all.  In one single ivory cell of the brain there are stored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have dreamed of, who, like the author of _Le Rouge et le Noir_, have sought to track the soul into its most secret places, and to make life confess its dearest sins.  Still, there is a limit even to the number of untried backgrounds, and it is possible that a further development of the habit of introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it seeks to supply fresh material.  I myself am inclined to think that creation is doomed.  It springs from too primitive, too natural an impulse.  However this may be, it is certain that the subject-matter at the disposal of creation is always diminishing, while the subject-matter of criticism increases daily. There are always new attitudes for the mind, and new points of view.  The duty of imposing form upon chaos does not grow less as the world advances.  There was never a time when Criticism was more needed than it is now.  It is only by its means that Humanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrived.  Hours ago, Ernest, you asked me the use of Criticism.  You might just as well have asked me the use of thought.  It is Criticism, as Arnold points out, that creates the intellectual atmosphere of the age.  It is Criticism, as I hope to point out myself some day, that makes the mind a fine instrument.  We, in our educational system, have burdened the memory with a load of unconnected facts, and laboriously striven to impart our laboriously-acquired knowledge.  We teach people how to remember, we never teach them how to grow.  It has never occurred to us to try and develop in the mind a more subtle quality of apprehension and discernment.  The Greeks did this, and when we come in contact with the Greek critical intellect, we cannot but be conscious that, while our subject-matter is in every respect larger and more varied than theirs, theirs is the only method by which this subject-matter can be interpreted.  England has done one thing; it has invented and established Public Opinion, which is an attempt to organise the ignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force.  But Wisdom has always been hidden from it.  Considered as an instrument of thought, the English mind is coarse and undeveloped.  The only thing that can purify it is the growth of the critical instinct.  It is Criticism, again, that, by concentration, makes culture possible. It takes the cumbersome mass of creative work, and distils it into a finer essence.  Who that desires to retain any sense of form could struggle through the monstrous multitudinous books that the world has produced, books in which thought stammers or ignorance brawls?  The thread that is to guide us across the wearisome labyrinth is in the hands of Criticism.  Nay more, where there is no record, and history is either lost, or was never written, Criticism can re-create the past for us from the very smallest fragment of language or art, just as surely as the man of science can from some tiny bone, or the mere impress of a foot upon a rock, re-create for us the winged dragon or Titan lizard that once made the earth shake beneath its tread, can call Behemoth out of his cave, and make Leviathan swim once more across the startled sea.  Prehistoric history belongs to the philological and arch?ological critic.  It is to him that the origins of things are revealed.  The self-conscious deposits of an age are nearly always misleading.  Through philological criticism alone we know more of the centuries of which no actual record has been preserved, than we do of the centuries that have left us their scrolls. It can do for us what can be done neither by physics nor metaphysics.  It can give us the exact science of mind in the process of becoming.  It can do for us what History cannot do.  It can tell us what man thought before he learned how to write.  You have asked me about the influence of Criticism.  I think I have answered that question already; but there is this also to be said.  It is Criticism that makes us cosmopolitan.  The Manchester school tried to make men realise the brotherhood of humanity, by pointing out the commercial advantages of peace.  It sought to degrade the wonderful world into a common market-place for the buyer and the seller.  It addressed itself to the lowest instincts, and it failed.  War followed upon war, and the tradesman's creed did not prevent France and Germany from clashing together in blood-stained battle.  There are others of our own day who seek to appeal to mere emotional sympathies, or to the shallow dogmas of some vague system of abstract ethics.  They have their Peace Societies, so dear to the sentimentalists, and their proposals for unarmed International Arbitration, so popular among those who have never read history.  But mere emotional sympathy will not do.  It is too variable, and too closely connected with the passions; and a board of arbitrators who, for the general welfare of the race, are to be deprived of the power of putting their decisions into execution, will not be of much avail.  There is only one thing worse than Injustice, and that is Justice without her sword in her hand.  When Right is not Might, it is Evil.  No: the emotions will not make us cosmopolitan, any more than the greed for gain could do so.  It is only by the cultivation of the habit of intellectual criticism that we shall be able to rise superior to race-prejudices.  Goethe?you will not misunderstand what I say?was a German of the Germans.  He loved his country?no man more so.  Its people were dear to him; and he led them.  Yet, when the iron hoof of Napoleon trampled upon vineyard and cornfield, his lips were silent.  ?How can one write songs of hatred without hating?? he said to Eckermann, ?and how could I, to whom culture and barbarism are alone of importance, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of the earth and to which I owe so great a part of my own cultivation??  This note, sounded in the modern world by Goethe first, will become, I think, the starting point for the cosmopolitanism of the future.  Criticism will annihilate race-prejudices, by insisting upon the unity of the human mind in the variety of its forms.  If we are tempted to make war upon another nation, we shall remember that we are seeking to destroy an element of our own culture, and possibly its most important element.  As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination.  When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.  The change will of course be slow, and people will not be conscious of it.  They will not say ?We will not war against France because her prose is perfect,? but because the prose of France is perfect, they will not hate the land. Intellectual criticism will bind Europe together in bonds far closer than those that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist.  It will give us the peace that springs from understanding.  Nor is this all.  It is Criticism that, recognising no position as final, and refusing to bind itself by the shallow shibboleths of any sect or school, creates that serene philosophic temper which loves truth for its own sake, and loves it not the less because it knows it to be unattainable.  How little we have of this temper in England, and how much we need it!  The English mind is always in a rage.  The intellect of the race is wasted in the sordid and stupid quarrels of second-rate politicians or third-rate theologians.  It was reserved for a man of science to show us the supreme example of that 'sweet reasonableness? of which Arnold spoke so wisely, and, alas! to so little effect.  The author of the _Origin of Species_ had, at any rate, the philosophic temper.  If one contemplates the ordinary pulpits and platforms of England, one can but feel the contempt of Julian, or the indifference of Montaigne.  We are dominated by the fanatic, whose worst vice is his sincerity. Anything approaching to the free play of the mind is practically unknown amongst us.  People cry out against the sinner, yet it is not the sinful, but the stupid, who are our shame.  There is no sin except stupidity.  ERNEST.  Ah! what an antinomian you are!  GILBERT.  The artistic critic, like the mystic, is an antinomian always. To be good, according to the vulgar standard of goodness, is obviously quite easy.  It merely requires a certain amount of sordid terror, a certain lack of imaginative thought, and a certain low passion for middle-class respectability.  'sthetics are higher than ethics.  They belong to a more spiritual sphere.  To discern the beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.  Even a colour-sense is more important, in the development of the individual, than a sense of right and wrong.  'sthetics, in fact, are to Ethics in the sphere of conscious civilisation, what, in the sphere of the external world, sexual is to natural selection.  Ethics, like natural selection, make existence possible.  'sthetics, like sexual selection, make life lovely and wonderful, fill it with new forms, and give it progress, and variety and change.  And when we reach the true culture that is our aim, we attain to that perfection of which the saints have dreamed, the perfection of those to whom sin is impossible, not because they make the renunciations of the ascetic, but because they can do everything they wish without hurt to the soul, and can wish for nothing that can do the soul harm, the soul being an entity so divine that it is able to transform into elements of a richer experience, or a finer susceptibility, or a newer mode of thought, acts or passions that with the common would be commonplace, or with the uneducated ignoble, or with the shameful vile.  Is this dangerous?  Yes; it is dangerous?all ideas, as I told you, are so.  But the night wearies, and the light flickers in the lamp.  One more thing I cannot help saying to you.  You have spoken against Criticism as being a sterile thing.  The nineteenth century is a turning point in history, simply on account of the work of two men, Darwin and Renan, the one the critic of the Book of Nature, the other the critic of the books of God.  Not to recognise this is to miss the meaning of one of the most important eras in the progress of the world.  Creation is always behind the age.  It is Criticism that leads us.  The Critical Spirit and the World-Spirit are one.  ERNEST.  And he who is in possession of this spirit, or whom this spirit possesses, will, I suppose, do nothing?  GILBERT.  Like the Persephone of whom Landor tells us, the sweet pensive Persephone around whose white feet the asphodel and amaranth are blooming, he will sit contented ?in that deep, motionless quiet which mortals pity, and which the gods enjoy.?  He will look out upon the world and know its secret.  By contact with divine things he will become divine.  His will be the perfect life, and his only.  ERNEST.  You have told me many strange things to-night, Gilbert.  You have told me that it is more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it, and that to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world; you have told me that all Art is immoral, and all thought dangerous; that criticism is more creative than creation, and that the highest criticism is that which reveals in the work of Art what the artist had not put there; that it is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judge of it; and that the true critic is unfair, insincere, and not rational.  My friend, you are a dreamer.  GILBERT.  Yes: I am a dreamer.  For a dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.  ERNEST.  His punishment?  GILBERT.  And his reward.  But, see, it is dawn already.  Draw back the curtains and open the windows wide.  How cool the morning air is! Piccadilly lies at our feet like a long riband of silver.  A faint purple mist hangs over the Park, and the shadows of the white houses are purple. It is too late to sleep.  Let us go down to Covent Garden and look at the roses.  Come!  I am tired of thought.     THE TRUTH OF MASKS A NOTE ON ILLUSION   IN many of the somewhat violent attacks that have recently been made on that splendour of mounting which now characterises our Shakespearian revivals in England, it seems to have been tacitly assumed by the critics that Shakespeare himself was more or less indifferent to the costumes of his actors, and that, could he see Mrs. Langtry's production of _Antony and Cleopatra_, he would probably say that the play, and the play only, is the thing, and that everything else is leather and prunella.  While, as regards any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the _Nineteenth Century_, has laid it down as a dogma of art that arch?ology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of Shakespeare's plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.  Lord Lytton's position I shall examine later on; but, as regards the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study Shakespeare's method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare does himself.  Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great processions in _Henry the Eighth_, directions which are characterised by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn's hair.  Indeed it would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time, writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago, prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under Shakespeare's influence was attacked by the contemporary critics, not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.  The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his plays, such as _Measure for Measure_, _Twelfth Night_, _The Two Gentleman of Verona_, _All's Well that Ends Well_, _Cymbeline_, and others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in _Henry the Sixth_, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the _d?no?ment_ of the _Merry Wives of Windsor_ hinges on the colour of Anne Page's gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion under a peasant's garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot's rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired in ?all points as a man?; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father's house in boy's dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots, and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern: and as for Falstaff, does he not come on as a highwayman, as an old woman, as Herne the Hunter, and as the clothes going to the laundry?  Nor are the examples of the employment of costume as a mode of intensifying dramatic situation less numerous.  After slaughter of Duncan, Macbeth appears in his night-gown as if aroused from sleep; Timon ends in rags the play he had begun in splendour; Richard flatters the London citizens in a suit of mean and shabby armour, and, as soon as he has stepped in blood to the throne, marches through the streets in crown and George and Garter; the climax of _The Tempest_ is reached when Prospero, throwing off his enchanter's robes, sends Ariel for his hat and rapier, and reveals himself as the great Italian Duke; the very Ghost in _Hamlet_ changes his mystical apparel to produce different effects; and as for Juliet, a modern playwright would probably have laid her out in her shroud, and made the scene a scene of horror merely, but Shakespeare arrays her in rich and gorgeous raiment, whose loveliness makes the vault ?a feasting presence full of light,? turns the tomb into a bridal chamber, and gives the cue and motive for Romeo's speech of the triumph of Beauty over Death.  Even small details of dress, such as the colour of a major-domo's stockings, the pattern on a wife's handkerchief, the sleeve of a young soldier, and a fashionable woman's bonnets, become in Shakespeare's hands points of actual dramatic importance, and by some of them the action of the play in question is conditioned absolutely.  Many other dramatists have availed themselves of costume as a method of expressing directly to the audience the character of a person on his entrance, though hardly so brilliantly as Shakespeare has done in the case of the dandy Parolles, whose dress, by the way, only an arch?ologist can understand; the fun of a master and servant exchanging coats in presence of the audience, of shipwrecked sailors squabbling over the division of a lot of fine clothes, and of a tinker dressed up like a duke while he is in his cups, may be regarded as part of that great career which costume has always played in comedy from the time of Aristophanes down to Mr. Gilbert; but nobody from the mere details of apparel and adornment has ever drawn such irony of contrast, such immediate and tragic effect, such pity and such pathos, as Shakespeare himself.  Armed cap-?-pie, the dead King stalks on the battlements of Elsinore because all is not right with Denmark; Shylock's Jewish gaberdine is part of the stigma under which that wounded and embittered nature writhes; Arthur begging for his life can think of no better plea than the handkerchief he had given Hubert?  and Orlando's blood-stained napkin strikes the first sombre note in that exquisite woodland idyll, and shows us the depth of feeling that underlies Rosalind's fanciful wit and wilful jesting.   says Imogen, jesting on the loss of the bracelet which was already on its way to Rome to rob her of her husband's faith; the little Prince passing to the Tower plays with the dagger in his uncle's girdle; Duncan sends a ring to Lady Macbeth on the night of his own murder, and the ring of Portia turns the tragedy of the merchant into a wife's comedy.  The great rebel York dies with a paper crown on his head; Hamlet's black suit is a kind of colour-motive in the piece, like the mourning of the Chim?ne in the _Cid_; and the climax of Antony's speech is the production of C'sar's cloak:?  The flowers which Ophelia carries with her in her madness are as pathetic as the violets that blossom on a grave; the effect of Lear's wandering on the heath is intensified beyond words by his fantastic attire; and when Cloten, stung by the taunt of that simile which his sister draws from her husband's raiment, arrays himself in that husband's very garb to work upon her the deed of shame, we feel that there is nothing in the whole of modern French realism, nothing even in _Th?r'se Raquin_, that masterpiece of horror, which for terrible and tragic significance can compare with this strange scene in _Cymbeline_.  In the actual dialogue also some of the most vivid passages are those suggested by costume.  Rosalind's  Constance's  and the quick sharp cry of Elizabeth?  are only a few of the many examples one might quote.  One of the finest effects I have ever seen on the stage was Salvini, in the last act of _Lear_, tearing the plume from Kent's cap and applying it to Cordelia's lips when he came to the line,  Mr. Booth, whose Lear had many noble qualities of passion, plucked, I remember, some fur from his arch?ologically-incorrect ermine for the same business; but Salvini's was the finer effect of the two, as well as the truer.  And those who saw Mr. Irving in the last act of _Richard the Third_ have not, I am sure, forgotten how much the agony and terror of his dream was intensified, by contrast, through the calm and quiet that preceded it, and the delivery of such lines as  lines which had a double meaning for the audience, remembering the last words which Richard's mother called after him as he was marching to Bosworth:?  As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even now it is difficult to produce such a play as the _Comedy of Errors_; and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry's brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing _Twelfth Night_ adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare's on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.  For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each character.  ?Racine abhorre la r?alit?,? says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; ?il ne daigne pas s?occuper de son costume.  Si l?on s?en rapportait aux indications du po?te, Agamemnon serait v?tu d?un sceptre et Achille d?une ?p?e.?  But with Shakespeare it is very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in _Macbeth_, and the apothecary in _Romeo and Juliet_, several elaborate descriptions of his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green?a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were?and in white, with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.  Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the patterns on the Dauphin's armour and the Pucelle's sword, the crest on Warwick's helmet and the colour of Bardolph's nose.  Portia has golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek's hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won?t curl at all. Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces. Lear has a white beard, Hamlet's father a grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.  Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many di|2
68|fferent colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.  There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an ass's head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband and his wife's milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.  As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age, particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies? bonnets, and the many descriptions of the _mundus muliebris_, from the long of Autolycus in the _Winter's Tale_ down to the account of the Duchess of Milan's gown in _Much Ado About Nothing_, they are far too numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in Lear's scene with Edgar?a passage which has the advantage of brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing metaphysics of _Sartor Resartus_.  But I think that from what I have already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet's loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each: he has as much delight in Caliban as he has in Ariel, in rags as he has in cloth of gold, and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness.  The difficulty Ducis felt about translating _Othello_ in consequence of the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief, and his attempt to soften its grossness by making the Moor reiterate ?Le bandeau! le bandeau!? may be taken as an example of the difference between _la trag?die philosophique_ and the drama of real life; and the introduction for the first time of the word _mouchoir_ at the Th??tre Fran?ais was an era in that romantic-realistic movement of which Hugo is the father and M. Zola the _enfant terrible_, just as the classicism of the earlier part of the century was emphasised by Talma's refusal to play Greek heroes any longer in a powdered periwig?one of the many instances, by the way, of that desire for arch?ological accuracy in dress which has distinguished the great actors of our age.  In criticising the importance given to money in _La Com?die Humaine_, Th?ophile Gautier says that Balzac may claim to have invented a new hero in fiction, _le h?ros m?tallique_.  Of Shakespeare it may be said he was the first to see the dramatic value of doublets, and that a climax may depend on a crinoline.  The burning of the Globe Theatre?an event due, by the way, to the results of the passion for illusion that distinguished Shakespeare's stage-management?has unfortunately robbed us of many important documents; but in the inventory, still in existence, of the costume-wardrobe of a London theatre in Shakespeare's time, there are mentioned particular costumes for cardinals, shepherds, kings, clowns, friars, and fools; green coats for Robin Hood's men, and a green gown for Maid Marian; a white and gold doublet for Henry the Fifth, and a robe for Longshanks; besides surplices, copes, damask gowns, gowns of cloth of gold and of cloth of silver, taffeta gowns, calico gowns, velvet coats, satin coats, frieze coats, jerkins of yellow leather and of black leather, red suits, grey suits, French Pierrot suits, a robe ?for to goo invisibell,? which seems inexpensive at ?3, 10s., and four incomparable fardingales?all of which show a desire to give every character an appropriate dress.  There are also entries of Spanish, Moorish and Danish costumes, of helmets, lances, painted shields, imperial crowns, and papal tiaras, as well as of costumes for Turkish Janissaries, Roman Senators, and all the gods and goddesses of Olympus, which evidence a good deal of arch?ological research on the part of the manager of the theatre.  It is true that there is a mention of a bodice for Eve, but probably the _donn?e_ of the play was after the Fall.  Indeed, anybody who cares to examine the age of Shakespeare will see that arch?ology was one of its special characteristics.  After that revival of the classical forms of architecture which was one of the notes of the Renaissance, and the printing at Venice and elsewhere of the masterpieces of Greek and Latin literature, had come naturally an interest in the ornamentation and costume of the antique world.  Nor was it for the learning that they could acquire, but rather for the loveliness that they might create, that the artists studied these things.  The curious objects that were being constantly brought to light by excavations were not left to moulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator, and the _ennui_ of a policeman bored by the absence of crime.  They were used as motives for the production of a new art, which was to be not beautiful merely, but also strange.  Infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the Appian Way came across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name ?Julia, daughter of Claudius.?  On opening the coffer they found within its marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of age, preserved by the embalmer's skill from corruption and the decay of time. Her eyes were half open, her hair rippled round her in crisp curling gold, and from her lips and cheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet departed.  Borne back to the Capitol, she became at once the centre of a new cult, and from all parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at the wonderful shrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the secret of beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Jud?a's rough and rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away by night, and in secret buried.  Legend though it may be, yet the story is none the less valuable as showing us the attitude of the Renaissance towards the antique world.  Arch?ology to them was not a mere science for the antiquarian; it was a means by which they could touch the dry dust of antiquity into the very breath and beauty of life, and fill with the new wine of romanticism forms that else had been old and outworn.  From the pulpit of Niccola Pisano down to Mantegna's ?Triumph of C'sar,? and the service Cellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit can be traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts?the arts of arrested movement?but its influence was to be seen also in the great Gr?co-Roman masques which were the constant amusement of the gay courts of the time, and in the public pomps and processions with which the citizens of big commercial towns were wont to greet the princes that chanced to visit them; pageants, by the way, which were considered so important that large prints were made of them and published?a fact which is a proof of the general interest at the time in matters of such kind.  And this use of arch?ology in shows, so far from being a bit of priggish pedantry, is in every way legitimate and beautiful.  For the stage is not merely the meeting-place of all the arts, but is also the return of art to life.  Sometimes in an arch?ological novel the use of strange and obsolete terms seems to hide the reality beneath the learning, and I dare say that many of the readers of _Notre Dame de Paris_ have been much puzzled over the meaning of such expressions as _la casaque ? mahoitres_, _les voulgiers_, _le gallimard tach? d?encre_, _les craaquiniers_, and the like; but with the stage how different it is!  The ancient world wakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before our eyes, without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or an encyclop?dia for the perfection of our enjoyment.  Indeed, there is not the slightest necessity that the public should know the authorities for the mounting of any piece.  From such materials, for instance, as the disk of Theodosius, materials with which the majority of people are probably not very familiar, Mr. E. W. Godwin, one of the most artistic spirits of this century in England, created the marvellous loveliness of the first act of _Claudian_, and showed us the life of Byzantium in the fourth century, not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts, not by a novel which requires a glossary to explain it, but by the visible presentation before us of all the glory of that great town.  And while the costumes were true to the smallest points of colour and design, yet the details were not assigned that abnormal importance which they must necessarily be given in a piecemeal lecture, but were subordinated to the rules of lofty composition and the unity of artistic effect.  Mr. Symonds, speaking of that great picture of Mantegna's, now in Hampton Court, says that the artist has converted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of line.  The same could have been said with equal justice of Mr. Godwin's scene.  Only the foolish called it pedantry, only those who would neither look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play being killed by its paint.  It was in reality a scene not merely perfect in its picturesqueness, but absolutely dramatic also, getting rid of any necessity for tedious descriptions, and showing us, by the colour and character of Claudian's dress, and the dress of his attendants, the whole nature and life of the man, from what school of philosophy he affected, down to what horses he backed on the turf.  And indeed arch?ology is only really delightful when transfused into some form of art.  I have no desire to underrate the services of laborious scholars, but I feel that the use Keats made of Lempri?re's Dictionary is of far more value to us than Professor Max M?ller's treatment of the same mythology as a disease of language.  Better _Endymion_ than any theory, however sound, or, as in the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic among adjectives!  And who does not feel that the chief glory of Piranesi's book on Vases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his ?Ode on a Grecian Urn??  Art, and art only, can make arch?ology beautiful; and the theatric art can use it most directly and most vividly, for it can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of actual life with the wonder of the unreal world.  But the sixteenth century was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age of Vecellio also.  Every nation seems suddenly to have become interested in the dress of its neighbours.  Europe began to investigate its own clothes, and the amount of books published on national costumes is quite extraordinary. At the beginning of the century the _Nuremberg Chronicle_, with its two thousand illustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the century was over seventeen editions were published of Munster's _Cosmography_. Besides these two books there were also the works of Michael Colyns, of Hans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself, all of them well illustrated, some of the drawings in Vecellio being probably from the hand of Titian.  Nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired their knowledge.  The development of the habit of foreign travel, the increased commercial intercourse between countries, and the frequency of diplomatic missions, gave every nation many opportunities of studying the various forms of contemporary dress.  After the departure from England, for instance, of the ambassadors from the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of Morocco, Henry the Eighth and his friends gave several masques in the strange attire of their visitors.  Later on London saw, perhaps too often, the sombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came envoys from all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an important influence on English costume.  And the interest was not confined merely to classical dress, or the dress of foreign nations; there was also a good deal of research, amongst theatrical people especially, into the ancient costume of England itself: and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during his day, a play of _Richard The Third_ was performed, in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than Garrick's mounting of Shakespeare's own play on the subject, in which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third, Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young guardsman.  For what is the use to the stage of that arch?ology which has so strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in our country's history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess's Theatre, had the curtain risen on his father's Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair, attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no arch?ology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand arch?ology being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.  However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For arch?ology, being a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it.  We look to the arch?ologist for the materials, to the artist for the method.  In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare's plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama. This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it.  Most _Hamlets_ I have seen were placed far too early.  _Hamlet_ is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the arch?ologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to convert into effects.  It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a great deal of capital has been made out of Hector's indiscreet quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms are really few in number, and not very important, and, had Shakespeare's attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he would probably have corrected them. For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare's plays as a whole, however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his _dramatis person?_ are people who had actually existed, and some of them might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.  Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.  Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters, with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was written ?Domi mansit, lanam fecit,? as surely as Juliet is the romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is as entirely French as the heroine of _Divor?ons_.  Harry the Fifth is a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.  Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful he is to have his facts perfectly right?indeed he follows Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation, the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really necessary that the School Board children should know all about the Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare's own day this use of his plays was recognised.  ?The historical plays teach history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,? says Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than nineteenth-century primers are.  Of course the 'sthetic value of Shakespeare's plays does not, in the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth, and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting them at pleasure. But still Shakespeare's use of facts is a most interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.  Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing his plays with ?fairy tales,? as Lord Lytton does; for one of his aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which should deal with incidents with which the public was well acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.  Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art; but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth noticing that Shakespeare's first and last successes were both historical plays.  It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare's attitude towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method.  And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference to helmets of the period in the prologue to _Henry the Fifth_ may be considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen  where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along with the saddle of that ?imp of fame,? and the dinted shield with its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but the use of military tabards in _Henry the Sixth_ is a bit of pure arch?ology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and the King's own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his tomb in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare's day.  For, up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national museums of arch?ology, and in them were kept the armour and attire of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth's day tourists were brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles Brandon's huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of the historic antiquities. Canterbury can still show us the helm of the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old St. Paul's the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was hung up by Richmond himself.  In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so frequent in his plays, is drawn from arch?ology, and not from the military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on Warwick's helmet, of which such a point is made in _Henry the Sixth_, is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of Shakespeare's own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their place?a fashion which, as he tells us in _Henry the Eighth_, was borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be sure that arch?ology was employed, and as for the others I feel certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as arch?ological; and the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus??an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron??is clearly so.  Of the ?Athenian dress? by which Lysander is distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus, for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian, in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his electors; and on both of these points he enters into long disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and picturesque effects: indeed the gown of humility, the ?woolvish gown,? as Shakespeare calls it, is the central note of the play.  There are other cases I might quote, but this one is quite sufficient for my purpose; and it is evident from it at any rate that, in mounting a play in the accurate costume of the time, according to the best authorities, we are carrying out Shakespeare's own wishes and method.  Even if it were not so, there is no more reason that we should continue any imperfections which may be supposed to have characterised Shakespeare's stage mounting than that we should have Juliet played by a young man, or give up the advantage of changeable scenery.  A great work of dramatic art should not merely be made expressive of modern passion by means of the actor, but should be presented to us in the form most suitable to the modern spirit.  Racine produced his Roman plays in Louis Quatorze dress on a stage crowded with spectators; but we require different conditions for the enjoyment of his art.  Perfect accuracy of detail, for the sake of perfect illusion, is necessary for us.  What we have to see is that the details are not allowed to usurp the principal place.  They must be subordinate always to the general motive of the play.  But subordination in art does not mean disregard of truth; it means conversion of fact into effect, and assigning to each detail its proper relative value  This passage is interesting as coming from the first great French dramatist who employed arch?ology on the stage, and whose plays, though absolutely correct in detail, are known to all for their passion, not for their pedantry?for their life, not for their learning.  It is true that he has made certain concessions in the case of the employment of curious or strange expressions.  Ruy Blas talks of M, de Priego as 'sujet du roi? instead of ?noble du roi,? and Angelo Malipieri speaks of ?la croix rouge? instead of ?la croix de gueules.?  But they are concessions made to the public, or rather to a section of it.  ?J?en offre ici toute mes excuses aux spectateurs intelligents,? he says in a note to one of the plays; ?esp?rons qu?un jour un seigneur v?nitien pourra dire tout bonnement sans p?ril son blason sur le th??tre.  C?est un progr's qui viendra.?  And, though the description of the crest is not couched in accurate language, still the crest itself was accurately right.  It may, of course, be said that the public do not notice these things; upon the other hand, it should be remembered that Art has no other aim but her own perfection, and proceeds simply by her own laws, and that the play which Hamlet describes as being caviare to the general is a play he highly praises.  Besides, in England, at any rate, the public have undergone a transformation; there is far more appreciation of beauty now than there was a few years ago; and though they may not be familiar with the authorities and arch?ological data for what is shown to them, still they enjoy whatever loveliness they look at.  And this is the important thing. Better to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under a microscope.  Arch?ological accuracy is merely a condition of illusionist stage effect; it is not its quality.  And Lord Lytton's proposal that the dresses should merely be beautiful without being accurate is founded on a misapprehension of the nature of costume, and of its value on the stage. This value is twofold, picturesque and dramatic; the former depends on the colour of the dress, the latter on its design and character.  But so interwoven are the two that, whenever in our own day historical accuracy has been disregarded, and the various dresses in a play taken from different ages, the result has been that the stage |2
69|has been turned into that chaos of costume, that caricature of the centuries, the Fancy Dress Ball, to the entire ruin of all dramatic and picturesque effect.  For the dresses of one age do not artistically harmonise with the dresses of another: and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the king's fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the play, from John of Gaunt's reproaches down to Richard's own speech in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that Shakespeare examined Richard's tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to me certain from York's speech:?   For we can still discern on the King's robe his favourite badge?the sun issuing from a cloud.  In fact, in every age the social conditions are so exemplified in costume, that to produce a sixteenth-century play in fourteenth-century attire, or _vice versa_, would make the performance seem unreal because untrue.  And, valuable as beauty of effect on the stage is, the highest beauty is not merely comparable with absolute accuracy of detail, but really dependent on it.  To invent, an entirely new costume is almost impossible except in burlesque or extravaganza, and as for combining the dress of different centuries into one, the experiment would be dangerous, and Shakespeare's opinion of the artistic value of such a medley may be gathered from his incessant satire of the Elizabethan dandies for imagining that they were well dressed because they got their doublets in Italy, their hats in Germany, and their hose in France.  And it should be noted that the most lovely scenes that have been produced on our stage have been those that have been characterised by perfect accuracy, such as Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft's eighteenth-century revivals at the Haymarket, Mr. Irying's superb production of _Much Ado About Nothing_, and Mr. Barrett's _Claudian_.  Besides, and this is perhaps the most complete answer to Lord Lytton's theory, it must be remembered that neither in costume nor in dialogue is beauty the dramatist's primary aim at all.  The true dramatist aims first at what is characteristic, and no more desires that all his personages should be beautifully attired than he desires that they should all have beautiful natures or speak beautiful English.  The true dramatist, in fact, shows us life under the conditions of art, not art in the form of life.  The Greek dress was the loveliest dress the world has ever seen, and the English dress of the last century one of the most monstrous; yet we cannot costume a play by Sheridan as we would costume a play by Sophokles.  For, as Polonius says in his excellent lecture, a lecture to which I am glad to have the opportunity of expressing my obligations, one of the first qualities of apparel is its expressiveness.  And the affected style of dress in the last century was the natural characteristic of a society of affected manners and affected conversation?a characteristic which the realistic dramatist will highly value down to the smallest detail of accuracy, and the materials for which he can get only from arch?ology.  But it is not enough that a dress should be accurate; it must be also appropriate to the stature and appearance of the actor, and to his supposed condition, as well as to his necessary action in the play.  In Mr. Hare's production of _As You Like It_ at the St. James's Theatre, for instance, the whole point of Orlando's complaint that he is brought up like a peasant, and not like a gentleman, was spoiled by the gorgeousness of his dress, and the splendid apparel worn by the banished Duke and his friends was quite out of place.  Mr. Lewis Wingfield's explanation that the sumptuary laws of the period necessitated their doing so, is, I am afraid, hardly sufficient.  Outlaws, lurking in a forest and living by the chase, are not very likely to care much about ordinances of dress. They were probably attired like Robin Hood's men, to whom, indeed, they are compared in the course of the play.  And that their dress was not that of wealthy noblemen may be seen by Orlando's words when he breaks in upon them.  He mistakes them for robbers, and is amazed to find that they answer him in courteous and gentle terms.  Lady Archibald Campbell's production, under Mr. E. W. Godwin's direction, of the same play in Coombe Wood was, as regards mounting, far more artistic.  At least it seemed so to me.  The Duke and his companions were dressed in serge tunics, leathern jerkins, high boots and gauntlets, and wore bycocket hats and hoods.  And as they were playing in a real forest, they found, I am sure, their dresses extremely convenient.  To every character in the play was given a perfectly appropriate attire, and the brown and green of their costumes harmonised exquisitely with the ferns through which they wandered, the trees beneath which they lay, and the lovely English landscape that surrounded the Pastoral Players.  The perfect naturalness of the scene was due to the absolute accuracy and appropriateness of everything that was worn.  Nor could arch?ology have been put to a severer test, or come out of it more triumphantly.  The whole production showed once for all that, unless a dress is arch?ologically correct, and artistically appropriate, it always looks unreal, unnatural, and theatrical in the sense of artificial.  Nor, again, is it enough that there should be accurate and appropriate costumes of beautiful colours; there must be also beauty of colour on the stage as a whole, and as long as the background is painted by one artist, and the foreground figures independently designed by another, there is the danger of a want of harmony in the scene as a picture.  For each scene the colour-scheme should be settled as absolutely as for the decoration of a room, and the textures which it is proposed to use should be mixed and re-mixed in every possible combination, and what is discordant removed.  Then, as regards the particular kinds of colours, the stage is often too glaring, partly through the excessive use of hot, violent reds, and partly through the costumes looking too new. Shabbiness, which in modern life is merely the tendency of the lower orders towards tone, is not without its artistic value, and modern colours are often much improved by being a little faded.  Blue also is too frequently used: it is not merely a dangerous colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will not wait so long for a colour. Peacock blue, of course, has been employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage; but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in _Hamlet_ as the central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire says, ?Nous c?l?brons tous quelque enterrement.?  The arch?ologist of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can separate and harmonise colours. In modern plays the black frock-coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a suitable background.  But it rarely is. Indeed the only good background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the _Princesse Georges_ in Mrs. Langtry's production.  As a rule, the hero is smothered in _bric-?-brac_ and palm-trees, lost in the gilded abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing the whole production. The facts of art are diverse, but the essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic production should bear the impress of one master, and one master only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to be worn.  Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of _Hernani_, absolutely refused to call her lover ?_Mon Lion_!? unless she was allowed to wear a little fashionable _toque_ then much in vogue on the Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but these wicked things should not be allowed. And there should be far more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr. Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans always went about bareheaded in the open air?a mistake the Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well as gowns to their Roman senators.  More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century, for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not at home in his part.  Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for beauty's sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to point out is that arch?ology is not a pedantic method, but a method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them, indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  _Pour ?tre plus difficile_, _la t?che n?en est que plus glorieuse_.  And if they will not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree. The essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in 'sthetic criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can realise Hegel's system of contraries.  The truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks.  H?LAS!      TO _drift with every passion till my soul_    _Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play_,    _Is it for this that I have given away_    _Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control_?    _Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll_    _Scrawled over on some boyish holiday_    _With idle songs for pipe and virelay_,    _Which do but mar the secret of the whole_.    _Surely there was a time I might have trod_    _The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance_    _Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God_:    _Is that time dead_? _lo_! _with a little rod_    _I did but touch the honey of romance_?    _And must I lose a soul's inheritance_?    ELEUTHERIA   SONNET TO LIBERTY      NOT that I love thy children, whose dull eyes    See nothing save their own unlovely woe,    Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,?    But that the roar of thy Democracies,    Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,    Mirror my wildest passions like the sea    And give my rage a brother?!  Liberty!    For this sake only do thy dissonant cries    Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings    By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades    Rob nations of their rights inviolate    And I remain unmoved?and yet, and yet,    These Christs that die upon the barricades,    God knows it I am with them, in some things.   AVE IMPERATRIX      SET in this stormy Northern sea,       Queen of these restless fields of tide,    England! what shall men say of thee,       Before whose feet the worlds divide?     The earth, a brittle globe of glass,       Lies in the hollow of thy hand,    And through its heart of crystal pass,       Like shadows through a twilight land,     The spears of crimson-suited war,       The long white-crested waves of fight,    And all the deadly fires which are       The torches of the lords of Night.     The yellow leopards, strained and lean,       The treacherous Russian knows so well,    With gaping blackened jaws are seen       Leap through the hail of screaming shell.     The strong sea-lion of England's wars       Hath left his sapphire cave of sea,    To battle with the storm that mars       The stars of England's chivalry.     The brazen-throated clarion blows       Across the Pathan's reedy fen,    And the high steeps of Indian snows       Shake to the tread of arm?d men.     And many an Afghan chief, who lies       Beneath his cool pomegranate-trees,    Clutches his sword in fierce surmise       When on the mountain-side he sees     The fleet-foot Marri scout, who comes       To tell how he hath heard afar    The measured roll of English drums       Beat at the gates of Kandahar.     For southern wind and east wind meet       Where, girt and crowned by sword and fire,    England with bare and bloody feet       Climbs the steep road of wide empire.     O lonely Himalayan height,       Grey pillar of the Indian sky,    Where saw'st thou last in clanging flight       Our wing?d dogs of Victory?     The almond-groves of Samarcand,       Bokhara, where red lilies blow,    And Oxus, by whose yellow sand       The grave white-turbaned merchants go:     And on from thence to Ispahan,       The gilded garden of the sun,    Whence the long dusty caravan       Brings cedar wood and vermilion;     And that dread city of Cabool       Set at the mountain's scarp?d feet,    Whose marble tanks are ever full       With water for the noonday heat:     Where through the narrow straight Bazaar       A little maid Circassian    Is led, a present from the Czar       Unto some old and bearded khan,?     Here have our wild war-eagles flown,       And flapped wide wings in fiery fight;    But the sad dove, that sits alone       In England'she hath no delight.     In vain the laughing girl will lean       To greet her love with love-lit eyes:    Down in some treacherous black ravine,       Clutching his flag, the dead boy lies.     And many a moon and sun will see       The lingering wistful children wait    To climb upon their father's knee;       And in each house made desolate     Pale women who have lost their lord       Will kiss the relics of the slain?    Some tarnished epaulette'some sword?       Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain.     For not in quiet English fields       Are these, our brothers, lain to rest,    Where we might deck their broken shields       With all the flowers the dead love best.     For some are by the Delhi walls,       And many in the Afghan land,    And many where the Ganges falls       Through seven mouths of shifting sand.     And some in Russian waters lie,       And others in the seas which are    The portals to the East, or by       The wind-swept heights of Trafalgar.     O wandering graves!  O restless sleep!       O silence of the sunless day!    O still ravine!  O stormy deep!       Give up your prey!  Give up your prey!     And thou whose wounds are never healed,       Whose weary race is never won,    O Cromwell's England! must thou yield       For every inch of ground a son?     Go! crown with thorns thy gold-crowned head,       Change thy glad song to song of pain;    Wind and wild wave have got thy dead,       And will not yield them back again.     Wave and wild wind and foreign shore       Possess the flower of English land?    Lips that thy lips shall kiss no more,       Hands that shall never clasp thy hand.     What profit now that we have bound       The whole round world with nets of gold,    If hidden in our heart is found       The care that groweth never old?     What profit that our galleys ride,       Pine-forest-like, on every main?    Ruin and wreck are at our side,       Grim warders of the House of Pain.     Where are the brave, the strong, the fleet?       Where is our English chivalry?    Wild grasses are their burial-sheet,       And sobbing waves their threnody.     O loved ones lying far away,       What word of love can dead lips send!    O wasted dust!  O senseless clay!       Is this the end! is this the end!     Peace, peace! we wrong the noble dead       To vex their solemn slumber so;    Though childless, and with thorn-crowned head,       Up the steep road must England go,     Yet when this fiery web is spun,       Her watchmen shall descry from far    The young Republic like a sun       Rise from these crimson seas of war.   TO MILTON      MILTON!  I think thy spirit hath passed away    From these white cliffs and high-embattled towers;       This gorgeous fiery-coloured world of ours    Seems fallen into ashes dull and grey,    And the age changed unto a mimic play       Wherein we waste our else too-crowded hours:       For all our pomp and pageantry and powers    We are but fit to delve the common clay,    Seeing this little isle on which we stand,       This England, this sea-lion of the sea,       By ignorant demagogues is held in fee,    Who love her not: Dear God! is this the land       Which bare a triple empire in her hand       When Cromwell spake the word Democracy!   LOUIS NAPOLEON      EAGLE of Austerlitz! where were thy wings       When far away upon a barbarous strand,       In fight unequal, by an obscure hand,    Fell the last scion of thy brood of Kings!     Poor boy! thou shalt not flaunt thy cloak of red,       Or ride in state through Paris in the van       Of thy returning legions, but instead    Thy mother France, free and republican,     Shall on thy dead and crownless forehead place       The better laurels of a soldier's crown,       That not dishonoured should thy soul go down    To tell the mighty Sire of thy race     That France hath kissed the mouth of Liberty,       And found it sweeter than his honied bees,       And that the giant wave Democracy    Breaks on the shores where Kings lay couched at ease.   SONNET                 ON THE MASSACRE OF THE CHRISTIANS IN BULGARIA     CHRIST, dost Thou live indeed? or are Thy bones    Still straitened in their rock-hewn sepulchre?    And was Thy Rising only dreamed by her    Whose love of Thee for all her sin atones?    For here the air is horrid with men's groans,    The priests who call upon Thy name are slain,    Dost Thou not hear the bitter wail of pain    From those whose children lie upon the stones?    Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom    Curtains the land, and through the starless night    Over Thy Cross a Crescent moon I see!    If Thou in very truth didst burst the tomb    Come down, O Son of Man! and show Thy might    Lest Mahomet be crowned instead of Thee!   QUANTUM MUTATA      THERE was a time in Europe long ago       When no man died for freedom anywhere,       But England's lion leaping from its lair    Laid hands on the oppressor! it was so    While England could a great Republic show.       Witness the men of Piedmont, chiefest care       Of Cromwell, when with impotent despair    The Pontiff in his painted portico    Trembled before our stern ambassadors.       How comes it then that from such high estate       We have thus fallen, save that Luxury    With barren merchandise piles up the gate    Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by:       Else might we still be Milton's heritors.   LIBERTATIS SACRA FAMES      ALBEIT nurtured in democracy,       And liking best that state republican       Where every man is Kinglike and no man    Is crowned above his fellows, yet I see,    Spite of this modern fret for Liberty,       Better the rule of One, whom all obey,       Than to let clamorous demagogues betray    Our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.    Wherefore I love them not whose hands profane       Plant the red flag upon the piled-up street       For no right cause, beneath whose ignorant reign    Arts, Culture, Reverence, Honour, all things fade,       Save Treason and the dagger of her trade,       Or Murder with his silent bloody feet.   THEORETIKOS      THIS mighty empire hath but feet of clay:       Of all its ancient chivalry and might       Our little island is forsaken quite:    Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay,    And from its hills that voice hath passed away       Which spake of Freedom: O come out of it,       Come out of it, my Soul, thou art not fit    For this vile traffic-house, where day by day       Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart,       And the rude people rage with ignorant cries    Against an heritage of centuries.       It mars my calm: wherefore in dreams of Art       And loftiest culture I would stand apart,    Neither for God, nor for his enemies.    THE GARDEN OF EROS      IT is full summer now, the heart of June;       Not yet the sunburnt reapers are astir    Upon the upland meadow where too soon       Rich autumn time, the season's usurer,    Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,    And see his treasure scattered by the wild and spendthrift breeze.     Too soon indeed! yet here the daffodil,       That love-child of the Spring, has lingered on    To vex the rose with jealousy, and still       The harebell spreads her azure pavilion,    And like a strayed and wandering reveller    Abandoned of its brothers, whom long since June's messenger     The missel-thrush has frighted from the glade,       One pale narcissus loiters fearfully    Close to a shadowy nook, where half afraid       Of their own loveliness some violets lie    That will not look the gold sun in the face    For fear of too much splendour,?ah! methinks it is a place     Which should be trodden by Persephone       When wearied of the flowerless fields of Dis!    Or danced on by the lads of Arcady!       The hidden secret of eternal bliss    Known to the Grecian here a man might find,    Ah! you and I may find it now if Love and Sleep be kind.     There are the flowers which mourning Herakles       Strewed on the tomb of Hylas, columbine,    Its white doves all a-flutter where the breeze       Kissed them too harshly, the small celandine,    That yellow-kirtled chorister of eve,    And lilac lady's-smock,?but let them bloom alone, and leave     Yon spir?d hollyhock red-crocketed       To sway its silent chimes, else must the bee,    Its little bellringer, go seek instead       Some other pleasaunce; the anemone    That weeps at daybreak, like a silly girl    Before her love, and hardly lets the butterflies unfurl     Their painted wings beside it,?bid it pine       In pale virginity; the winter snow    Will suit it better than those lips of thine       Whose fires would but scorch it, rather go    And pluck that amorous flower which blooms alone,    Fed by the pander wind with dust of kisses not its own.     The trumpet-mouths of red convolvulus       So dear to maidens, creamy meadow-sweet    Whiter than Juno's throat and odorous       As all Arabia, hyacinths the feet    Of Huntress Dian would be loth to mar    For any dappled fawn,?pluck these, and those fond flowers which are     Fairer than what Queen Venus trod upon       Beneath the pines of Ida, eucharis,    That morning star which does not dread the sun,       And budding marjoram which but to kiss    Would sweeten Cyther?a's lips and make    Adonis jealous,?these for thy head,?and for thy girdle take     Yon curving spray of purple clematis       Whose gorgeous dye outflames the Tyrian King,    And foxgloves with their nodding chalices,       But that one narciss which the startled Spring    Let from her kirtle fall when first she heard    In her own woods the wild tempestuous song of summer's bird,     Ah! leave it for a subtle memory       Of those sweet tremulous days of rain and sun,    When April laughed between her tears to see       The early primrose with shy footsteps run    From the gnarled oak-tree roots till all the wold,    Spite of its brown and trampled leaves, grew bright with shimmering    gold.     Nay, pluck it too, it is not half so sweet       As thou thyself, my soul's idolatry!    And when thou art a-wearied at thy feet       Shall oxlips weave their brightest tapestry,    For thee the woodbine shall forget its pride    And veil its tangled whorls, and thou shalt walk on daisies pied.     And I will cut a reed by yonder spring       And make the wood-gods jealous, and old Pan    Wonder what young intruder dares to sing       In these still haunts, where never foot of man    Should tread at evening, lest he chance to spy    The marble limbs of Artemis and all her company.     And I will tell thee why the jacinth wears       Such dread embroidery of dolorous moan,    And why the hapless nightingale forbears       To sing her song at noon, but weeps alone    When the fleet swallow sleeps, and rich men feast,    And why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east.     And I will sing how sad Proserpina       Unto a grave and gloomy Lord was wed,    And lure the silver-breasted Helena       Back from the lotus meadows of the dead,    So shalt thou see that awful loveliness    For which two mighty Hosts met fearfully in war's abyss!     And then I?ll pipe to thee that Grecian tale       How Cynthia loves the lad Endymion,    And hidden in a grey and misty veil       Hies to the cliffs of Latmos once the Sun    Leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase    Of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace.     And |2
70|if my flute can breathe sweet melody,       We may behold Her face who long ago    Dwelt among men by the ?gean sea,       And whose sad house with pillaged portico    And friezeless wall and columns toppled down    Looms o?er the ruins of that fair and violet cinctured town.     Spirit of Beauty! tarry still awhile,       They are not dead, thine ancient votaries;    Some few there are to whom thy radiant smile       Is better than a thousand victories,    Though all the nobly slain of Waterloo    Rise up in wrath against them! tarry still, there are a few     Who for thy sake would give their manlihood       And consecrate their being; I at least    Have done so, made thy lips my daily food,       And in thy temples found a goodlier feast    Than this starved age can give me, spite of all    Its new-found creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical.     Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,       The woods of white Colonos are not here,    On our bleak hills the olive never blows,       No simple priest conducts his lowing steer    Up the steep marble way, nor through the town    Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.     Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,       Whose very name should be a memory    To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest       Beneath the Roman walls, and melody    Still mourns her sweetest lyre; none can play    The lute of Adonais: with his lips Song passed away.     Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left       One silver voice to sing his threnody,    But ah! too soon of it we were bereft       When on that riven night and stormy sea    Panthea claimed her singer as her own,    And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,     Save for that fiery heart, that morning star       Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye    Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war       The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy    Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring    The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,     And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,       And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot    In passionless and fierce virginity       Hunting the tusk?d boar, his honied lute    Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,    And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.     And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,       And sung the Galil?an's requiem,    That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine       He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him    Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,    And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.     Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,       It is not quenched the torch of poesy,    The star that shook above the Eastern hill       Holds unassailed its argent armoury    From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight?    O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,     Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer's child,       Dear heritor of Spenser's tuneful reed,    With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled       The weary soul of man in troublous need,    And from the far and flowerless fields of ice    Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise.     We know them all, Gudrun the strong men's bride,       Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,    How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,       And what enchantment held the king in thrall    When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers    That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,     Long listless summer hours when the noon       Being enamoured of a damask rose    Forgets to journey westward, till the moon       The pale usurper of its tribute grows    From a thin sickle to a silver shield    And chides its loitering car?how oft, in some cool grassy field     Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,       At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come    Almost before the blackbird finds a mate       And overstay the swallow, and the hum    Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,    Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,     And through their unreal woes and mimic pain       Wept for myself, and so was purified,    And in their simple mirth grew glad again;       For as I sailed upon that pictured tide    The strength and splendour of the storm was mine    Without the storm's red ruin, for the singer is divine;     The little laugh of water falling down       Is not so musical, the clammy gold    Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town       Has less of sweetness in it, and the old    Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady    Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.     Spirit of Beauty, tarry yet awhile!       Although the cheating merchants of the mart    With iron roads profane our lovely isle,       And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,    Ay! though the crowded factories beget    The blindworm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!     For One at least there is,?He bears his name       From Dante and the seraph Gabriel,?    Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame       To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,    Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien's snare,    And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,     Loves thee so well, that all the World for him       A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,    And Sorrow take a purple diadem,       Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair    Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be    Even in anguish beautiful;'such is the empery     Which Painters hold, and such the heritage       This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,    Being a better mirror of his age       In all his pity, love, and weariness,    Than those who can but copy common things,    And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.     But they are few, and all romance has flown,       And men can prophesy about the sun,    And lecture on his arrows?how, alone,       Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,    How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,    And that no more ?mid English reeds a Naiad shows her head.     Methinks these new Act?ons boast too soon       That they have spied on beauty; what if we    Have analysed the rainbow, robbed the moon       Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,    Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope    Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!     What profit if this scientific age       Burst through our gates with all its retinue    Of modern miracles!  Can it assuage       One lover's breaking heart? what can it do    To make one life more beautiful, one day    More godlike in its period? but now the Age of Clay     Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth       Hath borne again a noisy progeny    Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth       Hurls them against the august hierarchy    Which sat upon Olympus; to the Dust    They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must     Repair for judgment; let them, if they can,       From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,    Create the new Ideal rule for man!       Methinks that was not my inheritance;    For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul    Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.     Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away       Her visage from the God, and Hecate's boat    Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day       Blew all its torches out: I did not note    The waning hours, to young Endymions    Time's palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!     Mark how the yellow iris wearily       Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed    By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,       Who, like a blue vein on a girl's white wrist,    Sleeps on that snowy primrose of the night,    Which ?gins to flush with crimson shame, and die beneath the light.     Come let us go, against the pallid shield       Of the wan sky the almond blossoms gleam,    The corncrake nested in the unmown field       Answers its mate, across the misty stream    On fitful wing the startled curlews fly,    And in his sedgy bed the lark, for joy that Day is nigh,     Scatters the pearl?d dew from off the grass,       In tremulous ecstasy to greet the sun,    Who soon in gilded panoply will pass       Forth from yon orange-curtained pavilion    Hung in the burning east: see, the red rim    O?ertops the expectant hills! it is the God! for love of him     Already the shrill lark is out of sight,       Flooding with waves of song this silent dell,?    Ah! there is something more in that bird's flight       Than could be tested in a crucible!?    But the air freshens, let us go, why soon    The woodmen will be here; how we have lived this night of June!    ROSA MYSTICA   REQUIESCAT      TREAD lightly, she is near       Under the snow,    Speak gently, she can hear       The daisies grow.     All her bright golden hair       Tarnished with rust,    She that was young and fair       Fallen to dust.     Lily-like, white as snow,       She hardly knew    She was a woman, so       Sweetly she grew.     Coffin-board, heavy stone,       Lie on her breast,    I vex my heart alone,       She is at rest.     Peace, Peace, she cannot hear       Lyre or sonnet,    All my life's buried here,       Heap earth upon it.  AVIGNON.   SONNET ON APPROACHING ITALY      I REACHED the Alps: the soul within me burned,       Italia, my Italia, at thy name:       And when from out the mountain's heart I came    And saw the land for which my life had yearned,    I laughed as one who some great prize had earned:       And musing on the marvel of thy fame       I watched the day, till marked with wounds of flame    The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.    The pine-trees waved as waves a woman's hair,       And in the orchards every twining spray       Was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam:    But when I knew that far away at Rome       In evil bonds a second Peter lay,       I wept to see the land so very fair.  TURIN.   SAN MINIATO         SEE, I have climbed the mountain side       Up to this holy house of God,       Where once that Angel-Painter trod    Who saw the heavens opened wide,        And throned upon the crescent moon       The Virginal white Queen of Grace,?       Mary! could I but see thy face    Death could not come at all too soon.        O crowned by God with thorns and pain!       Mother of Christ!  O mystic wife!       My heart is weary of this life    And over-sad to sing again.        O crowned by God with love and flame!       O crowned by Christ the Holy One!       O listen ere the searching sun    Show to the world my sin and shame.   AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA      WAS this His coming!  I had hoped to see       A scene of wondrous glory, as was told       Of some great God who in a rain of gold    Broke open bars and fell on Danae:    Or a dread vision as when Semele       Sickening for love and unappeased desire       Prayed to see God's clear body, and the fire    Caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly:    With such glad dreams I sought this holy place,       And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand       Before this supreme mystery of Love:    Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face,       An angel with a lily in his hand,       And over both the white wings of a Dove.  FLORENCE.   ITALIA      ITALIA! thou art fallen, though with sheen       Of battle-spears thy clamorous armies stride       From the north Alps to the Sicilian tide!    Ay! fallen, though the nations hail thee Queen    Because rich gold in every town is seen,       And on thy sapphire-lake in tossing pride       Of wind-filled vans thy myriad galleys ride    Beneath one flag of red and white and green.    O Fair and Strong!  O Strong and Fair in vain!       Look southward where Rome's desecrated town       Lies mourning for her God-anointed King!    Look heaven-ward! shall God allow this thing?       Nay! but some flame-girt Raphael shall come down,       And smite the Spoiler with the sword of pain.  VENICE.   SONNET                         WRITTEN IN HOLY WEEK AT GENOA     I WANDERED through Scoglietto's far retreat,       The oranges on each o?erhanging spray       Burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day;    Some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet    Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet       Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay:       And the curved waves that streaked the great green bay    Laughed i? the sun, and life seemed very sweet.    Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear,       ?Jesus the son of Mary has been slain,       O come and fill His sepulchre with flowers.?    Ah, God!  Ah, God! those dear Hellenic hours       Had drowned all memory of Thy bitter pain,       The Cross, the Crown, the Soldiers and the Spear.   ROME UNVISITED                                        I.     THE corn has turned from grey to red,       Since first my spirit wandered forth       From the drear cities of the north,    And to Italia's mountains fled.     And here I set my face towards home,       For all my pilgrimage is done,       Although, methinks, yon blood-red sun    Marshals the way to Holy Rome.     O Blessed Lady, who dost hold       Upon the seven hills thy reign!       O Mother without blot or stain,    Crowned with bright crowns of triple gold!     O Roma, Roma, at thy feet       I lay this barren gift of song!       For, ah! the way is steep and long    That leads unto thy sacred street.                                       II.     AND yet what joy it were for me       To turn my feet unto the south,       And journeying towards the Tiber mouth    To kneel again at Fiesole!     And wandering through the tangled pines       That break the gold of Arno's stream,       To see the purple mist and gleam    Of morning on the Apennines     By many a vineyard-hidden home,       Orchard and olive-garden grey,       Till from the drear Campagna's way    The seven hills bear up the dome!                                      III.     A PILGRIM from the northern seas?       What joy for me to seek alone       The wondrous temple and the throne    Of him who holds the awful keys!     When, bright with purple and with gold       Come priest and holy cardinal,       And borne above the heads of all    The gentle Shepherd of the Fold.     O joy to see before I die       The only God-anointed king,       And hear the silver trumpets ring    A triumph as he passes by!     Or at the brazen-pillared shrine       Holds high the mystic sacrifice,       And shows his God to human eyes    Beneath the veil of bread and wine.                                       IV.     FOR lo, what changes time can bring!       The cycles of revolving years       May free my heart from all its fears,    And teach my lips a song to sing.     Before yon field of trembling gold       Is garnered into dusty sheaves,       Or ere the autumn's scarlet leaves    Flutter as birds adown the wold,     I may have run the glorious race,       And caught the torch while yet aflame,       And called upon the holy name    Of Him who now doth hide His face.  ARONA.   URBS SACRA ?TERNA      ROME! what a scroll of History thine has been;       In the first days thy sword republican       Ruled the whole world for many an age's span:    Then of the peoples wert thou royal Queen,    Till in thy streets the bearded Goth was seen;       And now upon thy walls the breezes fan       (Ah, city crowned by God, discrowned by man!)    The hated flag of red and white and green.    When was thy glory! when in search for power       Thine eagles flew to greet the double sun,       And the wild nations shuddered at thy rod?    Nay, but thy glory tarried for this hour,       When pilgrims kneel before the Holy One,       The prisoned shepherd of the Church of God.  MONTRE MARIO.   SONNET               ON HEARING THE DIES IR? SUNG IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL     NAY, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,    Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,       Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love    Than terrors of red flame and thundering.    The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring:       A bird at evening flying to its nest       Tells me of One who had no place of rest:    I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing.    Come rather on some autumn afternoon,       When red and brown are burnished on the leaves,       And the fields echo to the gleaner's song,    Come when the splendid fulness of the moon       Looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves,       And reap Thy harvest: we have waited long.   EASTER DAY      THE silver trumpets rang across the Dome:       The people knelt upon the ground with awe:       And borne upon the necks of men I saw,    Like some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.    Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,       And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,       Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head:    In splendour and in light the Pope passed home.    My heart stole back across wide wastes of years       To One who wandered by a lonely sea,       And sought in vain for any place of rest:    ?Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest.       I, only I, must wander wearily,       And bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.?   E TENEBRIS      COME down, O Christ, and help me! reach Thy hand,       For I am drowning in a stormier sea       Than Simon on Thy lake of Galilee:    The wine of life is spilt upon the sand,    My heart is as some famine-murdered land       Whence all good things have perished utterly,       And well I know my soul in Hell must lie    If I this night before God's throne should stand.    ?He sleeps perchance, or rideth to the chase,       Like Baal, when his prophets howled that name       From morn to noon on Carmel's smitten height.?    Nay, peace, I shall behold, before the night,       The feet of brass, the robe more white than flame,       The wounded hands, the weary human face.   VITA NUOVA      I STOOD by the unvintageable sea       Till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray;       The long red fires of the dying day    Burned in the west; the wind piped drearily;    And to the land the clamorous gulls did flee:       ?Alas!? I cried, ?my life is full of pain,       And who can garner fruit or golden grain    From these waste fields which travail ceaselessly!?    My nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw,       Nathless I threw them as my final cast       Into the sea, and waited for the end.    When lo! a sudden glory! and I saw       From the black waters of my tortured past       The argent splendour of white limbs ascend!   MADONNA MIA      A LILY-GIRL, not made for this world's pain,       With brown, soft hair close braided by her ears,       And longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears    Like bluest water seen through mists of rain:    Pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain,       Red underlip drawn in for fear of love,       And white throat, whiter than the silvered dove,    Through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein.    Yet, though my lips shall praise her without cease,       Even to kiss her feet I am not bold,       Being o?ershadowed by the wings of awe,    Like Dante, when he stood with Beatrice       Beneath the flaming Lion's breast, and saw       The seventh Crystal, and the Stair of Gold.   THE NEW HELEN      WHERE hast thou been since round the walls of Troy       The sons of God fought in that great emprise?          Why dost thou walk our common earth again?    Hast thou forgotten that impassioned boy,          His purple galley and his Tyrian men       And treacherous Aphrodite's mocking eyes?    For surely it was thou, who, like a star       Hung in the silver silence of the night,       Didst lure the Old World's chivalry and might    Into the clamorous crimson waves of war!     Or didst thou rule the fire-laden moon?       In amorous Sidon was thy temple built          Over the light and laughter of the sea       Where, behind lattice scarlet-wrought and gilt,          Some brown-limbed girl did weave thee tapestry,    All through the waste and wearied hours of noon;    Till her wan cheek with flame of passion burned,       And she rose up the sea-washed lips to kiss    Of some glad Cyprian sailor, safe returned       From Calp? and the cliffs of Herakles!     No! thou art Helen, and none other one!       It was for thee that young Sarped?n died,          And Memn?n's manhood was untimely spent;       It was for thee gold-crested Hector tried    With Thetis? child that evil race to run,          In the last year of thy beleaguerment;    Ay! even now the glory of thy fame       Burns in those fields of trampled asphodel,       Where the high lords whom Ilion knew so well    Clash ghostly shields, and call upon thy name.     Where hast thou been? in that enchanted land       Whose slumbering vales forlorn Calypso knew,          Where never mower rose at break of day       But all unswathed the trammelling grasses grew,    And the sad shepherd saw the tall corn stand          Till summer's red had changed to withered grey?    Didst thou lie there by some Leth?an stream       Deep brooding on thine ancient memory,       The crash of broken spears, the fiery gleam    From shivered helm, the Grecian battle-cry?     Nay, thou wert hidden in that hollow hill       With one who is forgotten utterly,          That discrowned Queen men call the Erycine;       Hidden away that never mightst thou see    The face of Her, before whose mouldering shrine          To-day at Rome the silent nations kneel;    Who gat from Love no joyous gladdening,       But only Love's intolerable pain,       Only a sword to pierce her heart in twain,    Only the bitterness of child-bearing.     The lotus-leaves which heal the wounds of Death       Lie in thy hand; O, be thou kind to me,          While yet I know the summer of my days;       For hardly can my tremulous lips draw breath    To fill the silver trumpet with thy praise,          So bowed am I before thy mystery;    So bowed and broken on Love's terrible wheel,       That I have lost all hope and heart to sing,       Yet care I not what ruin time may bring    If in thy temple thou wilt let me kneel.     Alas, alas, thou wilt not tarry here,       But, like that bird, the servant of the sun,          Who flies before the north wind and the night,       So wilt thou fly our evil land and drear,    Back to the tower of thine old delight,          And the red lips of young Euphorion;    Nor shall I ever see thy face again,       But in this poisonous garden-close must stay,       Crowning my brows with the thorn-crown of pain,    Till all my loveless life shall pass away.     O Helen!  Helen! Helen! yet a while,       Yet for a little while, O, tarry here,          Till the dawn cometh and the shadows flee!       For in the gladsome sunlight of thy smile    Of heaven or hell I have no thought or fear,          Seeing I know no other god but thee:    No other god save him, before whose feet       In nets of gold the tired planets move,       The incarnate spirit of spiritual love    Who in thy body holds his joyous seat.     Thou wert not born as common women are!       But, girt with silver splendour of the foam,          Didst from the depths of sapphire seas arise!       And at thy coming some immortal star,    Bearded with flame, blazed in the Eastern skies,          And waked the shepherds on thine island-home.    Thou shalt not die: no asps of Egypt creep       Close at thy heels to taint the delicate air;       No sullen-blooming poppies stain thy hair,    Those scarlet heralds of eternal sleep.     Lily of love, pure and inviolate!       Tower of ivory! red rose of fire!          Thou hast come down our darkness to illume:    For we, close-caught in the wide nets of Fate,       Wearied with waiting for the World's Desire,          Aimlessly wandered in the House of gloom,    Aimlessly sought some slumberous anodyne       For wasted lives, for lingering wretchedness,    Till we beheld thy re-arisen shrine,       And the white glory of thy loveliness.    THE BURDEN OF ITYS      THIS English Thames is holier far than Rome,       Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea    Breaking across the woodland, with the foam       Of meadow-sweet and white anemone    To fleck their blue waves,?God is likelier there    Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear!     Those violet-gleaming butterflies that take       Yon creamy lily for their pavilion    Are monsignores, and where the rushes shake       A lazy pike lies basking in the sun,    His eyes half shut,?he is some mitred old    Bishop in _partibus_! look at those gaudy scales all green and gold.     The wind the restless prisoner of the trees       Does well for Pal'strina, one would say    The mighty master's hands were on the keys       Of the Maria organ, which they play    When early on some sapphire Easter morn    In a high litter red as blood or sin the Pope is borne     From his dark House out to the Balcony       Above the bronze gates and the crowded square,    Whose very fountains seem for ecstasy       To toss their silver lances in the air,    And stretching out weak hands to East and West    In vain sends peace to peaceless lands, to restless nations rest.     Is not yon lingering orange after-glow       That stays to vex the moon more fair than all    Rome's lordliest pageants! strange, a year ago       I knelt before some crimson Cardinal    Who bare the Host across the Esquiline,    And now?those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine.     The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous       With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring    Through this cool evening than the odorous       Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,    When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,    And makes God's body from the common fruit of corn and vine.     Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the mass       Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird    Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass       I see that throbbing throat which once I heard    On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,    Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.     Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves       At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,    And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves       Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe    To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait    Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate.     And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,       And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,    And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees       That round and round the linden blossoms play;    And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,    And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall,     And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring       While the last violet loiters by the well,    And sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing       The song of Linus through a sunny dell    Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold    And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold.     And sweet with young Lycoris to recline       In some Illyrian valley far away,    Where canopied on herbs amaracine       We too might waste the summer-tranc?d day    Matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,    While far beneath us frets the troubled purple of the sea.     But sweeter far if silver-sandalled foot       Of some long-hidden God should ever tread    The Nuneham meadows, if with reeded flute       Pressed to his lips some Faun might raise his head    By the green water-flags, ah! sweet indeed    To see the heavenly herdsman call his white-fleeced flock to feed.     Then sing to me thou tuneful chorister,       Though what thou sing'st be thine own requiem!    Tell me thy tale thou hapless chronicler       Of thine own tragedies! do not contemn    These unfamiliar haunts, this English field,    For many a lovely coronal our northern isle can yield     Which Grecian meadows know not, many a rose       Which all day long in vales ?olian    A lad might seek in vain for over-grows       Our hedges like a wanton courtesan    Unthrifty of its beauty; lilies too    Ilissos never mirrored star our streams, and cockles blue     Dot the green wheat which, though they are the signs       For swallows going south, would never spread    Their azure tents between the Attic vines;       Even that little weed of ragged red,    Which |2
71|bids the robin pipe, in Arcady    Would be a trespasser, and many an unsung elegy     Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding Thames       Which to awake were sweeter ravishment    Than ever Syrinx wept for; diadems       Of brown bee-studded orchids which were meant    For Cyther?a's brows are hidden here    Unknown to Cyther?a, and by yonder pasturing steer     There is a tiny yellow daffodil,       The butterfly can see it from afar,    Although one summer evening's dew could fill       Its little cup twice over ere the star    Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold    And be no prodigal; each leaf is flecked with spotted gold     As if Jove's gorgeous leman Danae       Hot from his gilded arms had stooped to kiss    The trembling petals, or young Mercury       Low-flying to the dusky ford of Dis    Had with one feather of his pinions    Just brushed them! the slight stem which bears the burden of its suns     Is hardly thicker than the gossamer,       Or poor Arachne's silver tapestry,?    Men say it bloomed upon the sepulchre       Of One I sometime worshipped, but to me    It seems to bring diviner memories    Of faun-loved Heliconian glades and blue nymph-haunted seas,     Of an untrodden vale at Tempe where       On the clear river's marge Narcissus lies,    The tangle of the forest in his hair,       The silence of the woodland in his eyes,    Wooing that drifting imagery which is    No sooner kissed than broken; memories of Salmacis     Who is not boy nor girl and yet is both,       Fed by two fires and unsatisfied    Through their excess, each passion being loth       For love's own sake to leave the other's side    Yet killing love by staying; memories    Of Oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moonlit trees,     Of lonely Ariadne on the wharf       At Naxos, when she saw the treacherous crew    Far out at sea, and waved her crimson scarf       And called false Theseus back again nor knew    That Dionysos on an amber pard    Was close behind her; memories of what M?onia's bard     With sightless eyes beheld, the wall of Troy,       Queen Helen lying in the ivory room,    And at her side an amorous red-lipped boy       Trimming with dainty hand his helmet's plume,    And far away the moil, the shout, the groan,    As Hector shielded off the spear and Ajax hurled the stone;     Of wing?d Perseus with his flawless sword       Cleaving the snaky tresses of the witch,    And all those tales imperishably stored       In little Grecian urns, freightage more rich    Than any gaudy galleon of Spain    Bare from the Indies ever! these at least bring back again,     For well I know they are not dead at all,       The ancient Gods of Grecian poesy:    They are asleep, and when they hear thee call       Will wake and think ?t is very Thessaly,    This Thames the Daulian waters, this cool glade    The yellow-irised mead where once young Itys laughed and played.     If it was thou dear jasmine-cradled bird       Who from the leafy stillness of thy throne    Sang to the wondrous boy, until he heard       The horn of Atalanta faintly blown    Across the Cumnor hills, and wandering    Through Bagley wood at evening found the Attic poets? spring,?     Ah! tiny sober-suited advocate       That pleadest for the moon against the day!    If thou didst make the shepherd seek his mate       On that sweet questing, when Proserpina    Forgot it was not Sicily and leant    Across the mossy Sandford stile in ravished wonderment,?     Light-winged and bright-eyed miracle of the wood!       If ever thou didst soothe with melody    One of that little clan, that brotherhood       Which loved the morning-star of Tuscany    More than the perfect sun of Raphael    And is immortal, sing to me! for I too love thee well.     Sing on! sing on! let the dull world grow young,       Let elemental things take form again,    And the old shapes of Beauty walk among       The simple garths and open crofts, as when    The son of Leto bare the willow rod,    And the soft sheep and shaggy goats followed the boyish God.     Sing on! sing on! and Bacchus will be here       Astride upon his gorgeous Indian throne,    And over whimpering tigers shake the spear       With yellow ivy crowned and gummy cone,    While at his side the wanton Bassarid    Will throw the lion by the mane and catch the mountain kid!     Sing on! and I will wear the leopard skin,       And steal the moon?d wings of Ashtaroth,    Upon whose icy chariot we could win       Cith?ron in an hour ere the froth    Has over-brimmed the wine-vat or the Faun    Ceased from the treading! ay, before the flickering lamp of dawn     Has scared the hooting owlet to its nest,       And warned the bat to close its filmy vans,    Some M?nad girl with vine-leaves on her breast       Will filch their beech-nuts from the sleeping Pans    So softly that the little nested thrush    Will never wake, and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush     Down the green valley where the fallen dew       Lies thick beneath the elm and count her store,    Till the brown Satyrs in a jolly crew       Trample the loosestrife down along the shore,    And where their horn?d master sits in state    Bring strawberries and bloomy plums upon a wicker crate!     Sing on! and soon with passion-wearied face       Through the cool leaves Apollo's lad will come,    The Tyrian prince his bristled boar will chase       Adown the chestnut-copses all a-bloom,    And ivory-limbed, grey-eyed, with look of pride,    After yon velvet-coated deer the virgin maid will ride.     Sing on! and I the dying boy will see       Stain with his purple blood the waxen bell    That overweighs the jacinth, and to me       The wretched Cyprian her woe will tell,    And I will kiss her mouth and streaming eyes,    And lead her to the myrtle-hidden grove where Adon lies!     Cry out aloud on Itys! memory       That foster-brother of remorse and pain    Drops poison in mine ear,?O to be free,       To burn one's old ships! and to launch again    Into the white-plumed battle of the waves    And fight old Proteus for the spoil of coral-flowered caves!     O for Medea with her poppied spell!       O for the secret of the Colchian shrine!    O for one leaf of that pale asphodel       Which binds the tired brows of Proserpine,    And sheds such wondrous dews at eve that she    Dreams of the fields of Enna, by the far Sicilian sea,     Where oft the golden-girdled bee she chased       From lily to lily on the level mead,    Ere yet her sombre Lord had bid her taste       The deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed,    Ere the black steeds had harried her away    Down to the faint and flowerless land, the sick and sunless day.     O for one midnight and as paramour       The Venus of the little Melian farm!    O that some antique statue for one hour       Might wake to passion, and that I could charm    The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair,    Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair!     Sing on! sing on!  I would be drunk with life,       Drunk with the trampled vintage of my youth,    I would forget the wearying wasted strife,       The riven veil, the Gorgon eyes of Truth,    The prayerless vigil and the cry for prayer,    The barren gifts, the lifted arms, the dull insensate air!     Sing on! sing on!  O feathered Niobe,       Thou canst make sorrow beautiful, and steal    From joy its sweetest music, not as we       Who by dead voiceless silence strive to heal    Our too untented wounds, and do but keep    Pain barricadoed in our hearts, and murder pillowed sleep.     Sing louder yet, why must I still behold       The wan white face of that deserted Christ,    Whose bleeding hands my hands did once enfold,       Whose smitten lips my lips so oft have kissed,    And now in mute and marble misery    Sits in his lone dishonoured House and weeps, perchance for me?     O Memory cast down thy wreath?d shell!       Break thy hoarse lute O sad Melpomene!    O Sorrow, Sorrow keep thy cloistered cell       Nor dim with tears this limpid Castaly!    Cease, Philomel, thou dost the forest wrong    To vex its sylvan quiet with such wild impassioned song!     Cease, cease, or if ?t is anguish to be dumb       Take from the pastoral thrush her simpler air,    Whose jocund carelessness doth more become       This English woodland than thy keen despair,    Ah! cease and let the north wind bear thy lay    Back to the rocky hills of Thrace, the stormy Daulian bay.     A moment more, the startled leaves had stirred,       Endymion would have passed across the mead    Moonstruck with love, and this still Thames had heard       Pan plash and paddle groping for some reed    To lure from her blue cave that Naiad maid    Who for such piping listens half in joy and half afraid.     A moment more, the waking dove had cooed,       The silver daughter of the silver sea    With the fond gyves of clinging hands had wooed       Her wanton from the chase, and Dryope    Had thrust aside the branches of her oak    To see the lusty gold-haired lad rein in his snorting yoke.     A moment more, the trees had stooped to kiss       Pale Daphne just awakening from the swoon    Of tremulous laurels, lonely Salmacis       Had bared his barren beauty to the moon,    And through the vale with sad voluptuous smile    Antinous had wandered, the red lotus of the Nile     Down leaning from his black and clustering hair,       To shade those slumberous eyelids? caverned bliss,    Or else on yonder grassy slope with bare       High-tuniced limbs unravished Artemis    Had bade her hounds give tongue, and roused the deer    From his green ambuscade with shrill halloo and pricking spear.     Lie still, lie still, O passionate heart, lie still!       O Melancholy, fold thy raven wing!    O sobbing Dryad, from thy hollow hill       Come not with such despondent answering!    No more thou wing?d Marsyas complain,    Apollo loveth not to hear such troubled songs of pain!     It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,       No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,    The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,       And from the copse left desolate and bare    Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,    Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody     So sad, that one might think a human heart       Brake in each separate note, a quality    Which music sometimes has, being the Art       Which is most nigh to tears and memory;    Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?    Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,     Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,       No woven web of bloody heraldries,    But mossy dells for roving comrades made,       Warm valleys where the tired student lies    With half-shut book, and many a winding walk    Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.     The harmless rabbit gambols with its young       Across the trampled towing-path, where late    A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng       Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;    The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,    Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds     Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out       Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock    Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout       Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,    And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,    And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.     The heron passes homeward to the mere,       The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,    Gold world by world the silent stars appear,       And like a blossom blown before the breeze    A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,    Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.     She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,       She knows Endymion is not far away;    ?Tis I, ?tis I, whose soul is as the reed       Which has no message of its own to play,    So pipes another's bidding, it is I,    Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.     Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite trill       About the sombre woodland seems to cling    Dying in music, else the air is still,       So still that one might hear the bat's small wing    Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell    Each tiny dew-drop dripping from the bluebell's brimming cell.     And far away across the lengthening wold,       Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,    Magdalen's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold       Marks the long High Street of the little town,    And warns me to return; I must not wait,    Hark! ?t is the curfew booming from the bell at Christ Church gate.    WIND FLOWERS   IMPRESSION DU MATIN      THE Thames nocturne of blue and gold       Changed to a Harmony in grey:       A barge with ochre-coloured hay    Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold     The yellow fog came creeping down       The bridges, till the houses? walls       Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul's    Loomed like a bubble o?er the town.     Then suddenly arose the clang       Of waking life; the streets were stirred       With country waggons: and a bird    Flew to the glistening roofs and sang.     But one pale woman all alone,       The daylight kissing her wan hair,       Loitered beneath the gas lamps? flare,    With lips of flame and heart of stone.   MAGDALEN WALKS      THE little white clouds are racing over the sky,       And the fields are strewn with the gold of the flower of March,       The daffodil breaks under foot, and the tasselled larch    Sways and swings as the thrush goes hurrying by.     A delicate odour is borne on the wings of the morning breeze,       The odour of deep wet grass, and of brown new-furrowed earth,       The birds are singing for joy of the Spring's glad birth,    Hopping from branch to branch on the rocking trees.     And all the woods are alive with the murmur and sound of Spring,       And the rose-bud breaks into pink on the climbing briar,       And the crocus-bed is a quivering moon of fire    Girdled round with the belt of an amethyst ring.     And the plane to the pine-tree is whispering some tale of love       Till it rustles with laughter and tosses its mantle of green,       And the gloom of the wych-elm's hollow is lit with the iris sheen    Of the burnished rainbow throat and the silver breast of a dove.     See! the lark starts up from his bed in the meadow there,       Breaking the gossamer threads and the nets of dew,       And flashing adown the river, a flame of blue!    The kingfisher flies like an arrow, and wounds the air.   ATHANASIA      TO that gaunt House of Art which lacks for naught       Of all the great things men have saved from Time,    The withered body of a girl was brought       Dead ere the world's glad youth had touched its prime,    And seen by lonely Arabs lying hid    In the dim womb of some black pyramid.     But when they had unloosed the linen band       Which swathed the Egyptian's body,?lo! was found    Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand       A little seed, which sown in English ground    Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear    And spread rich odours through our spring-tide air.     With such strange arts this flower did allure       That all forgotten was the asphodel,    And the brown bee, the lily's paramour,       Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell,    For not a thing of earth it seemed to be,    But stolen from some heavenly Arcady.     In vain the sad narcissus, wan and white       At its own beauty, hung across the stream,    The purple dragon-fly had no delight       With its gold dust to make his wings a-gleam,    Ah! no delight the jasmine-bloom to kiss,    Or brush the rain-pearls from the eucharis.     For love of it the passionate nightingale       Forgot the hills of Thrace, the cruel king,    And the pale dove no longer cared to sail       Through the wet woods at time of blossoming,    But round this flower of Egypt sought to float,    With silvered wing and amethystine throat.     While the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue       A cooling wind crept from the land of snows,    And the warm south with tender tears of dew       Drenched its white leaves when Hesperos up-rose    Amid those sea-green meadows of the sky    On which the scarlet bars of sunset lie.     But when o?er wastes of lily-haunted field       The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune,    And broad and glittering like an argent shield       High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon,    Did no strange dream or evil memory make    Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake?     Ah no! to this bright flower a thousand years       Seemed but the lingering of a summer's day,    It never knew the tide of cankering fears       Which turn a boy's gold hair to withered grey,    The dread desire of death it never knew,    Or how all folk that they were born must rue.     For we to death with pipe and dancing go,       Nor would we pass the ivory gate again,    As some sad river wearied of its flow       Through the dull plains, the haunts of common men,    Leaps lover-like into the terrible sea!    And counts it gain to die so gloriously.     We mar our lordly strength in barren strife       With the world's legions led by clamorous care,    It never feels decay but gathers life       From the pure sunlight and the supreme air,    We live beneath Time's wasting sovereignty,    It is the child of all eternity.   SERENADE                                  (FOR MUSIC)     THE western wind is blowing fair       Across the dark ?gean sea,    And at the secret marble stair       My Tyrian galley waits for thee.    Come down! the purple sail is spread,       The watchman sleeps within the town,    O leave thy lily-flowered bed,       O Lady mine come down, come down!     She will not come, I know her well,       Of lover's vows she hath no care,    And little good a man can tell       Of one so cruel and so fair.    True love is but a woman's toy,       They never know the lover's pain,    And I who loved as loves a boy       Must love in vain, must love in vain.     O noble pilot, tell me true,       Is that the sheen of golden hair?    Or is it but the tangled dew       That binds the passion-flowers there?    Good sailor come and tell me now       Is that my Lady's lily hand?    Or is it but the gleaming prow,       Or is it but the silver sand?     No! no! ?tis not the tangled dew,       ?Tis not the silver-fretted sand,    It is my own dear Lady true       With golden hair and lily hand!    O noble pilot, steer for Troy,       Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,    This is the Queen of life and joy       Whom we must bear from Grecian shore!     The waning sky grows faint and blue,       It wants an hour still of day,    Aboard! aboard! my gallant crew,       O Lady mine, away! away!    O noble pilot, steer for Troy,       Good sailor, ply the labouring oar,    O loved as only loves a boy!       O loved for ever evermore!   ENDYMION                                  (FOR MUSIC)     THE apple trees are hung with gold,       And birds are loud in Arcady,    The sheep lie bleating in the fold,    The wild goat runs across the wold,    But yesterday his love he told,       I know he will come back to me.    O rising moon!  O Lady moon!       Be you my lover's sentinel,       You cannot choose but know him well,    For he is shod with purple shoon,    You cannot choose but know my love,       For he a shepherd's crook doth bear,    And he is soft as any dove,       And brown and curly is his hair.     The turtle now has ceased to call       Upon her crimson-footed groom,    The grey wolf prowls about the stall,    The lily's singing seneschal    Sleeps in the lily-bell, and all       The violet hills are lost in gloom.    O risen moon!  O holy moon!       Stand on the top of Helice,       And if my own true love you see,    Ah! if you see the purple shoon,    The hazel crook, the lad's brown hair,       The goat-skin wrapped about his arm,    Tell him that I am waiting where       The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.     The falling dew is cold and chill,       And no bird sings in Arcady,    The little fauns have left the hill,    Even the tired daffodil    Has closed its gilded doors, and still       My lover comes not back to me.    False moon!  False moon!  O waning moon!       Where is my own true lover gone,       Where are the lips vermilion,    The shepherd's crook, the purple shoon?    Why spread that silver pavilion,       Why wear that veil of drifting mist?    Ah! thou hast young Endymion,       Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!   LA BELLA DONNA DELLA MIA MENTE      MY limbs are wasted with a flame,       My feet are sore with travelling,    For, calling on my Lady's name,       My lips have now forgot to sing.     O Linnet in the wild-rose brake       Strain for my Love thy melody,    O Lark sing louder for love's sake,       My gentle Lady passeth by.     She is too fair for any man       To see or hold his heart's delight,    Fairer than Queen or courtesan       Or moonlit water in the night.     Her hair is bound with myrtle leaves,       (Green leaves upon her golden hair!)    Green grasses through the yellow sheaves       Of autumn corn are not more fair.     Her little lips, more made to kiss       Than to cry bitterly for pain,    Are tremulous as brook-water is,       Or roses after evening rain.     Her neck is like white melilote       Flushing for pleasure of the sun,    The throbbing of the linnet's throat       Is not so sweet to look upon.     As a pomegranate, cut in twain,       White-seeded, is her crimson mouth,    Her cheeks are as the fading stain       Where the peach reddens to the south.     O twining hands!  O delicate       White body made for love and pain!    O House of love!  O desolate       Pale flower beaten by the rain!   CHANSON      A RING of gold and a milk-white dove       Are goodly gifts for thee,    And a hempen rope for your own love       To hang upon a tree.     For you a House of Ivory,       (Roses are white in the rose-bower)!    A narrow bed for me to lie,       (White, O white, is the hemlock flower)!     Myrtle and jessamine for you,       (O the red rose is fair to see)!    For me the cypress and the rue,       (Finest of all is rosemary)!     For you three lovers of your hand,       (Green grass where a man lies dead)!    For me three paces on the sand,       (Plant lilies at my head)!    CHARMIDES                                        I.     HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home       With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily    Stood at his galley's prow, and let the foam       Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,    And holding wave and wind in boy's despite    Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.     Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear       Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,    And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,       And bade the pilot head her lustily    Against the nor?west gale, and all day long    Held on his way, and marked the rowers? time with measured song.     And when the faint Corinthian hills were red       Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,    And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,       And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,    And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold    Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,     And a rich robe stained with the fishers? juice       Which of some swarthy trader he had bought    Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,       And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,    And by the questioning merchants made his way    Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day     Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,       Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet    Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd       Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat    Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring    The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling     The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang       His studded crook against the temple wall    To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang       Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;    And then the clear-voiced maidens ?gan to sing,    And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,     A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,       A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery    Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb       Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee    Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil    Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked spoil     Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid       To please Athena, and the dappled hide    Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade       Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,    And from the pillared precinct one by one    Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had    done.     And the old priest put out the waning fires       Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed    For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres       Came fainter on the wind, as down the road    In joyous dance these country folk did pass,    And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.     Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,       And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,    And the rose-petals falling from the wreath       As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,    And seemed to be in some entranc?d swoon    Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon     Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,       When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,    And flinging wide the cedar-carven door       Beheld an awful image saffron-clad    And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared    From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared     Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled       The Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,    And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,       And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold    In passion impotent, while with blind gaze    The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.     The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp       Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast    The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp       Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast    Divide the folded curtains of the night,    And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.     And guilty lovers in their venery       Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,    Deeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;       And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats    Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,    Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.     For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,       And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,    And the air quaked with dissonant alarums       Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,    And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,    And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.     Ready for death with parted lips he stood,       And well content at such a price to see    That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,       The marvel of that pitiless chastity,    Ah! well content indeed, for never wight    Since Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.     Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air       Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,    And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,       And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;    For whom would not such love make desperate?    And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate     Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,       And bared the breasts of polished ivory,    Till from the waist the peplos falling down       Left visible the secret mystery    Which to no lover will Athena show,    The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.     Those who have never known a lover's sin       Let them not read my ditty, it will be    To their dull ears so musicless and thin       That they will have no joy of it, but ye    To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,    Ye who have learned who Eros is,?O listen yet awhile.     A little space he let his greedy eyes       Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight    Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,       And then hi|2
72|s lips in hungering delight    Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck    He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.     Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,       For all night long he murmured honeyed word,    And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed       Her pale and argent body undisturbed,    And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed    His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.     It was as if Numidian javelins       Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,    And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins       In exquisite pulsation, and the pain    Was such sweet anguish that he never drew    His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.     They who have never seen the daylight peer       Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,    And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear       And worshipped body risen, they for certain    Will never know of what I try to sing,    How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.     The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,       The sign which shipmen say is ominous    Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,       And the low lightening east was tremulous    With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,    Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.     Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast       Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,    And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,       And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran    Like a young fawn unto an olive wood    Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;     And sought a little stream, which well he knew,       For oftentimes with boyish careless shout    The green and crested grebe he would pursue,       Or snare in woven net the silver trout,    And down amid the startled reeds he lay    Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.     On the green bank he lay, and let one hand       Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,    And soon the breath of morning came and fanned       His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly    The tangled curls from off his forehead, while    He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.     And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak       With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,    And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke       Curled through the air across the ripening oats,    And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed    As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.     And when the light-foot mower went afield       Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,    And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,       And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,    Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream    And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,     Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,       ?It is young Hylas, that false runaway    Who with a Naiad now would make his bed       Forgetting Herakles,? but others, ?Nay,    It is Narcissus, his own paramour,    Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.?     And when they nearer came a third one cried,       ?It is young Dionysos who has hid    His spear and fawnskin by the river side       Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,    And wise indeed were we away to fly:    They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.?     So turned they back, and feared to look behind,       And told the timid swain how they had seen    Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,       And no man dared to cross the open green,    And on that day no olive-tree was slain,    Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,     Save when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail       Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound    Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,       Hoping that he some comrade new had found,    And gat no answer, and then half afraid    Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade     A little girl ran laughing from the farm,       Not thinking of love's secret mysteries,    And when she saw the white and gleaming arm       And all his manlihood, with longing eyes    Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity    Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.     Far off he heard the city's hum and noise,       And now and then the shriller laughter where    The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys       Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,    And now and then a little tinkling bell    As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.     Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,       The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,    In sleek and oily coat the water-rat       Breasting the little ripples manfully    Made for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough    Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.     On the faint wind floated the silky seeds       As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,    The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds       And flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,    Which scarce had caught again its imagery    Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.     But little care had he for any thing       Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,    And from the copse the linnet ?gan to sing       To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;    Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen    The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.     But when the herdsman called his straggling goats       With whistling pipe across the rocky road,    And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes       Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode    Of coming storm, and the belated crane    Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain     Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,       And from the gloomy forest went his way    Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,       And came at last unto a little quay,    And called his mates aboard, and took his seat    On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping sheet,     And steered across the bay, and when nine suns       Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,    And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons       To the chaste stars their confessors, or told    Their dearest secret to the downy moth    That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth     Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes       And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked    As though the lading of three argosies       Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,    And darkness straightway stole across the deep,    Sheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,     And the moon hid behind a tawny mask       Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge    Rose the red plume, the huge and horn?d casque,       The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!    And clad in bright and burnished panoply    Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!     To the dull sailors? sight her loosened looks       Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet    Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,       And, marking how the rising waters beat    Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried    To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side     But he, the overbold adulterer,       A dear profaner of great mysteries,    An ardent amorous idolater,       When he beheld those grand relentless eyes    Laughed loud for joy, and crying out ?I come?    Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.     Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,       One dancer left the circling galaxy,    And back to Athens on her clattering car       In all the pride of venged divinity    Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,    And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.     And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew       With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,    And the old pilot bade the trembling crew       Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen    Close to the stern a dim and giant form,    And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.     And no man dared to speak of Charmides       Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,    And when they reached the strait Symplegades       They beached their galley on the shore, and sought    The toll-gate of the city hastily,    And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.                                       II.     BUT some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare       The boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,    And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair       And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;    Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,    And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.     And when he neared his old Athenian home,       A mighty billow rose up suddenly    Upon whose oily back the clotted foam       Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,    And clasping him unto its glassy breast    Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!     Now where Colonos leans unto the sea       There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;    The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee       For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun    Is not afraid, for never through the day    Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.     But often from the thorny labyrinth       And tangled branches of the circling wood    The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth       Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood    Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,    Nor dares to wind his horn, or?else at the first break of day     The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball       Along the reedy shore, and circumvent    Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal       For fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,    And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,    Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.     On this side and on that a rocky cave,       Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands    Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave       Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,    As though it feared to be too soon forgot    By the green rush, its playfellow,?and yet, it is a spot     So small, that the inconstant butterfly       Could steal the hoarded money from each flower    Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy       Its over-greedy love,?within an hour    A sailor boy, were he but rude enow    To land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,     Would almost leave the little meadow bare,       For it knows nothing of great pageantry,    Only a few narcissi here and there       Stand separate in sweet austerity,    Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,    And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.     Hither the billow brought him, and was glad       Of such dear servitude, and where the land    Was virgin of all waters laid the lad       Upon the golden margent of the strand,    And like a lingering lover oft returned    To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,     Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,       That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,    Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost       Had withered up those lilies white and red    Which, while the boy would through the forest range,    Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.     And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,       Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied    The boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,       And feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,    And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade    Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.     Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be       So dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms    Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,       And longed to listen to those subtle charms    Insidious lovers weave when they would win    Some fenc?d fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin     To yield her treasure unto one so fair,       And lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,    Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,       And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth    Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid    Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,     Returned to fresh assault, and all day long       Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,    And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,       Then frowned to see how froward was the boy    Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,    Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;     Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,       But said, ?He will awake, I know him well,    He will awake at evening when the sun       Hangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel;    This sleep is but a cruel treachery    To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea     Deeper than ever falls the fisher's line       Already a huge Triton blows his horn,    And weaves a garland from the crystalline       And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn    The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,    For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crown?d head,     We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,       And a blue wave will be our canopy,    And at our feet the water-snakes will curl       In all their amethystine panoply    Of diamonded mail, and we will mark    The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,     Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold       Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep    His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,       And we will see the painted dolphins sleep    Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks    Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.     And tremulous opal-hued anemones       Will wave their purple fringes where we tread    Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies       Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread    The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,    And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.?     But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun       With gaudy pennon flying passed away    Into his brazen House, and one by one       The little yellow stars began to stray    Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed    She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,     And cried, ?Awake, already the pale moon       Washes the trees with silver, and the wave    Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,       The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave    The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,    And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass.     Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,       For in yon stream there is a little reed    That often whispers how a lovely boy       Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,    Who when his cruel pleasure he had done    Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.     Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still       With great Apollo's kisses, and the fir    Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill       Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher    Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen    The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.     Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,       And every morn a young and ruddy swain    Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,       And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain    By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;    But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove     With little crimson feet, which with its store       Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad    Had stolen from the lofty sycamore       At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had    Flown off in search of berried juniper    Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager     Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency       So constant as this simple shepherd-boy    For my poor lips, his joyous purity       And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy    A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;    For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;     His argent forehead, like a rising moon       Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,    Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon       Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse    For Cyther?a, the first silky down    Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and brown;     And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds       Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,    And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds       Is in his homestead for the thievish fly    To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead    Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.     And yet I love him not; it was for thee       I kept my love; I knew that thou would'st come    To rid me of this pallid chastity,       Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam    Of all the wide ?gean, brightest star    Of ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!     I knew that thou would'st come, for when at first       The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring    Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst       To myriad multitudinous blossoming    Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons    That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes? rapturous tunes     Startled the squirrel from its granary,       And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,    Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy       Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein    Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,    And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.     The trooping fawns at evening came and laid       Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,    And on my topmost branch the blackbird made       A little nest of grasses for his spouse,    And now and then a twittering wren would light    On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.     I was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,       Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,    And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase       The timorous girl, till tired out with play    She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,    And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.     Then come away unto my ambuscade       Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy    For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade       Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify    The dearest rites of love; there in the cool    And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,     The ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,       For round its rim great creamy lilies float    Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,       Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat    Steered by a dragon-fly,?be not afraid    To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made     For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,       One arm around her boyish paramour,    Strays often there at eve, and I have seen       The moon strip off her misty vestiture    For young Endymion's eyes; be not afraid,    The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.     Nay if thou will'st, back to the beating brine,       Back to the boisterous billow let us go,    And walk all day beneath the hyaline       Huge vault of Neptune's watery portico,    And watch the purple monsters of the deep    Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.     For if my mistress find me lying here       She will not ruth or gentle pity show,    But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere       Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,    And draw the feathered notch against her breast,    And loose the arch?d cord; aye, even now upon the quest     I hear her hurrying feet,?awake, awake,       Thou laggard in love's battle! once at least    Let me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake       My parch?d being with the nectarous feast    Which even gods affect!  O come, Love, come,    Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.?     Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees       Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air    Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas       Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare    Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,    And like a flame a barb?d reed flew whizzing down the glade.     And where the little flowers of her breast       Just brake into their milky blossoming,    This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,       Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,    And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,    And dug a long red road, and cleft with wing?d death her heart.     Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry       On the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,    Sobbing for incomplete virginity,       And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,    And all the pain of things unsatisfied,    And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side.     Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,       And very pitiful to see her die    Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known       The joy of passion, that dread mystery    Which not to know is not to live at all,    And yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.     But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,       Who with Adonis all night long had lain    Within some shepherd's hut in Arcady,       On team of silver doves and gilded wain    Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar    From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,     And when low down she spied the hapless pair,       And heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,    Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air       As though it were a viol, hastily    She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,    And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous    doom.     For as a gardener turning back his head       To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows    With careless scythe too near some flower bed,       And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,    And with the flower's loosened loneliness    Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness     Driving his little flock along the mead       Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide    Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede       And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,    Treads down their brimming golden chalices    Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;     Or as a schoolboy tired of his book       Flings himself down upon the reedy grass    And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,       And for a time forgets the hour glass,    Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,    And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.     And Venus cried, ?It is dread Artemis       Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,    Or else that mightier maid whose care it is       To guard her strong and stainless majesty    Upon the hill Athenian,?alas!    That they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should pass.?     So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl       In the great golden waggon tenderly    (Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl       Just threaded with a blue vein's tapestry    Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast    Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)     And then each pigeon spread its milky van,       The bright car soared into the dawning sky,    And like a cloud the aerial caravan       Passed over the ?gean silently,    Till the faint air was troubled with the song    From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.     But when the doves had reached their wonted goal       Where the wide stair of orb?d marble dips    Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul       Just shook the trembling petals of her lips    And passed into the void, and Venus knew    That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,     And bade her servants carve a cedar chest       With all the wonder of this history,    Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest       Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky    On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun    Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.     Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere       The morning bee had stung the daffodil    With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair       The waking stag had leapt across the rill    And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept    Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.     And when day brake, within that silver shrine       Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,    Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine       That she whose beauty made Death amorous    Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,    And let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.                                       III     IN melancholy moonless Acheron,       Farm for the goodly earth and joyous day    Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun       Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May    Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,    Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,     There by a dim and dark Leth?an well       Young Charmides was lying; wearily    He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,       And with its little rifled treasury    Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,    And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,     When as he gazed into the watery glass       And through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned    His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass       Across the mirror, and a little hand    Stole into his, and warm lips timidly    Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.     Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,       And ever nigher still their faces came,    And nigher ever did their young mouths draw       Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,    And longing arms around her neck he cast,    And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,     And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,       And all her maidenhood was his to slay,    And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss       Their passion waxed and waned,?O why essay    To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!    Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.     Too venturous poesy, O why essay       To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings    O?er daring Icarus and bid thy lay       Sleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings    Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,    Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quid!     Enough, enough that he whose life had been       A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,    Could in the loveless land of Hades glean       One scorching harvest from those fields of flame    Where passion walks with naked unshod feet    And is not wounded,?ah! enough that once their lips could meet     In that wild throb when all existences       Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy    Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress       Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone    Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne    Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.    FLOWERS OF GOLD   IMPRESSIONS  I LES SILHOUETTES         THE sea is flecked with bars of grey,       The dull dead wind is out of tune,       And like a withered leaf the moon    Is blown across the stormy bay.        Etched clear upon the pallid sand       Lies the black boat: a sailor boy       Clambers aboard in careless joy    With laughing face and gleaming hand.        And overhead the curlews cry,       Where through the dusky upland grass       The young brown-throated reapers pass,    Like silhouettes against the sky.   II LA FUITE DE LA LUNE         TO outer senses there is peace,       A dreamy peace on either hand       Deep silence in the shadowy land,    Deep silence where the shadows cease.        Save for a cry that echoes shrill       From some lone bird disconsolate;       A corncrake calling to its mate;    The answer from the misty hill.        And suddenly the moon withdraws       Her sickle from the lightening skies,       And to her sombre cavern flies,    Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.

No cypress shades his grave, no funeral yew,       But gentle violets weeping with the dew    Weave on his bones an ever-blossoming chain.    O proudest heart that broke for misery!       O sweetest lips since those of Mitylene!       O poet-painter of our English Land!    Thy name was writ in water?it shall stand:       And tears like mine will keep thy memory green,       As Isabella did her Basil-tree.  ROME.   THEOCRITUS                                  A VILLANELLE     O SINGER of Persephone!       In the dim meadows desolate    Dost thou remember Sicily?     Still through the ivy flits the bee       Where Amaryllis lies in state;    O Singer of Persephone!     Sim?tha calls on Hecate       And hears the wild dogs at the gate;    Dost thou remember Sicily?     Still by the light and laughing sea       Poor Polypheme bemoans his fate;    O Singer of Persephone!     And still in boyish rivalry       Young Daphnis challenges his mate;    Dost thou remember Sicily?     Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,       For thee the jocund shepherds wait;    O Singer of Persephone!    Dost thou remember Sicily?   IN THE GOLD ROOM                                   A HARMONY     HER ivory hands on the ivory keys       Strayed in a fitful fantasy,    Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees       Rustle their pale-leaves listlessly,    Or the drifting foam of a restless sea    When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze.     Her gold hair fell on the wall of gold       Like the delicate gossamer tangles spun    On the burnished disk of the marigold,       Or the sunflower turning to meet the sun       When the gloom of the dark blue night is done,    And the spear of the lily is aureoled.     And her sweet red lips on these lips of mine       Burned like the ruby fire set    In the swinging lamp of a crimson shrine,       Or the bleeding wounds of the pomegranate,       Or the heart of the lotus drenched and wet    With the spilt-out blood of the rose-red wine.   BALLADE DE MARGUERITE                                   (NORMANDE)     I AM weary of lying within the chase    When the knights are meeting in market-place.     Nay, go not thou to the red-roofed town    Lest the hoofs of the war-horse tread thee down.     But I would not go where the Squires ride,    I would only walk by my Lady's side.     Alack! and alack! thou art overbold,    A Forester's son may not eat off gold.     Will she love me the less that my Father is seen    Each Martinmas day in a doublet green?     Perchance she is sewing at tapestrie,    Spindle and loom are not meet for thee.     Ah, if she is working the arras bright    I might ravel the threads by the fire-light.     Perchance she is hunting of the deer,    How could you follow o?er hill and mere?     Ah, if she is riding with the court,    I might run beside her and wind the morte.     Perchance she is kneeling in St. Denys,    (On her soul may our Lady have gramercy!)     Ah, if she is praying in lone chapelle,    I might swing the censer and ring the bell.     Come in, my son, for you look sae pale,    The father shall fill thee a stoup of ale.     But who are these knights in bright array?    Is it a pageant the rich folks play?     ?T is the King of England from over sea,    Who has come unto visit our fair countrie.     But why does the curfew toll sae low?    And why do the mourners walk a-row?     O ?t is Hugh of Amiens my sister's son    Who is lying stark, for his day is done.     Nay, nay, for I see white lilies clear,    It is no strong man who lies on the bier.     O ?t is old Dame Jeannette that kept the hall,    I knew she would die at the autumn fall.     Dame Jeannette had not that gold-brown hair,    Old Jeannette was not a maiden fair.     O ?t is none of our kith and none of our kin,    (Her soul may our Lady assoil from sin!)     But I hear the boy's voice chaunting sweet,    ?Elle est morte, la Marguerite.?     Come in, my son, and lie on the bed,    And let the dead folk bury their dead.     O mother, you know I loved her true:    O mother, hath one grave room for two?   THE DOLE OF THE KING?S DAUGHTER                                    (BRETON)     SEVEN stars in the still water,       And seven in the sky;    Seven sins on the King's daughter,       Deep in her soul to lie.     Red roses are at her feet,       (Roses are red in her red-gold hair)    And O where her bosom and girdle meet       Red roses are hidden there.     Fair is the knight who lieth slain       Amid the rush and reed,    See the lean fishes that are fain       Upon dead men to feed.     Sweet is the page that lieth there,       (Cloth of gold is goodly prey,)    See the black ravens in the air,       Black, O black as the night are they.     What do they there so stark and dead?       (There is blood upon her hand)    Why are the lilies flecked with red?       (There is blood on the river sand.)     There are two that ride from the south and east,       And two from the north and west,    For the black raven a goodly feast,       For the King's daughter rest.     There is one man who loves her true,       (Red, O red, is the stain of gore!)    He hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew,       (One grave will do for four.)     No moon in the still heaven,       In the black water none,    The sins on her soul are seven,       The sin upon his is one.   AMOR INTELLECTUALIS      OFT have we trod the vales of Castaly       And heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown       From antique reeds to common folk unknown:    And often launched our bark upon that sea    Which the nine Muses hold in empery,       And ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam,       Nor spread reluctant sail for more safe home    Till we had freighted well our argosy.    Of which despoil?d treasures these remain,       Sordello's passion, and the honeyed line    Of young Endymion, lordly Tamburlaine       Driving his pampered jades, and more than these,    The seven-fold vision of the Florentine,       And grave-browed Milton's solemn harmonies.   SANTA DECCA      THE Gods are dead: no longer do we bring       To grey-eyed Pallas crowns of olive-leaves!       Demeter's child no more hath tithe of sheaves,    And in the noon the careless shepherds sing,    For Pan is dead, and all the wantoning       By secret glade and devious haunt is o?er:       Young Hylas seeks the water-springs no more;    Great Pan is dead, and Mary's son is King.     And yet?perchance in this sea-tranc?d isle,       Chewing the bitter fruit of memory,       Some God lies hidden in the asphodel.    Ah Love! if such there be, then it were well       For us to fly his anger: nay, but see,       The leaves are stirring: let us watch awhile.  CORFU.   A VISION      TWO crown?d Kings, and One that stood alone       With no green weight of laurels round his head,       But with sad eyes as one uncomforted,    And wearied with man's never-ceasing moan    For sins no bleating victim can atone,       And sweet long lips with tears and kisses fed.       Girt was he in a garment black and red,    And at his feet I marked a broken stone       Which sent up lilies, dove-like, to his knees.    Now at their sight, my heart being lit with flame,    I cried to Beatric?, ?Who are these??    And she made answer, knowing well each name,       ?'schylos first, the second Sophokles,       And last (wide stream of tears!) Euripides.?   IMPRESSION DE VOYAGE      THE sea was sapphire coloured, and the sky       Burned like a heated opal through the air;       We hoisted sail; the wind was blowing fair    For the blue lands that to the eastward lie.    From the steep prow I marked with quickening eye       Zakynthos, every olive grove and creek,       Ithaca's cliff, Lycaon's snowy peak,    And all the flower-strewn hills of Arcady.       The flapping of the sail against the mast,       The ripple of the water on the side,    The ripple of girls? laughter at the stern,    The only sounds:?when ?gan the West to burn,       And a red sun upon the seas to ride,       I stood upon the soil of Greece at last!  KATAKOLO.   THE GRAVE OF SHELLEY      LIKE burnt-out torches by a sick man's bed       Gaunt cypress-trees stand round the sun-bleached stone;       Here doth the little night-owl make her throne,    And the slight lizard show his jewelled head.    And, where the chaliced poppies flame to red,       In the still chamber of yon pyramid       Surely some Old-World Sphinx lurks darkly hid,    Grim warder of this pleasaunce of the dead.     Ah! sweet indeed to rest within the womb       Of Earth, great mother of eternal sleep,    But sweeter far for thee a restless tomb       In the blue cavern of an echoing deep,    Or where the tall ships founder in the gloom       Against the rocks of some wave-shattered steep.  ROME.   BY THE ARNO         THE oleander on the wall       Grows crimson in the dawning light,       Though the grey shadows of the night    Lie yet on Florence like a pall.        The dew is bright upon the hill,       And bright the blossoms overhead,       But ah! the grasshoppers have fled,    The little Attic song is still.        Only the leaves are gently stirred       By the soft breathing of the gale,       And in the almond-scented vale    The lonely nightingale is heard.        The day will make thee silent soon,       O nightingale sing on for love!       While yet upon the shadowy grove    Splinter the arrows of the moon.        Before across the silent lawn       In sea-green vest the morning steals,       And to love's frightened eyes reveals    The long white fingers of the dawn        Fast climbing up the eastern sky       To grasp and slay the shuddering night,       All careless of my heart's delight,    Or if the nightingale should die.    IMPRESSIONS DE TH??TRE   FABIEN DEI FRANCHI                           TO MY FRIEND HENRY IRVING     THE silent room, the heavy creeping shade,       The dead that travel fast, the opening door,       The murdered brother rising through the floor,    The ghost's white fingers on thy shoulders laid,    And then the lonely duel in the glade,       The broken swords, the stifled scream, the gore,       Thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o?er,?

Ah! surely once some urn of Attic clay       Held thy wan dust, and thou hast come again       Back to this common world so dull and vain,    For thou wert weary of the sunless day,       The heavy fields of scentless asphodel,       The loveless lips with which men kiss in Hell.

Yet fairer when with wisdom as your shield       The sober-suited lawyer's gown you donned,    And would not let the laws of Venice yield       Antonio's heart to that accurs?d Jew?       O Portia! take my heart: it is thy due:    I think I will not quarrel with the Bond.   II QUEEN HENRIETTA MARIA                                 TO ELLEN TERRY     IN the lone tent, waiting for victory,       She stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain,       Like some wan lily overdrenched with rain:    The clamorous clang of arms, the ensanguined sky,    War's ruin, and the wreck of chivalry       To her proud soul no common fear can bring:       Bravely she tarrieth for her Lord the King,    Her soul a-flame with passionate ecstasy.    O Hair of Gold!  O Crimson Lips!  O Face       Made for the luring and the love of man!       With thee I do forget the toil and stress,    The loveless road that knows no resting place,       Time's straitened pulse, the soul's dread weariness,       My freedom, and my life republican!   III CAMMA                                 TO ELLEN TERRY     AS one who poring on a Grecian urn       Scans the fair shapes some Attic hand hath made,       God with slim goddess, goodly man with maid,    And for their beauty's sake is loth to turn    And face the obvious day, must I not yearn       For many a secret moon of indolent bliss,       When in midmost shrine of Artemis    I see thee standing, antique-limbed, and stern?     And yet?methinks I?d rather see thee play       That serpent of old Nile, whose witchery    Made Emperors drunken,?come, great Egypt, shake       Our stage with all thy mimic pageants!  Nay,       I am grown sick of unreal passions, make    The world thine Actium, me thine Anthony!    PANTHEA      NAY, let us walk from fire unto fire,       From passionate pain to deadlier delight,?    I am too young to live without desire,       Too young art thou to waste this summer night    Asking those idle questions which of old    Man sought of seer and oracle, and no reply was told.     For, sweet, to feel is better than to know,       And wisdom is a childless heritage,    One pulse of passion?youth's first fiery glow,?       Are worth the hoarded proverbs of the sage:    Vex not thy soul with dead philosophy,    Have we not lips to kiss with, hearts to love and eyes to see!     Dost thou not hear the murmuring nightingale,       Like water bubbling from a silver jar,    So soft she sings the envious moon is pale,       That high in heaven she is hung so far    She cannot hear that love-enraptured tune,?    Mark how she wreathes each horn with mist, yon late and labouring    moon.     White lilies, in whose cups the gold bees dream,       The fallen snow of petals where the breeze    Scatters the chestnut blossom, or the gleam       Of boyish limbs in water,?are not these    Enough for thee, dost thou desire more?    Alas! the Gods will give nought else from their eternal store.     For our high Gods have sick and wearied grown       Of all our endless sins, our vain endeavour    For wasted days of youth to make atone       By pain or prayer or priest, and never, never,    Hearken they now to either good or ill,    But send their rain upon the just and the unjust at will.     They sit at ease, our Gods they sit at ease,       Strewing with leaves of rose their scented wine,    They sleep, they sleep, beneath the rocking trees       Where asphodel and yellow lotus twine,    Mourning the old glad days before they knew    What evil things the heart of man could dream, and dreaming do.     And far beneath the brazen floor they see       Like swarming flies the crowd of little men,    The bustle of small lives, then wearily       Back to their lotus-haunts they turn again    Kissing each others? mouths, and mix more deep    The poppy-seeded draught which brings soft purple-lidded sleep.     There all day long the golden-vestured sun,       Their torch-bearer, stands with his torch ablaze,    And, when the gaudy web of noon is spun       By its twelve maidens, through the crimson haze    Fresh from Endymion's arms comes forth the moon,    And the immortal Gods in toils of mortal passions swoon.     There walks Queen Juno through some dewy mead,       Her grand white feet flecked with the saffron dust    Of wind-stirred lilies, while young Ganymede       Leaps in the hot and amber-foaming must,    His curls all tossed, as when the eagle bare    The frightened boy from Ida through the blue Ionian air.     There in the green heart of some garden close       Queen Venus with the shepherd at her side,    Her warm soft body like the briar rose       Which would be white yet blushes at its pride,    Laughs low for love, till jealous Salmacis    Peers through the myrtle-leaves and sighs for pain of lonely bliss.     There never does that dreary north-wind blow       Which leaves our English forests bleak and bare,    Nor ever falls the swift white-feathered snow,       Nor ever doth the red-toothed lightning dare    To wake them in the silver-fretted night    When we lie weeping for some sweet sad sin, some dead delight.     Alas! they know the far Leth?an spring,       The violet-hidden waters well they know,    Where one whose feet with tired wandering       Are faint and broken may take heart and go,    And from those dark depths cool and crystalline    Drink, and draw balm, and sleep for sleepless souls, and anodyne.     But we oppress our natures, God or Fate       Is our enemy, we starve and feed    On vain repentance?O we are born too late!       What balm for us in bruis?d poppy seed    Who crowd into one finite pulse of time    The joy of infinite love and the fierce pain of infinite crime.     O we are wearied of this sense of guilt,       Wearied of pleasure's paramour despair,    Wearied of every temple we have built,       Wearied of every right, unanswered prayer,    For man is weak; God sleeps: and heaven is high:    One fiery-coloured moment: one great love; and lo! we die.     Ah! but no ferry-man with labouring pole       Nears his black shallop to the flowerless strand,    No little coin of bronze can bring the soul       Over Death's river to the sunless land,    Victim and wine and vow are all in vain,    The tomb is sealed; the soldiers watch; the dead rise not again.     We are resolved into the supreme air,       We are made one with what we touch and see,    With our heart's blood each crimson sun is fair,       With our young lives each spring-impassioned tree    Flames into green, the wildest beasts that range    The moor our kinsmen are, all life is one, and all is change.     With beat of systole and of diastole       One grand great life throbs through earth's giant heart,    And mighty waves of single Being roll       From nerveless germ to man, for we are part    Of every rock and bird and beast and hill,    One with the things that prey on us, and one with what we kill.     From lower cells of waking life we pass       To full perfection; thus the world grows old:    We who are godlike now were once a mass       Of quivering purple flecked with bars of gold,    Unsentient or of joy or misery,    And tossed in terrible tangles of some wild and wind-swept sea.     This hot hard flame with which our bodies burn       Will make some meadow blaze with daffodil,    Ay! and those argent breasts of thine will turn       To water-lilies; the brown fields men till    Will be more fruitful for our love to-night,    Nothing is lost in nature, all things live in Death's despite.     The boy's first kiss, the hyacinth's first bell,       The man's last passion, and the last red spear    That from the lily leaps, the asphodel       Which will not let its blossoms blow for fear    Of too much beauty, and the timid shame    Of the young bridegroom at his lover's eyes,?these with the same     One sacrament are consecrate, the earth       Not we alone hath passions hymeneal,    The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth       At daybreak know a pleasure not less real    Than we do, when in some fresh-blossoming wood,    We draw the spring into our hearts, and feel that life is good.     So when men bury us beneath the yew       Thy crimson-stain?d mouth a rose will be,    And thy soft eyes lush bluebells dimmed with dew,       And when the white narcissus wantonly    Kisses the wind its playmate some faint joy    Will thrill our dust, and we will be again fond maid and boy.     And thus without life's conscious torturing pain       In some sweet flower we will feel the sun,    And from the linnet's throat will sing again,       And as two gorgeous-mail?d snakes will run    Over our graves, or as two tigers creep    Through the hot jungle where the yellow-eyed huge lions sleep     And give them battle!  How my heart leaps up       To think of that grand living after death    In beast and bird and flower, when this cup,       Being filled too full of spirit, bursts for breath,    And with the pale leaves of some autumn day    The soul earth's earliest conqueror becomes earth's last great prey.     O think of it!  We shall inform ourselves       Into all sensuous life, the goat-foot Faun,    The Centaur, or the merry bright-eyed Elves       That leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn    Upon the meadows, shall not be more near    Than you and I to nature's mysteries, for we shall hear     The thrush's heart beat, and the daisies grow,       And the wan snowdrop sighing for the sun    On sunless days in winter, we shall know       By whom the silver gossamer is spun,    Who paints the diapered fritillaries,    On what wide wings from shivering pine to pine the eagle flies.     Ay! had we never loved at all, who knows       If yonder daffodil had lured the bee    Into its gilded womb, or any rose       Had hung with crimson lamps its little tree!    Methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring,    But for the lovers? lips that kiss, the poets? lips that sing.     Is the light vanished from our golden sun,       Or is this d?dal-fashioned earth less fair,    That we are nature's heritors, and one       With every pulse of life that beats the air?    Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,    New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass.     And we two lovers shall not sit afar,       Critics of nature, but the joyous sea    Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star       Shoot arrows at our pleasure!  We shall be    Part of the mighty universal whole,    And through all ?ons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!     We shall be notes in that great Symphony       Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,    And all the live World's throbbing heart shall be       One with our heart; the stealthy creeping years    Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,    The Universe itself shall be our Immortality.    THE FOURTH MOVEMENT   IMPRESSION                                  LE R?VEILLON        THE sky is laced with fitful red,       The circling mists and shadows flee,       The dawn is rising from the sea,    Like a white lady from her bed.        And jagged brazen arrows fall       Athwart the feathers of the night,       And a long wave of yellow light    Breaks silently on tower and hall,        And spreading wide across the wold       Wakes into flight some fluttering bird,       And all the chestnut tops are stirred,    And all the branches streaked with gold.   AT VERONA      HOW steep the stairs within Kings? houses are       For exile-wearied feet as mine to tread,       And O how salt and bitter is the bread    Which falls from this Hound's table,?better far    That I had died in the red ways of war,       Or that the gate of Florence bare my head,       Than to live thus, by all things comraded    Which seek the essence of my soul to mar.     ?Curse God and die: what better hope than this?       He hath forgotten thee in all the bliss       Of his gold city, and eternal day??    Nay peace: behind my prison's blinded bars       I do possess what none can take away       My love, and all the glory of the stars.   APOLOGIA      IS it thy will that I should wax and wane,       Barter my cloth of gold for hodden grey,    And at thy pleasure weave that web of pain       Whose brightest threads are each a wasted day?     Is it thy will?Love that I love so well?       That my Soul's House should be a tortured spot    Wherein, like evil paramours, must dwell       The quenchless flame, the worm that dieth not?     Nay, if it be thy will I shall endure,       And sell ambition at the common mart,    And let dull failure be my vestiture,       And sorrow dig its grave within my heart.     Perchance it may be better so?at least       I have not made my heart a heart of stone,    Nor starved my boyhood of its goodly feast,       Nor walked where Beauty is a thing unknown.     Many a man hath done so; sought to fence       In straitened bonds the soul that should be free,    Trodden the dusty road of common sense,       While all the forest sang of liberty,     Not marking how the spotted hawk in flight       Passed on wide pinion through the lofty air,    To where some steep untrodden mountain height       Caught the last tresses of the Sun God's hair.     Or how the little flower he trod upon,       The daisy, that white-feathered shield of gold,    Followed with wistful eyes the wandering sun       Content if once its leaves were aureoled.     But surely it is something to have been       The best belov?d for a little while,    To have walked hand in hand with Love, and seen       His purple wings flit once across thy smile.     Ay! though the gorg?d asp of passion feed       On my boy's heart, yet have I burst the bars,    Stood face to face with Beauty, known indeed       The Love which moves the Sun and all the stars!   QUIA MULTUM AMAVI      DEAR Heart, I think the young impassioned priest       When first he takes from out the hidden shrine    His God imprisoned in the Eucharist,       And eats the bread, and drinks the dreadful wine,     Feels not such awful wonder as I felt       When first my smitten eyes beat full on thee,    And all night long before thy feet I knelt       Till thou wert wearied of Idolatry.     Ah! hadst thou liked me less and loved me more,       Through all those summer days of joy and rain,    I had not now been sorrow's heritor,       Or stood a lackey in the House of Pain.     Yet, though remorse, youth's white-faced seneschal,       Tread on my heels with all his retinue,    I am most glad I loved thee?think of all       The suns that go to make one speedwell blue!   SILENTIUM AMORIS      AS often-times the too resplendent sun       Hurries the pallid and reluctant moon    Back to her sombre cave, ere she hath won       A single ballad from the nightingale,       So doth thy Beauty make my lips to fail,    And all my sweetest singing out of tune.     And as at dawn across the level mead       On wings impetuous some wind will come,    And with its too harsh kisses break the reed       Which was its only instrument of song,       So my too stormy passions work me wrong,    And for excess of Love my Love is dumb.     But surely unto Thee mine eyes did show       Why I am silent, and my lute unstrung;    Else it were better we should part, and go,       Thou to some lips of sweeter melody,       And I to nurse the barren memory    Of unkissed kisses, and songs never sung.   HER VOICE      THE wild bee reels from bough to bough       With his furry coat and his gauzy wing,    Now in a lily-cup, and now       Setting a jacinth bell a-swing,             In his wandering;    Sit closer love: it was here I trow             I made that vow,     Swore that two lives should be like one       As long as the sea-gull loved the sea,    As long as the sunflower sought the sun,?       It shall be, I said, for eternity             ?Twixt you and me!    Dear friend, those times are over and done;             Love's web is spun.     Look upward where the poplar trees       Sway and sway in the summer air,    Here in the valley never a breeze       Scatters the thistledown, but there             Great winds blow fair    From the mighty murmuring mystical seas,             And the wave-lashed leas.     Look upward where the white gull screams,       What does it see that we do not see?    Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams       On some outward voyaging argosy,?             Ah! can it be    We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!             How sad it seems.     Sweet, there is nothing left to say       But this, that love is never lost,    Keen winter stabs the breasts of May       Whose crimson roses bur|2
74|st his frost,             Ships tempest-tossed    Will find a harbour in some bay,             And so we may.     And there is nothing left to do       But to kiss once again, and part,    Nay, there is nothing we should rue,       I have my beauty,?you your Art,             Nay, do not start,    One world was not enough for two             Like me and you.   MY VOICE      WITHIN this restless, hurried, modern world       We took our hearts? full pleasure?You and I,    And now the white sails of our ship are furled,       And spent the lading of our argosy.     Wherefore my cheeks before their time are wan,       For very weeping is my gladness fled,    Sorrow has paled my young mouth's vermilion,       And Ruin draws the curtains of my bed.     But all this crowded life has been to thee       No more than lyre, or lute, or subtle spell    Of viols, or the music of the sea       That sleeps, a mimic echo, in the shell.   T?DIUM VIT?      TO stab my youth with desperate knives, to wear    This paltry age's gaudy livery,    To let each base hand filch my treasury,    To mesh my soul within a woman's hair,    And be mere Fortune's lackeyed groom,?I swear    I love it not! these things are less to me    Than the thin foam that frets upon the sea,    Less than the thistledown of summer air    Which hath no seed: better to stand aloof    Far from these slanderous fools who mock my life    Knowing me not, better the lowliest roof    Fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in,    Than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife    Where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin.    HUMANITAD      IT is full winter now: the trees are bare,       Save where the cattle huddle from the cold    Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear       The autumn's gaudy livery whose gold    Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true    To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew     From Saturn's cave; a few thin wisps of hay       Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain    Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer's day       From the low meadows up the narrow lane;    Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep    Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep     From the shut stable to the frozen stream       And back again disconsolate, and miss    The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;       And overhead in circling listlessness    The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,    Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack     Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds       And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,    And hoots to see the moon; across the meads       Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;    And a stray seamew with its fretful cry    Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.     Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings       His load of faggots from the chilly byre,    And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings       The sappy billets on the waning fire,    And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare    His children at their play, and yet,?the spring is in the air;     Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,       And soon yon blanch?d fields will bloom again    With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,       For with the first warm kisses of the rain    The winter's icy sorrow breaks to tears,    And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers     From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,       And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs    Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly       Across our path at evening, and the suns    Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see    Grass-girdled spring in all her joy of laughing greenery     Dance through the hedges till the early rose,       (That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)    Burst from its sheath?d emerald and disclose       The little quivering disk of golden fire    Which the bees know so well, for with it come    Pale boy's-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.     Then up and down the field the sower goes,       While close behind the laughing younker scares    With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,       And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,    And on the grass the creamy blossom falls    In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals     Steal from the bluebells? nodding carillons       Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,    That star of its own heaven, snap-dragons       With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine    In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed    And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed     Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,       And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,    Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy       Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,    And violets getting overbold withdraw    From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.     O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!       Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock    And crown of flower-de-luce trip down the lea,       Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock    Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon    Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at noon.     Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,       The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns    Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture       Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations    With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,    And straggling traveller's-joy each hedge with yellow stars will bind.     Dear bride of Nature and most bounteous spring,       That canst give increase to the sweet-breath?d kine,    And to the kid its little horns, and bring       The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,    Where is that old nepenthe which of yore    Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!     There was a time when any common bird       Could make me sing in unison, a time    When all the strings of boyish life were stirred       To quick response or more melodious rhyme    By every forest idyll;?do I change?    Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?     Nay, nay, thou art the same: ?tis I who seek       To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,    And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek       Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;    Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare    To taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair!     Thou art the same: ?tis I whose wretched soul       Takes discontent to be its paramour,    And gives its kingdom to the rude control       Of what should be its servitor,?for sure    Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea    Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ??Tis not in me.?     To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect       In natural honour, not to bend the knee    In profitless prostrations whose effect       Is by itself condemned, what alchemy    Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed    Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?     The minor chord which ends the harmony,       And for its answering brother waits in vain    Sobbing for incompleted melody,       Dies a swan's death; but I the heir of pain,    A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes,    Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.     The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,       The little dust stored in the narrow urn,    The gentle ????? of the Attic tomb,?       Were not these better far than to return    To my old fitful restless malady,    Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?     Nay! for perchance that poppy-crown?d god       Is like the watcher by a sick man's bed    Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod       Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,    Death is too rude, too obvious a key    To solve one single secret in a life's philosophy.     And Love! that noble madness, whose august       And inextinguishable might can slay    The soul with honeyed drugs,?alas! I must       From such sweet ruin play the runaway,    Although too constant memory never can    Forget the arch?d splendour of those brows Olympian     Which for a little season made my youth       So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence    That all the chiding of more prudent Truth       Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,?O hence    Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!    Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss.     My lips have drunk enough,?no more, no more,?       Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow    Back to the troubled waters of this shore       Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now    The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,    Hence!  Hence!  I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.     More barren?ay, those arms will never lean       Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul    In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;       Some other head must wear that aureole,    For I am hers who loves not any man    Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.     Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,       And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,    With net and spear and hunting equipage       Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,    But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell    Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.     Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy       Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud    Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy       And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed    In wonder at her feet, not for the sake    Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.     Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!       And, if my lips be musicless, inspire    At least my life: was not thy glory hymned       By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre    Like 'schylos at well-fought Marathon,    And died to show that Milton's England still could bear a son!     And yet I cannot tread the Portico       And live without desire, fear and pain,    Or nurture that wise calm which long ago       The grave Athenian master taught to men,    Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,    To watch the world's vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.     Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,       Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,    Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse       Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne    Is childless; in the night which she had made    For lofty secure flight Athena's owl itself hath strayed.     Nor much with Science do I care to climb,       Although by strange and subtle witchery    She drew the moon from heaven: the Muse Time       Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry    To no less eager eyes; often indeed    In the great epic of Polymnia's scroll I love to read     How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war       Against a little town, and panoplied    In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar,       White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede    Between the waving poplars and the sea    Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopyl?     Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,       And on the nearer side a little brood    Of careless lions holding festival!       And stood amaz?d at such hardihood,    And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,    And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o?er     Some unfrequented height, and coming down       The autumn forests treacherously slew    What Sparta held most dear and was the crown       Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew    How God had staked an evil net for him    In the small bay at Salamis,?and yet, the page grows dim,     Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel       With such a goodly time too out of tune    To love it much: for like the Dial's wheel       That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon    Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes    Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.     O for one grand unselfish simple life       To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills    Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife       Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,    Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly    Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!     Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is he       Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul    Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty       Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal    Where love and duty mingle!  Him at least    The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom's feast;     But we are Learning's changelings, know by rote       The clarion watchword of each Grecian school    And follow none, the flawless sword which smote       The pagan Hydra is an effete tool    Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now    Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?     One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!       Gone is that last dear son of Italy,    Who being man died for the sake of God,       And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully,    O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower,    Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour     Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or       The Arno with its tawny troubled gold    O?er-leap its marge, no mightier conqueror       Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old    When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty    Walked like a bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery     Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell       With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,    Fled shuddering, for that immemorial knell       With which oblivion buries dynasties    Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,    As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.     He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,       He drave the base wolf from the lion's lair,    And now lies dead by that empyreal dome       Which overtops Valdarno hung in air    By Brunelleschi?O Melpomene    Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!     Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies       That Joy's self may grow jealous, and the Nine    Forget awhile their discreet emperies,       Mourning for him who on Rome's lordliest shrine    Lit for men's lives the light of Marathon,    And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!     O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto's tower!       Let some young Florentine each eventide    Bring coronals of that enchanted flower       Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,    And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies    Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes;     Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,       Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim    Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings       Of the eternal chanting Cherubim    Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away    Into a moonless void,?and yet, though he is dust and clay,     He is not dead, the immemorial Fates       Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain.    Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!       Ye argent clarions, sound a loftier strain    For the vile thing he hated lurks within    Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin.     Still what avails it that she sought her cave       That murderous mother of red harlotries?    At Munich on the marble architrave       The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas    Which wash ?gina fret in loneliness    Not mirroring their beauty; so our lives grow colourless     For lack of our ideals, if one star       Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust    Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war       Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust    Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe    For all her stony sorrows hath her sons; but Italy,     What Easter Day shall make her children rise,       Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet    Shall find their grave-clothes folded? what clear eyes       Shall see them bodily?  O it were meet    To roll the stone from off the sepulchre    And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of her,     Our Italy! our mother visible!       Most blessed among nations and most sad,    For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell       That day at Aspromonte and was glad    That in an age when God was bought and sold    One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,     See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves       Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty    Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives       Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,    And no word said:?O we are wretched men    Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen     Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword       Which slew its master righteously? the years    Have lost their ancient leader, and no word       Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:    While as a ruined mother in some spasm    Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm     Genders unlawful children, Anarchy       Freedom's own Judas, the vile prodigal    Licence who steals the gold of Liberty       And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real    One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp    That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp     Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed       For whose dull appetite men waste away    Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed       Of things which slay their sower, these each day    Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet    Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.     What even Cromwell spared is desecrated       By weed and worm, left to the stormy play    Of wind and beating snow, or renovated       By more destructful hands: Time's worst decay    Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,    But these new Vandals can but make a rain-proof barrenness.     Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing       Through Lincoln's lofty choir, till the air    Seems from such marble harmonies to ring       With sweeter song than common lips can dare    To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now    The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow     For Southwell's arch, and carved the House of One       Who loved the lilies of the field with all    Our dearest English flowers? the same sun       Rises for us: the seasons natural    Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:    The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.     And yet perchance it may be better so,       For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,    Murder her brother is her bedfellow,       And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene    And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;    Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!     For gentle brotherhood, the harmony       Of living in the healthful air, the swift    Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free       And women chaste, these are the things which lift    Our souls up more than even Agnolo's    Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o?er the scroll of human woes,     Or Titian's little maiden on the stair       White as her own sweet lily and as tall,    Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,?       Ah! somehow life is bigger after all    Than any painted angel, could we see    The God that is within us!  The old Greek serenity     Which curbs the passion of that level line       Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes    And chastened limbs ride round Athena's shrine       And mirror her divine economies,    And balanced symmetry of what in man    Would else wage ceaseless warfare,?this at least within the span     Between our mother's kisses and the grave       Might so inform our lives, that we could win    Such mighty empires that from her cave       Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin    Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,    And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.     To make the body and the spirit one       With all right things, till no thing live in vain    From morn to noon, but in sweet unison       With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain    The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,    Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,     Mark with serene impartiality       The strife of things, and yet be comforted,    Knowing that by the chain causality       All separate existences are wed    Into one supreme whole, whose utterance    Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance     Of Life in most august omnipresence,       Through which the rational intellect would find    In passion its expression, and mere sense,       Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,    And being joined with it in harmony    More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,     Strike from their several tones one octave chord       Whose cadence being measureless would fly    Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord       Return refreshed with its new empery    And more exultant power,?this indeed    Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.     Ah! it was easy when the world was young       To keep one's life free and inviolate,    From our sad lips another song is rung,       By our own hands our heads are desecrate,    Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed    Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.     Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,       And of all men we are most wretched who    Must live each other's lives and not our own       For very pity's sake and then undo    All that we lived for?it was otherwise    When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.     But we have left those gentle haunts to pass       With weary feet to the new Calvary,    Where we behold, as one who in a glass       Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,    And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze    Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.     O smitten mouth!  O forehead crowned with thorn!       O chalice of all common miseries!    Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne       An agony of endless centuries,    And we were vain and ignorant nor knew    That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew.     Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,       The night that covers and the lights that fade,    The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,       The lips betraying and the life betrayed;    The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we    Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.     Is this the end of all that primal force       Which, in its changes being still the same,    From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,       Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,    Till the suns met in heaven and began    Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!     Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though       The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain    Loosen the nails?we shall come down I know,       Staunch the red wounds?we shall be whole again,    No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,    That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God.    FLOWER OF LOVE   ??????????? ????      SWEET, I blame you not, for mine the fault       was, had I not been made of common clay    I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed       yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.     From the wildness of my wasted passion I had       struck a better, clearer song,    Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled       with some Hydra-headed wrong.     Had my lips been smitten into music by the       kisses that but made them bleed,    You had walked with Bice and the angels on       that verdant and enamelled mead.     I had trod the road which Dante treading saw       the suns of seven circles shine,    Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,       as they opened to the Florentine.     And the mighty nations would have crowned       me, who am crownless now and without name,    And some orient dawn had found me kneeling       on the threshold of the House of Fame.     I had sat within that marble circle where the       oldest bard is as the young,    And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the       lyre's strings are ever strung.     Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out       the poppy-seeded wine,    With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,       clasped the hand of noble love in mine.     And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush       the burnished bosom of the dove,    Two young lovers lying in an orchard would       have read the story of our love.     Would have read the legend of my passion,       known the bitter secret of my heart,    Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as       we two are fated now to part.     For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by       the cankerworm of truth,    And no hand can gather up the fallen withered       petals of the rose of youth.     Yet I am not sorry that I loved you?ah! what       else had I a boy to do,?    For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the       silent-footed years pursue.     Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and       when once the storm of youth is past,    Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death       the silent pilot comes at last.     And within the grave there is no pleasure, for       the blindworm battens on the root,    And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree of       Passion bears no fruit.     Ah! what else had I to do but love you, God's       own mother was less dear to me,    And less dear the Cyther?an rising like an       argent lily from the sea.     I have made my choice, have lived my poems,       and, though youth is gone in wasted days,    I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better       than the poet's crown of bays.     UNCOLLECTED POEMS   FROM SPRING DAYS TO WINTER                                  (FOR MUSIC)     IN the glad springtime when leaves were green,       O merrily the throstle sings!    I sought, amid the tangled sheen,    Love whom mine eyes had never seen,       O the glad dove has golden wings!     Between the blossoms red and white,       O merrily the throstle sings!    My love first came into my sight,    O perfect vision of delight,       O the glad dove has golden wings!     The yellow apples glowed like fire,       O merrily the throstle sings!    O Love too great for lip or lyre,    Blown rose of love and of desire,       O the glad dove has golden wings!     But now with snow the tree is grey,       Ah, sadly now the throstle sings!    My love is dead: ah! well-a-day,    See at her silent feet I lay       A dove with broken wings!       Ah, Love! ah, Love! that thou wert slain?    Fond Dove, fond Dove return again!    TRISTIT?                  _???????_, _??????? ????_, _?? ?? ?? ??????_     O WELL for him who lives at ease       With garnered gold in wide domain,       Nor heeds the splashing of the rain,    The crashing down of forest trees.     O well for him who ne?er hath known       The travail of the hungry years,       A father grey with grief and tears,    A mother weeping all alone.     But well for him whose foot hath trod       The weary road of toil and strife,       Yet from the sorrows of his life.    Builds ladders to be nearer God.    THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE      . . . _???y????? ?? ????_    _???? ???????? ???? ???????? ??????_,    _??? ??? y?? ????? ??? ?? y?_.     THOU knowest all; I seek in vain       What lands to till or sow with seed?       The land is black with briar and weed,    Nor cares for falling tears or rain.     Thou knowest all; I sit and wait       With blinded eyes and hands that fail,       Till the last lifting of the veil    And the first opening of the gate.     Thou knowest all; I cannot see.       I trust I shall not live in vain,       I know that we shall meet again    In some divine eternity.    IMPRESSIONS   I LE JARDIN      THE lily's withered chalice falls       Around its rod of dusty gold,       And from the beech-trees on the wold    The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.     The gaudy leonine sunflower       Hangs black and barren on its stalk,       And down the windy garden walk    The dead leaves scatter,?hour by hour.     Pale privet-petals white as milk       Are blown into a snowy mass:       The roses lie upon the grass    Like little shreds of crimson silk.   II LA MER      A WHITE mist drifts across the shrouds,       A wild moon in this wintry sky       Gleams like an angry lion's eye    Out of a mane of tawny clouds.     The muffled steersman at the wheel       Is but a shadow in the gloom;?       And in the throbbing engine-room    Leap the long rods of pol|2
75|ished steel.     The shattered storm has left its trace       Upon this huge and heaving dome,       For the thin threads of yellow foam    Float on the waves like ravelled lace.    UNDER THE BALCONY      O BEAUTIFUL star with the crimson mouth!       O moon with the brows of gold!    Rise up, rise up, from the odorous south!          And light for my love her way,          Lest her little feet should stray       On the windy hill and the wold!    O beautiful star with the crimson mouth!       O moon with the brows of gold!     O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!       O ship with the wet, white sail!    Put in, put in, to the port to me!          For my love and I would go          To the land where the daffodils blow       In the heart of a violet dale!    O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!       O ship with the wet, white sail!     O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!       O bird that sits on the spray!    Sing on, sing on, from your soft brown throat!          And my love in her little bed          Will listen, and lift her head       From the pillow, and come my way!    O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!       O bird that sits on the spray!     O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!       O blossom with lips of snow!    Come down, come down, for my love to wear!          You will die on her head in a crown,          You will die in a fold of her gown,       To her little light heart you will go!    O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!       O blossom with lips of snow!    THE HARLOT?S HOUSE      WE caught the tread of dancing feet,    We loitered down the moonlit street,    And stopped beneath the harlot's house.     Inside, above the din and fray,    We heard the loud musicians play    The ?Treues Liebes Herz? of Strauss.     Like strange mechanical grotesques,    Making fantastic arabesques,    The shadows raced across the blind.     We watched the ghostly dancers spin    To sound of horn and violin,    Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.     Like wire-pulled automatons,    Slim silhouetted skeletons    Went sidling through the slow quadrille,     Then took each other by the hand,    And danced a stately saraband;    Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.     Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed    A phantom lover to her breast,    Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.     Sometimes a horrible marionette    Came out, and smoked its cigarette    Upon the steps like a live thing.     Then, turning to my love, I said,    ?The dead are dancing with the dead,    The dust is whirling with the dust.?     But she'she heard the violin,    And left my side, and entered in:    Love passed into the house of lust.     Then suddenly the tune went false,    The dancers wearied of the waltz,    The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.     And down the long and silent street,    The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,    Crept like a frightened girl.    LE JARDIN DES TUILERIES      THIS winter air is keen and cold,       And keen and cold this winter sun,       But round my chair the children run    Like little things of dancing gold.     Sometimes about the painted kiosk       The mimic soldiers strut and stride,       Sometimes the blue-eyed brigands hide    In the bleak tangles of the bosk.     And sometimes, while the old nurse cons       Her book, they steal across the square,       And launch their paper navies where    Huge Triton writhes in greenish bronze.     And now in mimic flight they flee,       And now they rush, a boisterous band?       And, tiny hand on tiny hand,    Climb up the black and leafless tree.     Ah! cruel tree! if I were you,       And children climbed me, for their sake       Though it be winter I would break    Into spring blossoms white and blue!    ON THE SALE BY AUCTION OF KEATS? LOVE LETTERS      THESE are the letters which Endymion wrote       To one he loved in secret, and apart.       And now the brawlers of the auction mart    Bargain and bid for each poor blotted note,    Ay! for each separate pulse of passion quote       The merchant's price.  I think they love not art       Who break the crystal of a poet's heart    That small and sickly eyes may glare and gloat.     Is it not said that many years ago,       In a far Eastern town, some soldiers ran       With torches through the midnight, and began    To wrangle for mean raiment, and to throw       Dice for the garments of a wretched man,    Not knowing the God's wonder, or His woe?    THE NEW REMORSE      THE sin was mine; I did not understand.       So now is music prisoned in her cave,       Save where some ebbing desultory wave    Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.    And in the withered hollow of this land       Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,       That hardly can the leaden willow crave    One silver blossom from keen Winter's hand.     But who is this who cometh by the shore?    (Nay, love, look up and wonder!)  Who is this       Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?    It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss       The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,    And I shall weep and worship, as before.    FANTAISIES D?CORATIVES   I LE PANNEAU      UNDER the rose-tree's dancing shade       There stands a little ivory girl,       Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl    With pale green nails of polished jade.     The red leaves fall upon the mould,       The white leaves flutter, one by one,       Down to a blue bowl where the sun,    Like a great dragon, writhes in gold.     The white leaves float upon the air,       The red leaves flutter idly down,       Some fall upon her yellow gown,    And some upon her raven hair.     She takes an amber lute and sings,       And as she sings a silver crane       Begins his scarlet neck to strain,    And flap his burnished metal wings.     She takes a lute of amber bright,       And from the thicket where he lies       Her lover, with his almond eyes,    Watches her movements in delight.     And now she gives a cry of fear,       And tiny tears begin to start:       A thorn has wounded with its dart    The pink-veined sea-shell of her ear.     And now she laughs a merry note:       There has fallen a petal of the rose       Just where the yellow satin shows    The blue-veined flower of her throat.     With pale green nails of polished jade,       Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl,       There stands a little ivory girl    Under the rose-tree's dancing shade.   II LES BALLONS      AGAINST these turbid turquoise skies       The light and luminous balloons       Dip and drift like satin moons,    Drift like silken butterflies;     Reel with every windy gust,       Rise and reel like dancing girls,       Float like strange transparent pearls,    Fall and float like silver dust.     Now to the low leaves they cling,       Each with coy fantastic pose,       Each a petal of a rose    Straining at a gossamer string.     Then to the tall trees they climb,       Like thin globes of amethyst,       Wandering opals keeping tryst    With the rubies of the lime.    CANZONET         I HAVE no store    Of gryphon-guarded gold;       Now, as before,    Bare is the shepherd's fold.       Rubies nor pearls    Have I to gem thy throat;       Yet woodland girls    Have loved the shepherd's note.        Then pluck a reed    And bid me sing to thee,       For I would feed    Thine ears with melody,       Who art more fair    Than fairest fleur-de-lys,       More sweet and rare    Than sweetest ambergris.        What dost thou fear?    Young Hyacinth is slain,       Pan is not here,    And will not come again.       No horn?d Faun    Treads down the yellow leas,       No God at dawn    Steals through the olive trees.        Hylas is dead,    Nor will he e?er divine       Those little red    Rose-petalled lips of thine.       On the high hill    No ivory dryads play,       Silver and still    Sinks the sad autumn day.    SYMPHONY IN YELLOW      AN omnibus across the bridge       Crawls like a yellow butterfly,       And, here and there, a passer-by    Shows like a little restless midge.     Big barges full of yellow hay       Are moored against the shadowy wharf,       And, like a yellow silken scarf,    The thick fog hangs along the quay.     The yellow leaves begin to fade       And flutter from the Temple elms,       And at my feet the pale green Thames    Lies like a rod of rippled jade.    IN THE FOREST      OUT of the mid-wood's twilight       Into the meadow's dawn,    Ivory limbed and brown-eyed,       Flashes my Faun!     He skips through the copses singing,       And his shadow dances along,    And I know not which I should follow,       Shadow or song!     O Hunter, snare me his shadow!       O Nightingale, catch me his strain!    Else moonstruck with music and madness       I track him in vain!    TO MY WIFE                            WITH A COPY OF MY POEMS     I CAN write no stately proem       As a prelude to my lay;    From a poet to a poem       I would dare to say.     For if of these fallen petals       One to you seem fair,    Love will waft it till it settles       On your hair.     And when wind and winter harden       All the loveless land,    It will whisper of the garden,       You will understand.    WITH A COPY OF ?A HOUSE OF POMEGRANATES?      GO, little book,    To him who, on a lute with horns of pearl,    Sang of the white feet of the Golden Girl:    And bid him look    Into thy pages: it may hap that he    May find that golden maidens dance through thee.    ROSES AND RUE                                   (To L. L.)     COULD we dig up this long-buried treasure,       Were it worth the pleasure,    We never could learn love's song,       We are parted too long.     Could the passionate past that is fled       Call back its dead,    Could we live it all over again,       Were it worth the pain!     I remember we used to meet       By an ivied seat,    And you warbled each pretty word       With the air of a bird;     And your voice had a quaver in it,       Just like a linnet,    And shook, as the blackbird's throat       With its last big note;     And your eyes, they were green and grey       Like an April day,    But lit into amethyst       When I stooped and kissed;     And your mouth, it would never smile       For a long, long while,    Then it rippled all over with laughter       Five minutes after.     You were always afraid of a shower,       Just like a flower:    I remember you started and ran       When the rain began.     I remember I never could catch you,       For no one could match you,    You had wonderful, luminous, fleet,       Little wings to your feet.     I remember your hair?did I tie it?       For it always ran riot?    Like a tangled sunbeam of gold:       These things are old.     I remember so well the room,       And the lilac bloom    That beat at the dripping pane       In the warm June rain;     And the colour of your gown,       It was amber-brown,    And two yellow satin bows       From your shoulders rose.     And the handkerchief of French lace       Which you held to your face?    Had a small tear left a stain?       Or was it the rain?     On your hand as it waved adieu       There were veins of blue;    In your voice as it said good-bye       Was a petulant cry,     ?You have only wasted your life.?       (Ah, that was the knife!)    When I rushed through the garden gate       It was all too late.     Could we live it over again,       Were it worth the pain,    Could the passionate past that is fled       Call back its dead!     Well, if my heart must break,       Dear love, for your sake,    It will break in music, I know,       Poets? hearts break so.     But strange that I was not told       That the brain can hold    In a tiny ivory cell       God's heaven and hell.    D?SESPOIR      THE seasons send their ruin as they go,    For in the spring the narciss shows its head    Nor withers till the rose has flamed to red,    And in the autumn purple violets blow,    And the slim crocus stirs the winter snow;    Wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom again    And this grey land grow green with summer rain    And send up cowslips for some boy to mow.     But what of life whose bitter hungry sea    Flows at our heels, and gloom of sunless night    Covers the days which never more return?    Ambition, love and all the thoughts that burn    We lose too soon, and only find delight    In withered husks of some dead memory.    PAN                               DOUBLE VILLANELLE                                        I     O goat-foot God of Arcady!    This modern world is grey and old,    And what remains to us of thee?     No more the shepherd lads in glee    Throw apples at thy wattled fold,    O goat-foot God of Arcady!     Nor through the laurels can one see    Thy soft brown limbs, thy beard of gold,    And what remains to us of thee?     And dull and dead our Thames would be,    For here the winds are chill and cold,    O goat-foot God of Arcady!     Then keep the tomb of Helice,    Thine olive-woods, thy vine-clad wold,    And what remains to us of thee?     Though many an unsung elegy    Sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold,    O goat-foot God of Arcady!    Ah, what remains to us of thee?                                       II     Ah, leave the hills of Arcady,    Thy satyrs and their wanton play,    This modern world hath need of thee.     No nymph or Faun indeed have we,    For Faun and nymph are old and grey,    Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!     This is the land where liberty    Lit grave-browed Milton on his way,    This modern world hath need of thee!     A land of ancient chivalry    Where gentle Sidney saw the day,    Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!     This fierce sea-lion of the sea,    This England lacks some stronger lay,    This modern world hath need of thee!     Then blow some trumpet loud and free,    And give thine oaten pipe away,    Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!    This modern world hath need of thee!     THE SPHINX     IN a dim corner of my room for longer than my fancy thinks    A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting    gloom.     Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she does not stir    For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that    reel.     Red follows grey across the air, the waves of moonlight ebb and flow    But with the Dawn she does not go and in the night-time she is there.     Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and all the while this curious    cat    Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.     Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the tawny throat of her    Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her pointed ears.     Come forth, my lovely seneschal! so somnolent, so statuesque!    Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman and half animal!     Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and put your head upon my    knee!    And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx!     And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory and grasp    The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round your heavy velvet paws!                                       A THOUSAND weary centuries are thine while I have hardly seen    Some twenty summers cast their green for Autumn's gaudy liveries.     But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks,    And you have talked with Basilisks, and you have looked on    Hippogriffs.     O tell me, were you standing by when Isis to Osiris knelt?    And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union for Antony     And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend her head in mimic awe    To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny from the brine?     And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon on his catafalque?    And did you follow Amenalk, the God of Heliopolis?     And did you talk with Thoth, and did you hear the moon-horned Io weep?    And know the painted kings who sleep beneath the wedge-shaped Pyramid?                                       LIFT up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one    sinks!    Fawn at my feet, fantastic Sphinx! and sing me all your memories!     Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered with the Holy Child,    And how you led them through the wild, and how they slept beneath your    shade.     Sing to me of that odorous green eve when crouching by the marge    You heard from Adrian's gilded barge the laughter of Antinous     And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and    hungry stare    The ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth!     Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-formed bull was stalled!    Sing to me of the night you crawled across the temple's granite plinth     When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew    In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning Mandragores,     And the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears,    And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the Nile,     And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you    seized their snake    And crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms.                                       WHO were your lovers? who were they who wrestled for you in the dust?    Which was the vessel of your Lust?  What Leman had you, every day?     Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you on the reedy banks?    Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled    couch?     Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward you in the mist?    Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed    them by?     And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what horrible Chimera came    With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed new wonders from your    womb?                                       OR had you shameful secret quests and did you harry to your home    Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasts?     Or did you treading through the froth call to the brown Sidonian    For tidings of Leviathan, Leviathan or Behemoth?     Or did you when the sun was set climb up the cactus-covered slope    To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was of polished jet?     Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped down the grey Nilotic    flats    At twilight and the flickering bats flew round the temple's triple    glyphs     Steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake    And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid your l?panar     Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swath?d dead?    Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned Tragelaphos?     Or did you love the god of flies who plagued the Hebrews and was    splashed    With wine unto the waist? or Pasht, who had green beryls for her eyes?     Or that young god, the Tyrian, who was more amorous than the dove    Of Ashtaroth? or did you love the god of the Assyrian     Whose wings, like strange transparent talc, rose high above his    hawk-faced head,    Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with rods of Oreichalch?     Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and lay before your feet    Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured nenuphar?                                       HOW subtle-secret is your smile!  Did you love none then?  Nay, I know    Great Ammon was your bedfellow!  He lay with you beside the Nile!     The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when they saw him come    Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with spikenard and with    thyme.     He came along the river bank like some tall galley argent-sailed,    He strode across the waters, mailed in beauty, and the waters sank.     He strode across the desert sand: he reached the valley where you lay:    He waited till the dawn of day: then touched your black breasts with    his hand.     You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame: you made the horn?d god    your own:    You stood behind him on his throne: you called him by his secret name.     You whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears:    With blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous    miracles.     White Ammon was your bedfellow!  Your chamber was the steaming Nile!    And with your curved archaic smile you watched his passion come and    go.                                       WITH Syrian oils his brows were bright: and wide-spread as a tent at    noon    His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent the day a larger light.     His long hair was nine cubits? span and coloured like that yellow gem    Which hidden in their garment's hem the merchants bring from    Kurdistan.     His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of new-made wine:    The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure of his eyes.     His thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veins    of blue:    And curious pearls like frozen dew were broidered on his flowing silk.                                       ON pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was too bright to look upon:    For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous ocean-emerald,     That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of the Colchian caves    Had found beneath the blackening waves and carried to the Colchian    witch.     Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed corybants,    And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot,     And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter as he rode    Down the great granite-paven road between the nodding peacock-fans.     The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon in their painted ships:    The meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite.     The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich apparel bound with    cords:    His train was borne by Memphian lords: young kings were glad to be his    guests.     Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon's altar day and night,    Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through Ammon's carven    house?and now     Foul snake and speckled adder with their young ones crawl from stone    to stone    For ruined is the house and prone the great rose-marble monolith!     Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches in the mouldering gates:    Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the fallen fluted drums.     And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced ape of Horus sits    And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars of the peristyle                                       THE god is scattered here and there: deep hidden in the windy sand    I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair.     And many a wandering caravan of stately negroes silken-shawled,    Crossing the desert, halts appalled before the neck that none can    span.     And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his yellow-striped burnous    To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was thy paladin.                                       GO, seek his fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew,    And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour!     Go, seek them where they lie alone and from their broken pieces make    Thy bruis?d bedfellow!  And wake mad passions in the senseless stone!     Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns! he loved your body! oh, be kind,    Pour spikenard on his hair, and wind soft rolls of linen round his    limbs!     Wind round his head the figured coins! stain with red fruits those    pallid lips!    Weave purple for his shrunken hips! and purple for his barren loins!                                       AWAY to Egypt!  Have no fear.  Only one God has ever died.    Only one God has let His side be wounded by a soldier's spear.     But these, thy lovers, are not dead.  Still by the hundred-cubit gate    Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies for thy head.     Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon strains his lidless eyes    Across the empty land, and cries each yellow morning unto thee.     And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black and oozy bed    And till thy coming will not spread his waters on the withering corn.     Your lovers are not dead, I know.  They will rise up and hear your    voice    And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth!  And    so,     Set wings upon your argosies!  Set horses to your ebon car!    Back to your Nile!  Or if you are grown sick of dead divinities     Follow some roving lion's spoor across the copper-coloured plain,    Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid him be your paramour!     Couch by his side upon the grass and set your white teeth in his    throat    And when you hear his dying note lash your long flanks of polished    brass     And take a tiger for your mate, whose amber sides are flecked with    black,    And ride upon his gilded back in triumph through the Theban gate,     And toy with him in amorous jests, and when he turns, and snarls, and    gnaws,    O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate    breasts!                                       WHY are you tarrying?  Get hence!  I weary of your sullen ways,    I weary of your steadfast gaze, your somnolent magnificence.     Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light flicker in the lamp,    And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful dews of night and death.     Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake,    Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances to fantastic tunes,     Your pulse makes poisonous melodies, and your black throat is like the    hole    Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic tapestries.     Away!  The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying through the Western    gate!    Away!  Or it may be too late to climb their silent silver cars!     See, the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled towers, and the rain    Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs with tears the wannish day.     What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell, with uncouth gestures and    unclean,    Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you to a student's cell?                                       WHAT songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of    the night,    And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked, and bade you enter in?     Are there not others more accursed, whiter with leprosies than I?    Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here to slake your thirst?     Get hence, you loathsome mystery!  Hideous animal, get hence!    You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me what I would not be.     You make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul dreams of sensual life,    And Atys with his blood-stained knife were better than the thing I am.     False Sphinx!  False Sphinx!  By reedy Styx old Charon, leaning on his    oar,    Waits for my coin.  Go thou before, and leave me to my crucifix,     Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches the world with wearied    eyes,    And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps for every soul in vain.  RAVENNA                                        I.     A YEAR ago I breathed the Italian air,?    And yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,?    These fields made golden with the flower of March,    The throstle singing on the feathered larch,    The cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,    The little clouds that race across the sky;    And fair the violet's gentle drooping head,    The primrose, pale for love uncomforted,    The rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,    The crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire    Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);    And all the flowers of our English Spring,    Fond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil.    Up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,    And breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;    And down the river, like a flame of blue,    Keen as an arrow flies the water-king,    While the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.    A year ago!?it seems a little time    Since last I saw that lordly southern clime,    Where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,    And like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.    Full Spring it was?and by rich flowering vines,    Dark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,    I rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,    The white road rang beneath my horse's feet,    And musing on Ravenna's ancient name,    I watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,    The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.        O how my heart with boyish passion burned,    When far away across the sedge a|2
76|"nd mere    I saw that Holy City rising clear,    Crowned with her crown of towers!?On and on    I galloped, racing with the setting sun,    And ere the crimson after-glow was passed,    I stood within Ravenna's walls at last!                                       II.        How strangely still! no sound of life or joy    Startles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy    Pipes on his reed, nor ever through the day    Comes the glad sound of children at their play:    O sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here    A man might dwell apart from troublous fear,    Watching the tide of seasons as they flow    From amorous Spring to Winter's rain and snow,    And have no thought of sorrow;?here, indeed,    Are Lethe's waters, and that fatal weed    Which makes a man forget his fatherland.        Ay! amid lotus-meadows dost thou stand,    Like Proserpine, with poppy-laden head,    Guarding the holy ashes of the dead.    For though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased,    Thy noble dead are with thee!?they at least    Are faithful to thine honour:?guard them well,    O childless city! for a mighty spell,    To wake men's hearts to dreams of things sublime,    Are the lone tombs where rest the Great of Time.                                      III.        Yon lonely pillar, rising on the plain,    Marks where the bravest knight of France was slain,?    The Prince of chivalry, the Lord of war,    Gaston de Foix: for some untimely star    Led him against thy city, and he fell,    As falls some forest-lion fighting well.    Taken from life while life and love were new,    He lies beneath God's seamless veil of blue;    Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o?er his head,    And oleanders bloom to deeper red,    Where his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground.        Look farther north unto that broken mound,?    There, prisoned now within a lordly tomb    Raised by a daughter's hand, in lonely gloom,    Huge-limbed Theodoric, the Gothic king,    Sleeps after all his weary conquering.    Time hath not spared his ruin,?wind and rain    Have broken down his stronghold; and again    We see that Death is mighty lord of all,    And king and clown to ashen dust must fall        Mighty indeed _their_ glory! yet to me    Barbaric king, or knight of chivalry,    Or the great queen herself, were poor and vain,    Beside the grave where Dante rests from pain.    His gilded shrine lies open to the air;    And cunning sculptor's hands have carven there    The calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,    The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,    The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,    The almond-face which Giotto drew so well,    The weary face of Dante;?to this day,    Here in his place of resting, far away    From Arno's yellow waters, rushing down    Through the wide bridges of that fairy town,    Where the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise    A marble lily under sapphire skies!     Alas! my Dante! thou hast known the pain    Of meaner lives,?the exile's galling chain,    How steep the stairs within kings? houses are,    And all the petty miseries which mar    Man's nobler nature with the sense of wrong.    Yet this dull world is grateful for thy song;    Our nations do thee homage,?even she,    That cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,    Who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,    Hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,    And begs in vain the ashes of her son.        O mightiest exile! all thy grief is done:    Thy soul walks now beside thy Beatrice;    Ravenna guards thine ashes: sleep in peace.                                       IV.        How lone this palace is; how grey the walls!    No minstrel now wakes echoes in these halls.    The broken chain lies rusting on the door,    And noisome weeds have split the marble floor:    Here lurks the snake, and here the lizards run    By the stone lions blinking in the sun.    Byron dwelt here in love and revelry    For two long years?a second Anthony,    Who of the world another Actium made!    Yet suffered not his royal soul to fade,    Or lyre to break, or lance to grow less keen,    ?Neath any wiles of an Egyptian queen.    For from the East there came a mighty cry,    And Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,    And called him from Ravenna: never knight    Rode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight!    None fell more bravely on ensanguined field,    Borne like a Spartan back upon his shield!    O Hellas!  Hellas! in thine hour of pride,    Thy day of might, remember him who died    To wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain:    O Salamis!  O lone Plat?an plain!    O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!    O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopyl?!    He loved you well?ay, not alone in word,    Who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,    Like 'schylos at well-fought Marathon:        And England, too, shall glory in her son,    Her warrior-poet, first in song and fight.    No longer now shall Slander's venomed spite    Crawl like a snake across his perfect name,    Or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.        For as the olive-garland of the race,    Which lights with joy each eager runner's face,    As the red cross which saveth men in war,    As a flame-bearded beacon seen from far    By mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,?    Such was his love for Greece and Liberty!        Byron, thy crowns are ever fresh and green:    Red leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene    Shall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,    In hidden glades by lonely Castaly;    The laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,    And round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.                                       V.        The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze    With the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,    And the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;?    I wandered through the wood in wild delight,    Some startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,    Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,    Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,    And small birds sang on every twining spray.    O waving trees, O forest liberty!    Within your haunts at least a man is free,    And half forgets the weary world of strife:    The blood flows hotter, and a sense of life    Wakes i? the quickening veins, while once again    The woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.    Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see    Some goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy    Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid    In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,    The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face    Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,    White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,    And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!    Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.        O idle heart!  O fond Hellenic dream!    Ere long, with melancholy rise and swell,    The evening chimes, the convent's vesper bell,    Struck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers.    Alas! alas! these sweet and honied hours    Had whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea,    And drowned all thoughts of black Gethsemane.                                       VI.        O lone Ravenna! many a tale is told    Of thy great glories in the days of old:    Two thousand years have passed since thou didst see    C'sar ride forth to royal victory.    Mighty thy name when Rome's lean eagles flew    From Britain's isles to far Euphrates blue;    And of the peoples thou wast noble queen,    Till in thy streets the Goth and Hun were seen.    Discrowned by man, deserted by the sea,    Thou sleepest, rocked in lonely misery!    No longer now upon thy swelling tide,    Pine-forest-like, thy myriad galleys ride!    For where the brass-beaked ships were wont to float,    The weary shepherd pipes his mournful note;    And the white sheep are free to come and go    Where Adria's purple waters used to flow.        O fair!  O sad!  O Queen uncomforted!    In ruined loveliness thou liest dead,    Alone of all thy sisters; for at last    Italia's royal warrior hath passed    Rome's lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown    In the high temples of the Eternal Town!    The Palatine hath welcomed back her king,    And with his name the seven mountains ring!        And Naples hath outlived her dream of pain,    And mocks her tyrant!  Venice lives again,    New risen from the waters! and the cry    Of Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,    Is heard in lordly Genoa, and where    The marble spires of Milan wound the air,    Rings from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,    And Dante's dream is now a dream no more.        But thou, Ravenna, better loved than all,    Thy ruined palaces are but a pall    That hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name    Burns like a grey and flickering candle-flame    Beneath the noonday splendour of the sun    Of new Italia! for the night is done,    The night of dark oppression, and the day    Hath dawned in passionate splendour: far away    The Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,    Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand    Girdling the plain of royal Lombardy,    From the far West unto the Eastern sea.        I know, indeed, that sons of thine have died    In Lissa's waters, by the mountain-side    Of Aspromonte, on Novara's plain,?    Nor have thy children died for thee in vain:    And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine    From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,    Thou hast not followed that immortal Star    Which leads the people forth to deeds of war.    Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,    As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,    Careless of all the hurrying hours that run,    Mourning some day of glory, for the sun    Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,    And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.        Yet wake not from thy slumbers,?rest thee well,    Amidst thy fields of amber asphodel,    Thy lily-sprinkled meadows,?rest thee there,    To mock all human greatness: who would dare    To vent the paltry sorrows of his life    Before thy ruins, or to praise the strife    Of kings? ambition, and the barren pride    Of warring nations! wert not thou the Bride    Of the wild Lord of Adria's stormy sea!    The Queen of double Empires! and to thee    Were not the nations given as thy prey!    And now?thy gates lie open night and day,    The grass grows green on every tower and hall,    The ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;    And where thy mail?d warriors stood at rest    The midnight owl hath made her secret nest.    O fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,    O city trammelled in the toils of Fate,    Doth nought remain of all thy glorious days,    But a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!        Yet who beneath this night of wars and fears,    From tranquil tower can watch the coming years;    Who can foretell what joys the day shall bring,    Or why before the dawn the linnets sing?    Thou, even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose    To crimson splendour from its grave of snows;    As the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold    From these brown lands, now stiff with Winter's cold;    As from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!        O much-loved city!  I have wandered far    From the wave-circled islands of my home;    Have seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome    Rise slowly from the drear Campagna's way,    Clothed in the royal purple of the day:    I from the city of the violet crown    Have watched the sun by Corinth's hill go down,    And marked the ?myriad laughter? of the sea    From starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;    Yet back to thee returns my perfect love,    As to its forest-nest the evening dove.        O poet's city! one who scarce has seen    Some twenty summers cast their doublets green    For Autumn's livery, would seek in vain    To wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,    Or tell thy days of glory;?poor indeed    Is the low murmur of the shepherd's reed,    Where the loud clarion's blast should shake the sky,    And flame across the heavens! and to try    Such lofty themes were folly: yet I know    That never felt my heart a nobler glow    Than when I woke the silence of thy street    With clamorous trampling of my horse's feet,    And saw the city which now I try to sing,    After long days of weary travelling.                                      VII.        Adieu, Ravenna! but a year ago,    I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow    From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:    The sky was as a shield that caught the stain    Of blood and battle from the dying sun,    And in the west the circling clouds had spun    A royal robe, which some great God might wear,    While into ocean-seas of purple air    Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.        Yet here the gentle stillness of the night    Brings back the swelling tide of memory,    And wakes again my passionate love for thee:    Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come    On meadow and tree the Summer's lordly bloom;    And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,    And send up lilies for some boy to mow.    Then before long the Summer's conqueror,    Rich Autumn-time, the season's usurer,    Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,    And see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;    And after that the Winter cold and drear.    So runs the perfect cycle of the year.    And so from youth to manhood do we go,    And fall to weary days and locks of snow.    Love only knows no winter; never dies:    Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies    And mine for thee shall never pass away,    Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.        Adieu!  Adieu! yon silent evening star,    The night's ambassador, doth gleam afar,    And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.    Perchance before our inland seas of gold    Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,    Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,    I may behold thy city; and lay down    Low at thy feet the poet's laurel crown.        Adieu!  Adieu! yon silver lamp, the moon,    Which turns our midnight into perfect noon,    Doth surely light thy towers, guarding well    Where Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell.  SOME CRUELTIES OF PRISON LIFE.                      THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY CHRONICLE.  SIR,--I learn with great regret, through an extract from the columns of your paper, that the warder Martin, of Reading Prison, has been dismissed by the Prison Commissioners for having given some sweet biscuits to a little hungry child. I saw the three children myself on the Monday preceding my release. They had just been convicted, and were standing in a row in the central hall in their prison dress, carrying their sheets under the arms previous to their being sent to the cells allotted to them. I happened to be passing along one of the galleries on my way to the reception room, where I was to have an interview with a friend. They were quite small children, the youngest--the one to whom the warder gave the biscuits--being a tiny little chap, for whom they had evidently been unable to find clothes small enough to fit. I had, of course, seen many children in prison during the two years during which I was myself confined. Wandsworth Prison, especially, contained always a large number of children. But the little child I saw on the afternoon of Monday, the 17th, at Reading, was tinier than any one of them. I need not say how utterly distressed I was to see these children at Reading, for I knew the treatment in store for them. The cruelty that is practised by day and night on children in English prisons is incredible, except to those who have witnessed it and are aware of the brutality of the system.  People nowadays do not understand what cruelty is. They regard it as a sort of terrible medi?val passion, and connect it with the race of men like Eccelin da Romano, and others, to whom the deliberate infliction of pain gave a real madness of pleasure. But men of the stamp of Eccelin are merely abnormal types of perverted individualism. Ordinary cruelty is simply stupidity. It comes from the entire want of imagination. It is the result in our days of stereotyped systems, of hard-and-fast rules, of centralisation, of officialism, and of irresponsible authority. Wherever there is centralisation there is stupidity. What is inhuman in modern life is officialism. Authority is as destructive to those who exercise it as it is to those on whom it is exercised. It is the Prison Board, with the system that it carries out, that is the primary source of the cruelty that is exercised on a child in prison. The people who uphold the system have excellent intentions. Those who carry it out are humane in intention also. Responsibility is shifted on to the disciplinary regulations. It is supposed that because a thing is the rule it is right.  The present treatment of children is terrible, primarily from people not understanding the peculiar psychology of a child's nature. A child can understand a punishment inflicted by an individual, such as a parent or guardian, and bear it with a certain amount of acquiescence. What it cannot understand is a punishment inflicted by Society. It cannot realise what Society is. With grown people it is, of course, the reverse. Those of us who are either in prison or have been sent there, can understand, and do understand, what that collective force called Society means, and whatever we may think of its methods or claims, we can force ourselves to accept it. Punishment inflicted on us by an individual, on the other hand, is a thing that no grown person endures or is expected to endure.  The child consequently, being taken away from its parents by people whom it has never seen, and of whom it knows nothing, and finding itself in a lonely and unfamiliar cell, waited on by strange faces, and ordered about and punished by the representatives of a system that it cannot understand, becomes an immediate prey to the first and most prominent emotion produced by modern prison life--the emotion of terror. The terror of a child in prison is quite limitless. I remember once in Reading, as I was going out to exercise, seeing in the dimly-lit cell, right opposite my own, a small boy. Two warders, not unkindly men, were talking to him, with some sternness apparently, or perhaps giving him some useful advice about his conduct. One was in the cell with him, the other was standing outside. The child's face was like a white wedge of sheer terror. There was in his eyes the mute appeal of a hunted animal. The next morning I heard him at breakfast-time crying, and calling to be let out. His cry was for his parents. From time to time I could hear the deep voice of the warder on duty warning him to keep quiet. Yet he was not even convicted of whatever little offence he had been charged with. He was simply on remand. That I knew by his wearing his own clothes, which seemed neat enough. He was, however, wearing prison socks and shoes. This showed that he was a very poor boy, whose own shoes, if he had any, were in a bad state. Justices and magistrates, an entirely ignorant class as a rule, often remand children for a week, and then perhaps remit whatever sentence they are entitled to pass. They call this ""not sending a child to prison."" It is, of course, a stupid view on their part. To a little child, whether he is in prison on remand or after conviction, is a subtlety of social position he cannot comprehend. To him the horrible thing is to be there at all. In the eyes of humanity it should be a horrible thing for him to be there at all.  This terror that seizes and dominates the child, as it seizes the grown man also, is of course intensified beyond power of expression by the solitary cellular system of our prisons. Every child is confined to its cell for twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four. This is the appalling thing. To shut up a child in a dimly-lit cell for twenty-three hours out of the twenty-four is an example of the cruelty of stupidity. If an individual, parent or guardian, did this to a child he would be severely punished. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children would take the matter up at once. There would be on all hands the utmost detestation of whomsoever had been guilty of such cruelty. A heavy sentence would undoubtedly follow conviction. But our own actual society does worse itself, and to the child to be so treated by a strange abstract force, of whose claims it has no cognizance, is much worse than it would be to receive the same treatment from its father or mother, or someone it knew. The inhuman treatment of a child is always inhuman, by whomsoever it is inflicted. But inhuman treatment by Society is to the child the more terrible because there is no appeal. A parent or guardian can be moved, and let out the child from the dark lonely room in which it is confined. But a warder cannot. Most warders are very fond of children. But the system prohibits them from rendering the child any assistance. Should they do so, as Warder Martin did, they are dismissed.  The second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger. The food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually badly-baked prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven. At twelve o'clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of coarse Indian meal stirabout, and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin of water for its supper. This diet in the case of a strong grown man is always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness. In fact in a big prison astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter of course. In the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of eating the food at all. Anyone who knows anything about children knows how easily a child's digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble and mental distress of any kind. A child who has been crying all day long, and perhaps half the night, in a lonely dimly-lit cell, and is preyed upon by terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible kind. In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the biscuits, the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning, and utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its breakfast. Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving. It was a beautiful action on his part, and was so recognised by the child, who, utterly unconscious of the regulation of the Prison Board, told one of the senior warders how kind this junior warder had been to him. The result was, of course, a report and a dismissal.  I know Martin extremely well, and I was under his charge for the last seven weeks of my imprisonment. On his appointment at Reading he had charge of Gallery C, in which I was confined, so I saw him constantly. I was struck by the singular kindness and humanity of the way in which he spoke to me and to the other prisoners. Kind words are much in prison, and a pleasant ""Good morning"" or ""Good evening"" will make one as happy as one can be in solitary confinement. He was always gentle and considerate. I happen to know another case in which he showed great kindness to one of the prisoners, and I have no hesitation in mentioning it. One of the most horrible things in prison is the badness of the sanitary arrangements. No prisoner is allowed under any circumstances to leave his cell after half-past five p.m. If, consequently, he is suffering from diarrhoea, he has to use his cell as a latrine, and pass the night in a most fetid and unwholesome atmosphere. Some days before my release Martin was going the rounds at half-past seven with one of the senior warders for the purpose of collecting the oakum and tools of the prisoners. A man just convicted, and suffering from violent diarrhoea in consequence of the food, as is always the case, asked this senior warder to allow him to empty the slops in his cell on account of the horrible odour of the cell and the possibility of illness again in the night. The senior warder refused absolutely; it was against the rules. The man, as far as he was concerned, had to pass the night in this dreadful condition. Martin, however, rather than see this wretched man in such a loathsome predicament, said he would empty the man's slops himself, and did so. A warder emptying a prisoner's slops is, of course, against the rules, but Martin did this act of kindness to the man out of the simple humanity of his nature, and the man was naturally most grateful.  As regards the children, a great deal has been talked and written lately about the contaminating influence of prison on young children. What is said is quite true. A child is utterly contaminated by prison life. But the contaminating influence is not that of the prisoners. It is that of the whole prison system--of the governor, the chaplain, the warders, the lonely cell, the isolation, the revolting food, the rules of the Prison Commissioners, the mode of discipline as it is termed, of the life. Every care is taken to isolate a child from the sight even of all prisoners over sixteen years of age. Children sit behind a curtain in chapel, and are sent to take exercise in small sunless yards--sometimes a stone-yard, sometimes a yard at the back of the mills--rather than that they should see the elder prisoners at exercise. But the only really humanising influence in prison is the influence of the prisoners. Their cheerfulness under terrible circumstances, their sympathy for each other, their humility, their gentleness, their pleasant smiles of greeting when they meet each other, their complete acquiescence in their punishments, are all quite wonderful, and I myself learnt many sound lessons from them. I am not proposing that the children should not sit behind a curtain in chapel, or that they should take exercise in a corner of the common yard. I am merely pointing out that the bad influence on children is not, and could never be, that of the prisoners, but is, and will always remain, that of the prison system itself. There is not a single man in Reading Gaol that would not gladly have done the three children's punishment for them. When I saw them last it was on the Tuesday following their conviction. I was taking exercise at half-past eleven with about twelve other men, as the three children passed near us, in charge of a warder, from the damp, dreary stone-yard in which they had been at their exercise. I saw the greatest pity and sympathy in the eyes of my companions as they looked at them. Prisoners are, as a class, extremely kind and sympathetic to each other. Suffering and the community of suffering makes people kind, and day after day as I tramped the yard I used to feel with pleasure and comfort what Carlyle calls somewhere ""the silent rhythmic charm of human companionship."" In this as in all other things, philanthropists and people of that kind are astray. It is not the prisoners who need reformation. It is the prisons.  Of course no child under fourteen years of age should be sent to prison at all. It is an absurdity, and, like many absurdities, of absolutely tragic results. If, however, they are to be sent to prison, during the daytime they should be in a workshop or schoolroom with a warder. At night they should sleep in a dormitory, with a night-warder to look after them. They should be allowed exercise for at least three hours a day. The dark, badly-ventilated, ill-smelling prison cells are dreadful for a child, dreadful indeed for anyone. One is always breathing bad air in prison. The food given to children should consist of tea and bread-and-butter and soup. Prison soup is very good and wholesome. A resolution of the House of Commons could settle the treatment of children in half an hour. I hope you will use your influence to have this done. The way that children are treated at present is really an outrage on humanity and common-sense. It comes from stupidity.  Let me draw attention now to another terrible thing that goes on in English prisons, indeed in prisons all over the world where the system of silence and cellular confinement is practised. I refer to the large number of men who become insane or weak-minded in prison. In convict prisons this is, of course, quite common; but in ordinary gaols also, such as that I was confined in, it is to be found.  About three months ago, I noticed amongst the prisoners who took exercise with me a young man who "|2
77|seemed to me to be silly or half-witted. Every prison of course has its half-witted clients, who return again and again, and may be said to live in the prison. But this young man struck me as being more than usually half-witted on account of his silly grin and idiotic laughter to himself, and the peculiar restlessness of his eternally twitching hands. He was noticed by all the other prisoners on account of the strangeness of his conduct. From time to time he did not appear at exercise, which showed me that he was being punished by confinement to his cell. Finally, I discovered that he was under observation, and being watched night and day by warders. When he did appear at exercise, he always seemed hysterical, and used to walk round crying or laughing. At chapel he had to sit right under the observation of two warders, who carefully watched him all the time. Sometimes he would bury his head in his hands, an offence against the chapel regulations, and his head would be immediately struck up by a warder, so that he should keep his eyes fixed permanently in the direction of the Communion-table. Sometimes he would cry--not making any disturbance--but with tears streaming down his face and a hysterical throbbing in the throat. Sometimes he would grin idiot-like to himself and make faces. He was on more than one occasion sent out of chapel to his cell, and of course he was continually punished. As the bench on which I used to sit in chapel was directly behind the bench at the end of which this unfortunate man was placed, I had full opportunity of observing him. I also saw him, of course, at exercise continually, and I saw that he was becoming insane, and was being treated as if he was shamming.  On Saturday week last, I was in my cell at about one o'clock occupied in cleaning and polishing the tins I had been using for dinner. Suddenly I was startled by the prison silence being broken by the most horrible and revolting shrieks or rather howls, for at first I thought some animal like a bull or a cow was being unskilfully slaughtered outside the prison walls. I soon realised, however, that the howls proceeded from the basement of the prison, and I knew that some wretched man was being flogged. I need not say how hideous and terrible it was for me, and I began to wonder who it was who was being punished in this revolting manner. Suddenly it dawned upon me that they might be flogging this unfortunate lunatic. My feelings on the subject need not be chronicled; they have nothing to do with the question.  The next day, Sunday 16th, I saw the poor fellow at exercise, his weak, ugly, wretched face bloated by tears and hysteria almost beyond recognition. He walked in the centre ring along with the old men, the beggars and the lame people, so that I was able to observe him the whole time. It was my last Sunday in prison, a perfectly lovely day, the finest day we had had the whole year, and there, in the beautiful sunlight, walked this poor creature--made once in the image of God--grinning like an ape, and making with his hands the most fantastic gestures, as though he was playing in the air on some invisible stringed instrument, or arranging and dealing counters in some curious game. All the while these hysterical tears, without which none of us ever saw him, were making soiled runnels on his white swollen face. The hideous and deliberate grace of his gestures made him like an antic. He was a living grotesque. The other prisoners all watched him, and not one of them smiled. Everybody knew what had happened to him, and that he was being driven insane--was insane already. After half-an-hour, he was ordered in by the warder, and, I suppose, punished. At least he was not at exercise on Monday, though I think I caught sight of him at the corner of the stone-yard, walking in charge of a warder.  On the Tuesday--my last day in prison--I saw him at exercise. He was worse than before, and again was sent in. Since then I know nothing of him, but I found out from one of the prisoners who walked with me at exercise that he had had twenty-four lashes in the cook-house on Saturday afternoon, by order of the visiting justices on the report of the doctor. The howls that had horrified us all were his.  This man is undoubtedly becoming insane. Prison doctors have no knowledge of mental disease of any kind. They are as a class ignorant men. The pathology of the mind is unknown to them. When a man grows insane, they treat him as shamming. They have him punished again and again. Naturally the man becomes worse. When ordinary punishments are exhausted, the doctor reports the case to the justices. The result is flogging. Of course the flogging is not done with a cat-of-nine-tails. It is what is called birching. The instrument is a rod; but the result on the wretched half-witted man may be imagined.  His number is, or was, A. 2. 11. I also managed to find out his name. It is Prince. Something should be done at once for him. He is a soldier, and his sentence is one of court-martial. The term is six months. Three have yet to run.  May I ask you to use your influence to have this case examined into, and to see that the lunatic prisoner is properly treated?  No report by the Medical Commissioners is of any avail. It is not to be trusted. The medical inspectors do not seem to understand the difference between idiocy and lunacy--between the entire absence of a function or organ and the diseases of a function or organ. This man A. 2. 11, will, I have no doubt, be able to tell his name, the nature of his offence, the day of the month, the date of the beginning and expiration of his sentence, and answer any ordinary simple question; but that his mind is diseased admits of no doubt. At present it is a horrible duel between himself and the doctor. The doctor is fighting for a theory. The man is fighting for his life. I am anxious that the man should win. But let the whole case be examined into by experts who understand brain-disease, and by people of humane feelings who have still some common-sense and some pity. There is no reason that the sentimentalist should be asked to interfere. He always does harm. He culminates at his starting point. His end, as his origin, is an emotion.  The case is a special instance of the cruelty inseparable from a stupid system, for the present Governor of Reading is a man of gentle and humane character, greatly liked and respected by all the prisoners. He was appointed in July last, and though he cannot alter the rules of the prison system, he has altered the spirit in which they used to be carried out under his predecessor. He is very popular with the prisoners and with the warders. Indeed he has quite elevated the whole tone of the prison-life. Upon the other hand, the system is of course beyond his reach as far as altering its rules is concerned. I have no doubt that he sees daily much of what he knows to be unjust, stupid, and cruel. But his hands are tied. Of course I have no knowledge of his real views of the case of A. 2. 11, nor, indeed, of any of his views on our present system. I merely judge him by the complete change he brought about in Reading Prison. Under his predecessor the system was carried out with the greatest harshness and stupidity.--I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,    DE PROFUNDIS   . . . Suffering is one very long moment.  We cannot divide it by seasons. We can only record its moods, and chronicle their return.  With us time itself does not progress.  It revolves.  It seems to circle round one centre of pain.  The paralysing immobility of a life every circumstance of which is regulated after an unchangeable pattern, so that we eat and drink and lie down and pray, or kneel at least for prayer, according to the inflexible laws of an iron formula: this immobile quality, that makes each dreadful day in the very minutest detail like its brother, seems to communicate itself to those external forces the very essence of whose existence is ceaseless change.  Of seed-time or harvest, of the reapers bending over the corn, or the grape gatherers threading through the vines, of the grass in the orchard made white with broken blossoms or strewn with fallen fruit: of these we know nothing and can know nothing.  For us there is only one season, the season of sorrow.  The very sun and moon seem taken from us.  Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the light that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small iron-barred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard.  It is always twilight in one's cell, as it is always twilight in one's heart. And in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more.  The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or can easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to- morrow.  Remember this, and you will be able to understand a little of why I am writing, and in this manner writing. . . .  A week later, I am transferred here.  Three more months go over and my mother dies.  No one knew how deeply I loved and honoured her.  Her death was terrible to me; but I, once a lord of language, have no words in which to express my anguish and my shame.  She and my father had bequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured, not merely in literature, art, archaeology, and science, but in the public history of my own country, in its evolution as a nation.  I had disgraced that name eternally.  I had made it a low by-word among low people.  I had dragged it through the very mire.  I had given it to brutes that they might make it brutal, and to fools that they might turn it into a synonym for folly. What I suffered then, and still suffer, is not for pen to write or paper to record.  My wife, always kind and gentle to me, rather than that I should hear the news from indifferent lips, travelled, ill as she was, all the way from Genoa to England to break to me herself the tidings of so irreparable, so irremediable, a loss.  Messages of sympathy reached me from all who had still affection for me.  Even people who had not known me personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote to ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me. . . .  Three months go over.  The calendar of my daily conduct and labour that hangs on the outside of my cell door, with my name and sentence written upon it, tells me that it is May. . . .  Prosperity, pleasure and success, may be rough of grain and common in fibre, but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things.  There is nothing that stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation.  The thin beaten-out leaf of tremulous gold that chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see is in comparison coarse.  It is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it, and even then must bleed again, though not in pain.  Where there is sorrow there is holy ground.  Some day people will realise what that means.  They will know nothing of life till they do,--and natures like his can realise it.  When I was brought down from my prison to the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,--waited in the long dreary corridor that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by.  Men have gone to heaven for smaller things than that.  It was in this spirit, and with this mode of love, that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor, or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek.  I have never said one single word to him about what he did.  I do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action.  It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.  I store it in the treasure-house of my heart.  I keep it there as a secret debt that I am glad to think I can never possibly repay.  It is embalmed and kept sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears.  When wisdom has been profitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded, broken, and great heart of the world.  When people are able to understand, not merely how beautiful ---'s action was, but why it meant so much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me. . . .  The poor are wise, more charitable, more kind, more sensitive than we are.  In their eyes prison is a tragedy in a man's life, a misfortune, a casuality, something that calls for sympathy in others.  They speak of one who is in prison as of one who is 'in trouble' simply.  It is the phrase they always use, and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love in it.  With people of our own rank it is different.  With us, prison makes a man a pariah.  I, and such as I am, have hardly any right to air and sun.  Our presence taints the pleasures of others.  We are unwelcome when we reappear.  To revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us.  Our very children are taken away.  Those lovely links with humanity are broken.  We are doomed to be solitary, while our sons still live.  We are denied the one thing that might heal us and keep us, that might bring balm to the bruised heart, and peace to the soul in pain. . . .  I must say to myself that I ruined myself, and that nobody great or small can be ruined except by his own hand.  I am quite ready to say so.  I am trying to say so, though they may not think it at the present moment. This pitiless indictment I bring without pity against myself.  Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still.  I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.  I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and had forced my age to realise it afterwards.  Few men hold such a position in their own lifetime, and have it so acknowledged.  It is usually discerned, if discerned at all, by the historian, or the critic, long after both the man and his age have passed away.  With me it was different.  I felt it myself, and made others feel it.  Byron was a symbolic figure, but his relations were to the passion of his age and its weariness of passion.  Mine were to something more noble, more permanent, of more vital issue, of larger scope.  The gods had given me almost everything.  But I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease.  I amused myself with being a _flaneur_, a dandy, a man of fashion.  I surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds.  I became the spendthrift of my own genius, and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy.  Tired of being on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation.  What the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought, perversity became to me in the sphere of passion.  Desire, at the end, was a malady, or a madness, or both.  I grew careless of the lives of others.  I took pleasure where it pleased me, and passed on.  I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has some day to cry aloud on the housetop.  I ceased to be lord over myself.  I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it.  I allowed pleasure to dominate me.  I ended in horrible disgrace.  There is only one thing for me now, absolute humility.  I have lain in prison for nearly two years.  Out of my nature has come wild despair; an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at; terrible and impotent rage; bitterness and scorn; anguish that wept aloud; misery that could find no voice; sorrow that was dumb.  I have passed through every possible mood of suffering.  Better than Wordsworth himself I know what Wordsworth meant when he said--  But while there were times when I rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings were to be endless, I could not bear them to be without meaning.  Now I find hidden somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that nothing in the whole world is meaningless, and suffering least of all. That something hidden away in my nature, like a treasure in a field, is Humility.  It is the last thing left in me, and the best: the ultimate discovery at which I have arrived, the starting-point for a fresh development.  It has come to me right out of myself, so I know that it has come at the proper time.  It could not have come before, nor later.  Had any one told me of it, I would have rejected it.  Had it been brought to me, I would have refused it.  As I found it, I want to keep it.  I must do so.  It is the one thing that has in it the elements of life, of a new life, _Vita Nuova_ for me.  Of all things it is the strangest.  One cannot acquire it, except by surrendering everything that one has.  It is only when one has lost all things, that one knows that one possesses it.  Now I have realised that it is in me, I see quite clearly what I ought to do; in fact, must do.  And when I use such a phrase as that, I need not say that I am not alluding to any external sanction or command.  I admit none.  I am far more of an individualist than I ever was.  Nothing seems to me of the smallest value except what one gets out of oneself.  My nature is seeking a fresh mode of self-realisation.  That is all I am concerned with.  And the first thing that I have got to do is to free myself from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world.  I am completely penniless, and absolutely homeless.  Yet there are worse things in the world than that.  I am quite candid when I say that rather than go out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the world, I would gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door.  If I got nothing from the house of the rich I would get something at the house of the poor.  Those who have much are often greedy; those who have little always share.  I would not a bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in summer, and when winter came on sheltering myself by the warm close-thatched rick, or under the penthouse of a great barn, provided I had love in my heart.  The external things of life seem to me now of no importance at all.  You can see to what intensity of individualism I have arrived--or am arriving rather, for the journey is long, and 'where I walk there are thorns.'  Of course I know that to ask alms on the highway is not to be my lot, and that if ever I lie in the cool grass at night-time it will be to write sonnets to the moon.  When I go out of prison, R--- will be waiting for me on the other side of the big iron-studded gate, and he is the symbol, not merely of his own affection, but of the affection of many others besides.  I believe I am to have enough to live on for about eighteen months at any rate, so that if I may not write beautiful books, I may at least read beautiful books; and what joy can be greater?  After that, I hope to be able to recreate my creative faculty.  But were things different: had I not a friend left in the world; were there not a single house open to me in pity; had I to accept the wallet and ragged cloak of sheer penury: as long as I am free from all resentment, hardness and scorn, I would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than I would were my body in purple and fine linen, and the soul within me sick with hate.  And I really shall have no difficulty.  When you really want love you will find it waiting for you.  I need not say that my task does not end there.  It would be comparatively easy if it did.  There is much more before me.  I have hills far steeper to climb, valleys much darker to pass through.  And I have to get it all out of myself.  Neither religion, morality, nor reason can help me at all.  Morality does not help me.  I am a born antinomian.  I am one of those who are made for exceptions, not for laws.  But while I see that there is nothing wrong in what one does, I see that there is something wrong in what one becomes.  It is well to have learned that.  Religion does not help me.  The faith that others give to what is unseen, I give to what one can touch, and look at.  My gods dwell in temples made with hands; and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made perfect and complete: too complete, it may be, for like many or all of those who have placed their heaven in this earth, I have found in it not merely the beauty of heaven, but the horror of hell also.  When I think about religion at all, I feel as if I would like to found an order for those who _cannot_ believe: the Confraternity of the Faithless, one might call it, where on an altar, on which no taper burned, a priest, in whose heart peace had no dwelling, might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine.  Every thing to be true must become a religion. And agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith.  It has sown its martyrs, it should reap its saints, and praise God daily for having hidden Himself from man.  But whether it be faith or agnosticism, it must be nothing external to me.  Its symbols must be of my own creating.  Only that is spiritual which makes its own form.  If I may not find its secret within myself, I shall never find it: if I have not got it already, it will never come to me.  Reason does not help me.  It tells me that the laws under which I am convicted are wrong and unjust laws, and the system under which I have suffered a wrong and unjust system.  But, somehow, I have got to make both of these things just and right to me.  And exactly as in Art one is only concerned with what a particular thing is at a particular moment to oneself, so it is also in the ethical evolution of one's character.  I have got to make everything that has happened to me good for me.  The plank bed, the loathsome food, the hard ropes shredded into oakum till one's finger-tips grow dull with pain, the menial offices with which each day begins and finishes, the harsh orders that routine seems to necessitate, the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to look at, the silence, the solitude, the shame--each and all of these things I have to transform into a spiritual experience.  There is not a single degradation of the body which I must not try and make into a spiritualising of the soul.  I want to get to the point when I shall be able to say quite simply, and without affectation that the two great turning-points in my life were when my father sent me to Oxford, and when society sent me to prison.  I will not say that prison is the best thing that could have happened to me: for that phrase would savour of too great bitterness towards myself. I would sooner say, or hear it said of me, that I was so typical a child of my age, that in my perversity, and for that perversity's sake, I turned the good things of my life to evil, and the evil things of my life to good.  What is said, however, by myself or by others, matters little.  The important thing, the thing that lies before me, the thing that I have to do, if the brief remainder of my days is not to be maimed, marred, and incomplete, is to absorb into my nature all that has been done to me, to make it part of me, to accept it without complaint, fear, or reluctance. The supreme vice is shallowness.  Whatever is realised is right.  When first I was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who I was.  It was ruinous advice.  It is only by realising what I am that I have found comfort of any kind.  Now I am advised by others to try on my release to forget that I have ever been in a prison at all.  I know that would be equally fatal.  It would mean that I would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace, and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody else--the beauty of the sun and moon, the pageant of the seasons, the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights, the rain falling through the leaves, or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silver--would all be tainted for me, and lose their healing power, and their power of communicating joy.  To regret one's own experiences is to arrest one's own development.  To deny one's own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of one's own life.  It is no less than a denial of the soul.  For just as the body absorbs things of all kinds, things common and unclean no less than those that the priest or a vision has cleansed, and converts them into swiftness or strength, into the play of beautiful muscles and the moulding of fair flesh, into the curves and colours of the hair, the lips, the eye; so the soul in its turn has its nutritive functions also, and can transform into noble moods of thought and passions of high import what in itself is base, cruel and degrading; nay, more, may find in these its most august modes of assertion, and can often reveal itself most perfectly through what was intended to desecrate or destroy.  The fact of my having been the common prisoner of a common gaol I must frankly accept, and, curious as it may seem, one of the things I shall have to teach myself is not to be ashamed of it.  I must accept it as a punishment, and if one is ashamed of having been punished, one might just as well never have been punished at all.  Of course there are many things of which I was convicted that I had not done, but then there are many things of which I was convicted that I had done, and a still greater number of things in my life for which I was never indicted at all.  And as the gods are strange, and punish us for what is good and humane in us as much as for what is evil and perverse, I must accept the fact that one is punished for the good as well as for the evil that one does.  I have no doubt that it is quite right one should be.  It helps one, or should help one, to realise both, and not to be too conceited about either.  And if I then am not ashamed of my punishment, as I hope not to be, I shall be able to think, and walk, and live with freedom.  Many men on their release carry their prison about with them into the air, and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts, and at length, like poor poisoned things, creep into some hole and die.  It is wretched that they should have to do so, and it is wrong, terribly wrong, of society that it should force them to do so.  Society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual, but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness, and fails to realise what it has done.  When the man's punishment is over, it leaves him to himself; that is to say, it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty towards him begins.  It is really ashamed of its own actions, and shuns those whom it has punished, as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay, or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable, an irremediable wrong.  I can claim on my side that if I realise what I have suffered, society should realise what it has inflicted on me; and that there should be no bitterness or hate on either side.  Of course I know that from one point of view things will be made different for me than for others; must indeed, by the very nature of the case, be made so.  The poor thieves and outcasts who are imprisoned here with me are in many respects more fortunate than I am.  The little way in grey city or green field that saw their sin is small; to find those who know nothing of what they have done they need go no further than a bird might fly between the twilight and the dawn; but for me the world is shrivelled to a handsbreadth, and everywhere I turn my name is written on the rocks in lead.  For I have come, not from obscurity into the momentary notoriety of crime, but from a sort of eternity of fame to a sort of eternity of infamy, and sometimes seem to myself to have shown, if indeed it required showing, that between the famous and the infamous there is but one step, if as much as one.  Still, in the very fact that people will recognise me wherever I go, and know all about my life, as far as its follies go, I can discern something good for me.  It will force on me the necessity of again asserting myself a|2
78|s an artist, and as soon as I possibly can.  If I can produce only one beautiful work of art I shall be able to rob malice of its venom, and cowardice of its sneer, and to pluck out the tongue of scorn by the roots.  And if life be, as it surely is, a problem to me, I am no less a problem to life.  People must adopt some attitude towards me, and so pass judgment, both on themselves and me.  I need not say I am not talking of particular individuals.  The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.  Nor am I making any demands on life.  In all that I have said I am simply concerned with my own mental attitude towards life as a whole; and I feel that not to be ashamed of having been punished is one of the first points I must attain to, for the sake of my own perfection, and because I am so imperfect.  Then I must learn how to be happy.  Once I knew it, or thought I knew it, by instinct.  It was always springtime once in my heart.  My temperament was akin to joy.  I filled my life to the very brim with pleasure, as one might fill a cup to the very brim with wine.  Now I am approaching life from a completely new standpoint, and even to conceive happiness is often extremely difficult for me.  I remember during my first term at Oxford reading in Pater's _Renaissance_--that book which has had such strange influence over my life--how Dante places low in the Inferno those who wilfully live in sadness; and going to the college library and turning to the passage in the _Divine Comedy_ where beneath the dreary marsh lie those who were 'sullen in the sweet air,' saying for ever and ever through their sighs--  I knew the church condemned _accidia_, but the whole idea seemed to me quite fantastic, just the sort of sin, I fancied, a priest who knew nothing about real life would invent.  Nor could I understand how Dante, who says that 'sorrow remarries us to God,' could have been so harsh to those who were enamoured of melancholy, if any such there really were.  I had no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest temptations of my life.  While I was in Wandsworth prison I longed to die.  It was my one desire. When after two months in the infirmary I was transferred here, and found myself growing gradually better in physical health, I was filled with rage.  I determined to commit suicide on the very day on which I left prison.  After a time that evil mood passed away, and I made up my mind to live, but to wear gloom as a king wears purple: never to smile again: to turn whatever house I entered into a house of mourning: to make my friends walk slowly in sadness with me: to teach them that melancholy is the true secret of life: to maim them with an alien sorrow: to mar them with my own pain.  Now I feel quite differently.  I see it would be both ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends came to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order to show their sympathy; or, if I desired to entertain them, to invite them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats.  I must learn how to be cheerful and happy.  The last two occasions on which I was allowed to see my friends here, I tried to be as cheerful as possible, and to show my cheerfulness, in order to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the way from town to see me.  It is only a slight return, I know, but it is the one, I feel certain, that pleases them most.  I saw R--- for an hour on Saturday week, and I tried to give the fullest possible expression of the delight I really felt at our meeting.  And that, in the views and ideas I am here shaping for myself, I am quite right is shown to me by the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment I have a real desire for life.  There is before me so much to do, that I would regard it as a terrible tragedy if I died before I was allowed to complete at any rate a little of it.  I see new developments in art and life, each one of which is a fresh mode of perfection.  I long to live so that I can explore what is no less than a new world to me.  Do you want to know what this new world is?  I think you can guess what it is.  It is the world in which I have been living.  Sorrow, then, and all that it teaches one, is my new world.  I used to live entirely for pleasure.  I shunned suffering and sorrow of every kind.  I hated both.  I resolved to ignore them as far as possible: to treat them, that is to say, as modes of imperfection.  They were not part of my scheme of life.  They had no place in my philosophy.  My mother, who knew life as a whole, used often to quote to me Goethe's lines--written by Carlyle in a book he had given her years ago, and translated by him, I fancy, also:--  They were the lines which that noble Queen of Prussia, whom Napoleon treated with such coarse brutality, used to quote in her humiliation and exile; they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her later life.  I absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden in them.  I could not understand it.  I remember quite well how I used to tell her that I did not want to eat my bread in sorrow, or to pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn.  I had no idea that it was one of the special things that the Fates had in store for me: that for a whole year of my life, indeed, I was to do little else.  But so has my portion been meted out to me; and during the last few months I have, after terrible difficulties and struggles, been able to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain. Clergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of suffering as a mystery.  It is really a revelation.  One discerns things one never discerned before.  One approaches the whole of history from a different standpoint.  What one had felt dimly, through instinct, about art, is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of vision and absolute intensity of apprehension.  I now see that sorrow, being the supreme emotion of which man is capable, is at once the type and test of all great art.  What the artist is always looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible: in which the outward is expressive of the inward: in which form reveals.  Of such modes of existence there are not a few: youth and the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment: at another we may like to think that, in its subtlety and sensitiveness of impression, its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and making its raiment of earth and air, of mist and city alike, and in its morbid sympathy of its moods, and tones, and colours, modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic perfection by the Greeks.  Music, in which all subject is absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it, is a complex example, and a flower or a child a simple example, of what I mean; but sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art.  Behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament, coarse, hard and callous.  But behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  Pain, unlike pleasure, wears no mask.  Truth in art is not any correspondence between the essential idea and the accidental existence; it is not the resemblance of shape to shadow, or of the form mirrored in the crystal to the form itself; it is no echo coming from a hollow hill, any more than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the moon and Narcissus to Narcissus.  Truth in art is the unity of a thing with itself: the outward rendered expressive of the inward: the soul made incarnate: the body instinct with spirit.  For this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow.  There are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth.  Other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite, made to blind the one and cloy the other, but out of sorrow have the worlds been built, and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain.  More than this, there is about sorrow an intense, an extraordinary reality.  I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age.  There is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life.  For the secret of life is suffering.  It is what is hidden behind everything.  When we begin to live, what is sweet is so sweet to us, and what is bitter so bitter, that we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures, and seek not merely for a 'month or twain to feed on honeycomb,' but for all our years to taste no other food, ignorant all the while that we may really be starving the soul.  I remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful personalities I have ever known: a woman, whose sympathy and noble kindness to me, both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment, have been beyond power and description; one who has really assisted me, though she does not know it, to bear the burden of my troubles more than any one else in the whole world has, and all through the mere fact of her existence, through her being what she is--partly an ideal and partly an influence: a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help towards becoming it; a soul that renders the common air sweet, and makes what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea: one for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand, and have the same message. On the occasion of which I am thinking I recall distinctly how I said to her that there was enough suffering in one narrow London lane to show that God did not love man, and that wherever there was any sorrow, though but that of a child, in some little garden weeping over a fault that it had or had not committed, the whole face of creation was completely marred.  I was entirely wrong.  She told me so, but I could not believe her.  I was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to. Now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world.  I cannot conceive of any other explanation.  I am convinced that there is no other, and that if the world has indeed, as I have said, been built of sorrow, it has been built by the hands of love, because in no other way could the soul of man, for whom the world was made, reach the full stature of its perfection.  Pleasure for the beautiful body, but pain for the beautiful soul.  When I say that I am convinced of these things I speak with too much pride.  Far off, like a perfect pearl, one can see the city of God.  It is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summer's day.  And so a child could.  But with me and such as me it is different. One can realise a thing in a single moment, but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet.  It is so difficult to keep 'heights that the soul is competent to gain.'  We think in eternity, but we move slowly through time; and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison I need not tell again, nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into one's cell, and into the cell of one's heart, with such strange insistence that one has, as it were, to garnish and sweep one's house for their coming, as for an unwelcome guest, or a bitter master, or a slave whose slave it is one's chance or choice to be.  And, though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe, it is true none the less, that for them living in freedom and idleness and comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for me, who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of my cell.  For prison life with its endless privations and restrictions makes one rebellious.  The most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks one's heart--hearts are made to be broken--but that it turns one's heart to stone.  One sometimes feels that it is only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all.  And he who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace, to use the phrase of which the Church is so fond--so rightly fond, I dare say--for in life as in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul, and shuts out the airs of heaven.  Yet I must learn these lessons here, if I am to learn them anywhere, and must be filled with joy if my feet are on the right road and my face set towards 'the gate which is called beautiful,' though I may fall many times in the mire and often in the mist go astray.  This New Life, as through my love of Dante I like sometimes to call it, is of course no new life at all, but simply the continuance, by means of development, and evolution, of my former life.  I remember when I was at Oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round Magdalen's narrow bird-haunted walks one morning in the year before I took my degree, that I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world, and that I was going out into the world with that passion in my soul.  And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived.  My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.  Failure, disgrace, poverty, sorrow, despair, suffering, tears even, the broken words that come from lips in pain, remorse that makes one walk on thorns, conscience that condemns, self- abasement that punishes, the misery that puts ashes on its head, the anguish that chooses sack-cloth for its raiment and into its own drink puts gall:--all these were things of which I was afraid.  And as I had determined to know nothing of them, I was forced to taste each of them in turn, to feed on them, to have for a season, indeed, no other food at all.  I don't regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure.  I did it to the full, as one should do everything that one does.  There was no pleasure I did not experience.  I threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine.  I went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes.  I lived on honeycomb.  But to have continued the same life would have been wrong because it would have been limiting.  I had to pass on.  The other half of the garden had its secrets for me also.  Of course all this is foreshadowed and prefigured in my books.  Some of it is in _The Happy Prince_, some of it in _The Young King_, notably in the passage where the bishop says to the kneeling boy, 'Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art'? a phrase which when I wrote it seemed to me little more than a phrase; a great deal of it is hidden away in the note of doom that like a purple thread runs through the texture of _Dorian Gray_; in _The Critic as Artist_ it is set forth in many colours; in _The Soul of Man_ it is written down, and in letters too easy to read; it is one of the refrains whose recurring _motifs_ make _Salome_ so like a piece of music and bind it together as a ballad; in the prose poem of the man who from the bronze of the image of the 'Pleasure that liveth for a moment' has to make the image of the 'Sorrow that abideth for ever' it is incarnate.  It could not have been otherwise.  At every single moment of one's life one is what one is going to be no less than what one has been.  Art is a symbol, because man is a symbol.  It is, if I can fully attain to it, the ultimate realisation of the artistic life.  For the artistic life is simply self-development. Humility in the artist is his frank acceptance of all experiences, just as love in the artist is simply the sense of beauty that reveals to the world its body and its soul.  In _Marius the Epicurean_ Pater seeks to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion, in the deep, sweet, and austere sense of the word.  But Marius is little more than a spectator: an ideal spectator indeed, and one to whom it is given 'to contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions,' which Wordsworth defines as the poet's true aim; yet a spectator merely, and perhaps a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of the sanctuary to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is gazing at.  I see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of Christ and the true life of the artist; and I take a keen pleasure in the reflection that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound me to her wheel I had written in _The Soul of Man_ that he who would lead a Christ-like life must be entirely and absolutely himself, and had taken as my types not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in his cell, but also the painter to whom the world is a pageant and the poet for whom the world is a song.  I remember saying once to Andre Gide, as we sat together in some Paris _cafe_, that while meta-physics had but little real interest for me, and morality absolutely none, there was nothing that either Plato or Christ had said that could not be transferred immediately into the sphere of Art and there find its complete fulfilment.  Nor is it merely that we can discern in Christ that close union of personality with perfection which forms the real distinction between the classical and romantic movement in life, but the very basis of his nature was the same as that of the nature of the artist--an intense and flamelike imagination.  He realised in the entire sphere of human relations that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of Art is the sole secret of creation.  He understood the leprosy of the leper, the darkness of the blind, the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure, the strange poverty of the rich.  Some one wrote to me in trouble, 'When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.'  How remote was the writer from what Matthew Arnold calls 'the Secret of Jesus.'  Either would have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to oneself, and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at night-time, and for pleasure or for pain, write up on the walls of your house in letters for the sun to gild and the moon to silver, 'Whatever happens to oneself happens to another.'  Christ's place indeed is with the poets.  His whole conception of Humanity sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by it.  What God was to the pantheist, man was to Him.  He was the first to conceive the divided races as a unity.  Before his time there had been gods and men, and, feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made incarnate, he calls himself the Son of the one or the Son of the other, according to his mood.  More than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always appeals.  There is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of a young Galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world; all that had already been done and suffered, and all that was yet to be done and suffered: the sins of Nero, of Caesar Borgia, of Alexander VI., and of him who was Emperor of Rome and Priest of the Sun: the sufferings of those whose names are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs: oppressed nationalities, factory children, thieves, people in prison, outcasts, those who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of God; and not merely imagining this but actually achieving it, so that at the present moment all who come in contact with his personality, even though they may neither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest, in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them.  I had said of Christ that he ranks with the poets.  That is true.  Shelley and Sophocles are of his company.  But his entire life also is the most wonderful of poems.  For 'pity and terror' there is nothing in the entire cycle of Greek tragedy to touch it.  The absolute purity of the protagonist raises the entire scheme to a height of romantic art from which the sufferings of Thebes and Pelops' line are by their very horror excluded, and shows how wrong Aristotle was when he said in his treatise on the drama that it would be impossible to bear the spectacle of one blameless in pain.  Nor in AEschylus nor Dante, those stern masters of tenderness, in Shakespeare, the most purely human of all the great artists, in the whole of Celtic myth and legend, where the loveliness of the world is shown through a mist of tears, and the life of a man is no more than the life of a flower, is there anything that, for sheer simplicity of pathos wedded and made one with sublimity of tragic effect, can be said to equal or even approach the last act of Christ's passion. The little supper with his companions, one of whom has already sold him for a price; the anguish in the quiet moon-lit garden; the false friend coming close to him so as to betray him with a kiss; the friend who still believed in him, and on whom as on a rock he had hoped to build a house of refuge for Man, denying him as the bird cried to the dawn; his own utter loneliness, his submission, his acceptance of everything; and along with it all such scenes as the high priest of orthodoxy rending his raiment in wrath, and the magistrate of civil justice calling for water in the vain hope of cleansing himself of that stain of innocent blood that makes him the scarlet figure of history; the coronation ceremony of sorrow, one of the most wonderful things in the whole of recorded time; the crucifixion of the Innocent One before the eyes of his mother and of the disciple whom he loved; the soldiers gambling and throwing dice for his clothes; the terrible death by which he gave the world its most eternal symbol; and his final burial in the tomb of the rich man, his body swathed in Egyptian linen with costly spices and perfumes as though he had been a king's son.  When one contemplates all this from the point of view of art alone one cannot but be grateful that the supreme office of the Church should be the playing of the tragedy without the shedding of blood: the mystical presentation, by means of dialogue and costume and gesture even, of the Passion of her Lord; and it is always a source of pleasure and awe to me to remember that the ultimate survival of the Greek chorus, lost elsewhere to art, is to be found in the servitor answering the priest at Mass.  Yet the whole life of Christ--so entirely may sorrow and beauty be made one in their meaning and manifestation--is really an idyll, though it ends with the veil of the temple being rent, and the darkness coming over the face of the earth, and the stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre. One always thinks of him as a young bridegroom with his companions, as indeed he somewhere describes himself; as a shepherd straying through a valley with his sheep in search of green meadow or cool stream; as a singer trying to build out of the music the walls of the City of God; or as a lover for whose love the whole world was too small.  His miracles seem to me to be as exquisite as the coming of spring, and quite as natural.  I see no difficulty at all in believing that such was the charm of his personality that his mere presence could bring peace to souls in anguish, and that those who touched his garments or his hands forgot their pain; or that as he passed by on the highway of life people who had seen nothing of life's mystery, saw it clearly, and others who had been deaf to every voice but that of pleasure heard for the first time the voice of love and found it as 'musical as Apollo's lute'; or that evil passions fled at his approach, and men whose dull unimaginative lives had been but a mode of death rose as it were from the grave when he called them; or that when he taught on the hillside the multitude forgot their hunger and thirst and the cares of this world, and that to his friends who listened to him as he sat at meat the coarse food seemed delicate, and the water had the taste of good wine, and the whole house became full of the odour and sweetness of nard.  Renan in his _Vie de Jesus_--that gracious fifth gospel, the gospel according to St. Thomas, one might call it--says somewhere that Christ's great achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death as he had been during his lifetime.  And certainly, if his place is among the poets, he is the leader of all the lovers.  He saw that love was the first secret of the world for which the wise men had been looking, and that it was only through love that one could approach either the heart of the leper or the feet of God.  And above all, Christ is the most supreme of individualists.  Humility, like the artistic, acceptance of all experiences, is merely a mode of manifestation.  It is man's soul that Christ is always looking for.  He calls it 'God's Kingdom,' and finds it in every one.  He compares it to little things, to a tiny seed, to a handful of leaven, to a pearl.  That is because one realises one's soul only by getting rid of all alien passions, all acquired culture, and all external possessions, be they good or evil.  I bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature, till I had absolutely nothing left in the world but one thing.  I had lost my name, my position, my happiness, my freedom, my wealth.  I was a prisoner and a pauper.  But I still had my children left.  Suddenly they were taken away from me by the law.  It was a blow so appalling that I did not know what to do, so I flung myself on my knees, and bowed my head, and wept, and said, 'The body of a child is as the body of the Lord: I am not worthy of either.'  That moment seemed to save me.  I saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything. Since then--curious as it will no doubt sound--I have been happier.  It was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that I had reached.  In many ways I had been its enemy, but I found it waiting for me as a friend.  When one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a child, as Christ said one should be.  It is tragic how few people ever 'possess their souls' before they die. 'Nothing is more rare in any man,' says Emerson, 'than an act of his own.'  It is quite true.  Most people are other people.  Their thoughts are some one else's opinions, their lives a mimicry, their passions a quotation.  Christ was not merely the supreme individualist, but he was the first individualist in history.  People have tried to make him out an ordinary philanthropist, or ranked him as an altruist with the scientific and sentimental.  But he was really neither one nor the other.  Pity he has, of course, for the poor, for those who are shut up in prisons, for the lowly, for the wretched; but he has far more pity for the rich, for the hard hedonists, for those who waste their freedom in becoming slaves to things, for those who wear soft raiment and live in kings' houses. Riches and pleasure seemed to him to be really greater tragedies than poverty or sorrow.  And as for altruism, who knew better than he that it is vocation not volition that determines us, and that one cannot gather grapes of thorns or figs from thistles?  To live for others as a definite self-conscious aim was not his creed.  It was not the basis of his creed.  When he says, 'Forgive your enemies,' it is not for the sake of the enemy, but for one's own sake that he says so, and because love is more beautiful than hate.  In his own entreaty to the young man, 'Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor,' it is not of the state of the poor that he is thinking but of the soul of the young man, the soul that wealth was marring.  In his view of life he is one with the artist who knows that by the inevitable law of self-perfection, the poet must sing, and the sculptor think in bronze, and the painter make the world a mirror for his moods, as surely and as certainly as the hawthorn must blossom in spring, and the corn turn to gold at harvest- time, and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to sickle, and from sickle to shield.  But while Christ did not say to men, 'Live for others,' he pointed out that there was no difference at all between the lives of others and |2
79|one's own life.  By this means he gave to man an extended, a Titan personality. Since his coming the history of each separate individual is, or can be made, the history of the world.  Of course, culture has intensified the personality of man.  Art has made us myriad-minded.  Those who have the artistic temperament go into exile with Dante and learn how salt is the bread of others, and how steep their stairs; they catch for a moment the serenity and calm of Goethe, and yet know but too well that Baudelaire cried to God--  Out of Shakespeare's sonnets they draw, to their own hurt it may be, the secret of his love and make it their own; they look with new eyes on modern life, because they have listened to one of Chopin's nocturnes, or handled Greek things, or read the story of the passion of some dead man for some dead woman whose hair was like threads of fine gold, and whose mouth was as a pomegranate.  But the sympathy of the artistic temperament is necessarily with what has found expression.  In words or in colours, in music or in marble, behind the painted masks of an AEschylean play, or through some Sicilian shepherds' pierced and jointed reeds, the man and his message must have been revealed.  To the artist, expression is the only mode under which he can conceive life at all.  To him what is dumb is dead.  But to Christ it was not so. With a width and wonder of imagination that fills one almost with awe, he took the entire world of the inarticulate, the voiceless world of pain, as his kingdom, and made of himself its eternal mouthpiece.  Those of whom I have spoken, who are dumb under oppression, and 'whose silence is heard only of God,' he chose as his brothers.  He sought to become eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, and a cry in the lips of those whose tongues had been tied.  His desire was to be to the myriads who had found no utterance a very trumpet through which they might call to heaven.  And feeling, with the artistic nature of one to whom suffering and sorrow were modes through which he could realise his conception of the beautiful, that an idea is of no value till it becomes incarnate and is made an image, he made of himself the image of the Man of Sorrows, and as such has fascinated and dominated art as no Greek god ever succeeded in doing.  For the Greek gods, in spite of the white and red of their fair fleet limbs, were not really what they appeared to be.  The curved brow of Apollo was like the sun's disc crescent over a hill at dawn, and his feet were as the wings of the morning, but he himself had been cruel to Marsyas and had made Niobe childless.  In the steel shields of Athena's eyes there had been no pity for Arachne; the pomp and peacocks of Hera were all that was really noble about her; and the Father of the Gods himself had been too fond of the daughters of men.  The two most deeply suggestive figures of Greek Mythology were, for religion, Demeter, an Earth Goddess, not one of the Olympians, and for art, Dionysus, the son of a mortal woman to whom the moment of his birth had proved also the moment of her death.  But Life itself from its lowliest and most humble sphere produced one far more marvellous than the mother of Proserpina or the son of Semele.  Out of the Carpenter's shop at Nazareth had come a personality infinitely greater than any made by myth and legend, and one, strangely enough, destined to reveal to the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real beauties of the lilies of the field as none, either on Cithaeron or at Enna, had ever done.  The song of Isaiah, 'He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him,' had seemed to him to prefigure himself, and in him the prophecy was fulfilled.  We must not be afraid of such a phrase.  Every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every work of art is the conversion of an idea into an image.  Every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy: for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal, either in the mind of God or in the mind of man.  Christ found the type and fixed it, and the dream of a Virgilian poet, either at Jerusalem or at Babylon, became in the long progress of the centuries incarnate in him for whom the world was waiting.  To me one of the things in history the most to be regretted is that the Christ's own renaissance, which has produced the Cathedral at Chartres, the Arthurian cycle of legends, the life of St. Francis of Assisi, the art of Giotto, and Dante's _Divine Comedy_, was not allowed to develop on its own lines, but was interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical Renaissance that gave us Petrarch, and Raphael's frescoes, and Palladian architecture, and formal French tragedy, and St. Paul's Cathedral, and Pope's poetry, and everything that is made from without and by dead rules, and does not spring from within through some spirit informing it. But wherever there is a romantic movement in art there somehow, and under some form, is Christ, or the soul of Christ.  He is in _Romeo and Juliet_, in the _Winter's Tale_, in Provencal poetry, in the _Ancient Mariner_, in _La Belle Dame sans merci_, and in Chatterton's _Ballad of Charity_.  We owe to him the most diverse things and people.  Hugo's _Les Miserables_, Baudelaire's _Fleurs du Mal_, the note of pity in Russian novels, Verlaine and Verlaine's poems, the stained glass and tapestries and the quattro-cento work of Burne-Jones and Morris, belong to him no less than the tower of Giotto, Lancelot and Guinevere, Tannhauser, the troubled romantic marbles of Michael Angelo, pointed architecture, and the love of children and flowers--for both of which, indeed, in classical art there was but little place, hardly enough for them to grow or play in, but which, from the twelfth century down to our own day, have been continually making their appearances in art, under various modes and at various times, coming fitfully and wilfully, as children, as flowers, are apt to do: spring always seeming to one as if the flowers had been in hiding, and only came out into the sun because they were afraid that grown up people would grow tired of looking for them and give up the search; and the life of a child being no more than an April day on which there is both rain and sun for the narcissus.  It is the imaginative quality of Christ's own nature that makes him this palpitating centre of romance.  The strange figures of poetic drama and ballad are made by the imagination of others, but out of his own imagination entirely did Jesus of Nazareth create himself.  The cry of Isaiah had really no more to do with his coming than the song of the nightingale has to do with the rising of the moon--no more, though perhaps no less.  He was the denial as well as the affirmation of prophecy.  For every expectation that he fulfilled there was another that he destroyed.  'In all beauty,' says Bacon, 'there is some strangeness of proportion,' and of those who are born of the spirit--of those, that is to say, who like himself are dynamic forces--Christ says that they are like the wind that 'bloweth where it listeth, and no man can tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth.'  That is why he is so fascinating to artists.  He has all the colour elements of life: mystery, strangeness, pathos, suggestion, ecstasy, love.  He appeals to the temper of wonder, and creates that mood in which alone he can be understood.  And to me it is a joy to remember that if he is 'of imagination all compact,' the world itself is of the same substance.  I said in _Dorian Gray_ that the great sins of the world take place in the brain: but it is in the brain that everything takes place.  We know now that we do not see with the eyes or hear with the ears.  They are really channels for the transmission, adequate or inadequate, of sense impressions.  It is in the brain that the poppy is red, that the apple is odorous, that the skylark sings.  Of late I have been studying with diligence the four prose poems about Christ.  At Christmas I managed to get hold of a Greek Testament, and every morning, after I had cleaned my cell and polished my tins, I read a little of the Gospels, a dozen verses taken by chance anywhere.  It is a delightful way of opening the day.  Every one, even in a turbulent, ill- disciplined life, should do the same.  Endless repetition, in and out of season, has spoiled for us the freshness, the naivete, the simple romantic charm of the Gospels.  We hear them read far too often and far too badly, and all repetition is anti-spiritual.  When one returns to the Greek; it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some, narrow and dark house.  And to me, the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely probable that we have the actual terms, the _ipsissima verba_, used by Christ.  It was always supposed that Christ talked in Aramaic.  Even Renan thought so.  But now we know that the Galilean peasants, like the Irish peasants of our own day, were bilingual, and that Greek was the ordinary language of intercourse all over Palestine, as indeed all over the Eastern world.  I never liked the idea that we knew of Christ's own words only through a translation of a translation.  It is a delight to me to think that as far as his conversation was concerned, Charmides might have listened to him, and Socrates reasoned with him, and Plato understood him: that he really said [Greek text], that when he thought of the lilies of the field and how they neither toil nor spin, his absolute expression was [Greek text], and that his last word when he cried out 'my life has been completed, has reached its fulfilment, has been perfected,' was exactly as St. John tells us it was: [Greek text]--no more.  While in reading the Gospels--particularly that of St. John himself, or whatever early Gnostic took his name and mantle--I see the continual assertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material life, I see also that to Christ imagination was simply a form of love, and that to him love was lord in the fullest meaning of the phrase.  Some six weeks ago I was allowed by the doctor to have white bread to eat instead of the coarse black or brown bread of ordinary prison fare.  It is a great delicacy.  It will sound strange that dry bread could possibly be a delicacy to any one.  To me it is so much so that at the close of each meal I carefully eat whatever crumbs may be left on my tin plate, or have fallen on the rough towel that one uses as a cloth so as not to soil one's table; and I do so not from hunger--I get now quite sufficient food--but simply in order that nothing should be wasted of what is given to me.  So one should look on love.  Christ, like all fascinating personalities, had the power of not merely saying beautiful things himself, but of making other people say beautiful things to him; and I love the story St. Mark tells us about the Greek woman, who, when as a trial of her faith he said to her that he could not give her the bread of the children of Israel, answered him that the little dogs--([Greek text], 'little dogs' it should be rendered)--who are under the table eat of the crumbs that the children let fall.  Most people live for love and admiration.  But it is by love and admiration that we should live.  If any love is shown us we should recognise that we are quite unworthy of it.  Nobody is worthy to be loved.  The fact that God loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy. Or if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear, let us say that every one is worthy of love, except him who thinks that he is.  Love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling, and _Domine, non sum dignus_ should be on the lips and in the hearts of those who receive it.  If ever I write again, in the sense of producing artistic work, there are just two subjects on which and through which I desire to express myself: one is 'Christ as the precursor of the romantic movement in life': the other is 'The artistic life considered in its relation to conduct.'  The first is, of course, intensely fascinating, for I see in Christ not merely the essentials of the supreme romantic type, but all the accidents, the wilfulnesses even, of the romantic temperament also.  He was the first person who ever said to people that they should live 'flower-like lives.'  He fixed the phrase.  He took children as the type of what people should try to become.  He held them up as examples to their elders, which I myself have always thought the chief use of children, if what is perfect should have a use.  Dante describes the soul of a man as coming from the hand of God 'weeping and laughing like a little child,' and Christ also saw that the soul of each one should be _a guisa di fanciulla che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia_.  He felt that life was changeful, fluid, active, and that to allow it to be stereotyped into any form was death.  He saw that people should not be too serious over material, common interests: that to be unpractical was to be a great thing: that one should not bother too much over affairs.  The birds didn't, why should man?  He is charming when he says, 'Take no thought for the morrow; is not the soul more than meat? is not the body more than raiment?'  A Greek might have used the latter phrase.  It is full of Greek feeling.  But only Christ could have said both, and so summed up life perfectly for us.  His morality is all sympathy, just what morality should be.  If the only thing that he ever said had been, 'Her sins are forgiven her because she loved much,' it would have been worth while dying to have said it.  His justice is all poetical justice, exactly what justice should be.  The beggar goes to heaven because he has been unhappy.  I cannot conceive a better reason for his being sent there.  The people who work for an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as those who have toiled there all day long in the hot sun.  Why shouldn't they?  Probably no one deserved anything.  Or perhaps they were a different kind of people.  Christ had no patience with the dull lifeless mechanical systems that treat people as if they were things, and so treat everybody alike: for him there were no laws: there were exceptions merely, as if anybody, or anything, for that matter, was like aught else in the world!  That which is the very keynote of romantic art was to him the proper basis of natural life.  He saw no other basis.  And when they brought him one, taken in the very act of sin and showed him her sentence written in the law, and asked him what was to be done, he wrote with his finger on the ground as though he did not hear them, and finally, when they pressed him again, looked up and said, 'Let him of you who has never sinned be the first to throw the stone at her.'  It was worth while living to have said that.  Like all poetical natures he loved ignorant people.  He knew that in the soul of one who is ignorant there is always room for a great idea.  But he could not stand stupid people, especially those who are made stupid by education: people who are full of opinions not one of which they even understand, a peculiarly modern type, summed up by Christ when he describes it as the type of one who has the key of knowledge, cannot use it himself, and does not allow other people to use it, though it may be made to open the gate of God's Kingdom.  His chief war was against the Philistines.  That is the war every child of light has to wage. Philistinism was the note of the age and community in which he lived.  In their heavy inaccessibility to ideas, their dull respectability, their tedious orthodoxy, their worship of vulgar success, their entire preoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life, and their ridiculous estimate of themselves and their importance, the Jews of Jerusalem in Christ's day were the exact counterpart of the British Philistine of our own.  Christ mocked at the 'whited sepulchre' of respectability, and fixed that phrase for ever.  He treated worldly success as a thing absolutely to be despised.  He saw nothing in it at all.  He looked on wealth as an encumbrance to a man.  He would not hear of life being sacrificed to any system of thought or morals.  He pointed out that forms and ceremonies were made for man, not man for forms and ceremonies.  He took sabbatarianism as a type of the things that should be set at nought.  The cold philanthropies, the ostentatious public charities, the tedious formalisms so dear to the middle-class mind, he exposed with utter and relentless scorn.  To us, what is termed orthodoxy is merely a facile unintelligent acquiescence; but to them, and in their hands, it was a terrible and paralysing tyranny.  Christ swept it aside. He showed that the spirit alone was of value.  He took a keen pleasure in pointing out to them that though they were always reading the law and the prophets, they had not really the smallest idea of what either of them meant.  In opposition to their tithing of each separate day into the fixed routine of prescribed duties, as they tithe mint and rue, he preached the enormous importance of living completely for the moment.  Those whom he saved from their sins are saved simply for beautiful moments in their lives.  Mary Magdalen, when she sees Christ, breaks the rich vase of alabaster that one of her seven lovers had given her, and spills the odorous spices over his tired dusty feet, and for that one moment's sake sits for ever with Ruth and Beatrice in the tresses of the snow-white rose of Paradise.  All that Christ says to us by the way of a little warning is that every moment should be beautiful, that the soul should always be ready for the coming of the bridegroom, always waiting for the voice of the lover, Philistinism being simply that side of man's nature that is not illumined by the imagination.  He sees all the lovely influences of life as modes of light: the imagination itself is the world of light.  The world is made by it, and yet the world cannot understand it: that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of love, and it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being from another.  But it is when he deals with a sinner that Christ is most romantic, in the sense of most real.  The world had always loved the saint as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of God.  Christ, through some divine instinct in him, seems to have always loved the sinner as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man.  His primary desire was not to reform people, any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering.  To turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim.  He would have thought little of the Prisoners' Aid Society and other modern movements of the kind.  The conversion of a publican into a Pharisee would not have seemed to him a great achievement.  But in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes of perfection.  It seems a very dangerous idea.  It is--all great ideas are dangerous. That it was Christ's creed admits of no doubt.  That it is the true creed I don't doubt myself.  Of course the sinner must repent.  But why?  Simply because otherwise he would be unable to realise what he had done.  The moment of repentance is the moment of initiation.  More than that: it is the means by which one alters one's past.  The Greeks thought that impossible.  They often say in their Gnomic aphorisms, 'Even the Gods cannot alter the past.'  Christ showed that the commonest sinner could do it, that it was the one thing he could do.  Christ, had he been asked, would have said--I feel quite certain about it--that the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and wept, he made his having wasted his substance with harlots, his swine- herding and hungering for the husks they ate, beautiful and holy moments in his life.  It is difficult for most people to grasp the idea.  I dare say one has to go to prison to understand it.  If so, it may be worth while going to prison.  There is something so unique about Christ.  Of course just as there are false dawns before the dawn itself, and winter days so full of sudden sunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold before its time, and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on barren boughs, so there were Christians before Christ.  For that we should be grateful.  The unfortunate thing is that there have been none since.  I make one exception, St. Francis of Assisi.  But then God had given him at his birth the soul of a poet, as he himself when quite young had in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride: and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not difficult.  He understood Christ, and so he became like him.  We do not require the Liber Conformitatum to teach us that the life of St. Francis was the true _Imitatio Christi_, a poem compared to which the book of that name is merely prose.  Indeed, that is the charm about Christ, when all is said: he is just like a work of art.  He does not really teach one anything, but by being brought into his presence one becomes something.  And everybody is predestined to his presence.  Once at least in his life each man walks with Christ to Emmaus.  As regards the other subject, the Relation of the Artistic Life to Conduct, it will no doubt seem strange to you that I should select it. People point to Reading Gaol and say, 'That is where the artistic life leads a man.'  Well, it might lead to worse places.  The more mechanical people to whom life is a shrewd speculation depending on a careful calculation of ways and means, always know where they are going, and go there.  They start with the ideal desire of being the parish beadle, and in whatever sphere they are placed they succeed in being the parish beadle and no more.  A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be.  That is his punishment.  Those who want a mask have to wear it.  But with the dynamic forces of life, and those in whom those dynamic forces become incarnate, it is different.  People whose desire is solely for self-realisation never know where they are going.  They can't know. In one sense of the word it is of course necessary, as the Greek oracle said, to know oneself: that is the first achievement of knowledge.  But to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable, is the ultimate achievement of wisdom.  The final mystery is oneself.  When one has weighed the sun in the balance, and measured the steps of the moon, and mapped out the seven heavens star by star, there still remains oneself. Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?  When the son went out to look for his father's asses, he did not know that a man of God was waiting for him with the very chrism of coronation, and that his own soul was already the soul of a king.  I hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character that I shall be able at the end of my days to say, 'Yes! this is just where the artistic life leads a man!'  Two of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience are the lives of Verlaine and of Prince Kropotkin: both of them men who have passed years in prison: the first, the one Christian poet since Dante; the other, a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ which seems coming out of Russia.  And for the last seven or eight months, in spite of a succession of great troubles reaching me from the outside world almost without intermission, I have been placed in direct contact with a new spirit working in this prison through man and things, that has helped me beyond any possibility of expression in words: so that while for the first year of my imprisonment I did nothing else, and can remember doing nothing else, but wring my hands in impotent despair, and say, 'What an ending, what an appalling ending!' now I try to say to myself, and sometimes when I am not torturing myself do really and sincerely say, 'What a beginning, what a wonderful beginning!'  It may really be so.  It may become so.  If it does I shall owe much to this new personality that has altered every man's life in this place.  You may realise it when I say that had I been released last May, as I tried to be, I would have left this place loathing it and every official in it with a bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life.  I have had a year longer of imprisonment, but humanity has been in the prison along with us all, and now when I go out I shall always remember great kindnesses that I have received here from almost everybody, and on the day of my release I shall give many thanks to many people, and ask to be remembered by them in turn.  The prison style is absolutely and entirely wrong.  I would give anything to be able to alter it when I go out.  I intend to try.  But there is nothing in the world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of love, the spirit of the Christ who is not in churches, may make it, if not right, at least possible to be borne without too much bitterness of heart.  I know also that much is waiting for me outside that is very delightful, from what St. Francis of Assisi calls 'my brother the wind, and my sister the rain,' lovely things both of them, down to the shop-windows and sunsets of great cities.  If I made a list of all that still remains to me, I don't know where I should stop: for, indeed, God made the world just as much for me as for any one else.  Perhaps I may go out with something that I had not got before.  I need not tell you that to me reformations in morals are as meaningless and vulgar as Reformations in theology.  But while to propose to be a better man is a piece of unscientific cant, to have become a deeper man is the privilege of those who have suffered.  And such I think I have become.  If after I am free a friend of mine gave a feast, and did not invite me to it, I should not mind a bit.  I can be perfectly happy by myself.  With freedom, flowers, books, and the moon, who could not be perfectly happy? Besides, feasts are not for me any more.  I have given too many to care about them.  That side of life is over for me, very fortunately, I dare say.  But if after I am free a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it, I should feel it most bitterly.  If he shut the doors of the house of mourning against me, I would come back again and again and beg to be admitted, so that I might share in what I was entitled to share in.  If he thought me unworthy, unfit to weep with him, I should feel it as the most poignant humiliation, as the most terrible mode in which disgrace could be inflicted on me.  But that could not be. I have a right to share in sorrow, and he who can look at the loveliness of the world and share its sorrow, and realise something of the wonder of both, is in immediate contact with divine things, and has got as near to God's secret as any one can get.  Perhaps there may come into my art also, no less than into my life, a still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and directness of impulse.  Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art.  We are no longer in art concerned with the type.  It is with the exception that we have to do.  I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I need hardly say.  Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of some aesthetic quality at any rate.  When Marsyas was 'torn from the scabbard of his limbs'--_della vagina della membre sue_, to use one of Dante's most terrible Tacitean phrases--he had no more song, the Greek said.  Apollo had been victor. The lyre had vanquished the reed.  But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken. I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas.  It is bitter in Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine.  It is in the deferred resolutions of Chopin's music.  It is in the discontent that haunts Burne-Jones's women.  Even Matthew Ar|2
80|"nold, whose song of Callicles tells of 'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,' and the 'famous final victory,' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for _Thyrsis_ or to sing of the _Scholar Gipsy_, it is the reed that he has to take for the rendering of his strain.  But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was silent, I cannot be.  Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind.  Between my art and the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there is none.  I hope at least that there is none.  To each of us different fates are meted out.  My lot has been one of public infamy, of long imprisonment, of misery, of ruin, of disgrace, but I am not worthy of it--not yet, at any rate.  I remember that I used to say that I thought I could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow, but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy, so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style.  It is quite true about modernity.  It has probably always been true about actual life.  It is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker on.  The nineteenth century is no exception to the rule.  Everything about my tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in style; our very dress makes us grotesque.  We are the zanies of sorrow. We are clowns whose hearts are broken.  We are specially designed to appeal to the sense of humour.  On November 13th, 1895, I was brought down here from London.  From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I had to stand on the centre platform of Clapham Junction in convict dress, and handcuffed, for the world to look at.  I had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me.  Of all possible objects I was the most grotesque.  When people saw me they laughed.  Each train as it came up swelled the audience.  Nothing could exceed their amusement.  That was, of course, before they knew who I was. As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more.  For half an hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob.  For a year after that was done to me I wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time.  That is not such a tragic thing as possibly it sounds to you.  To those who are in prison tears are a part of every day's experience.  A day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which one's heart is hard, not a day on which one's heart is happy.  Well, now I am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who laughed than for myself.  Of course when they saw me I was not on my pedestal, I was in the pillory.  But it is a very unimaginative nature that only cares for people on their pedestals.  A pedestal may be a very unreal thing.  A pillory is a terrific reality.  They should have known also how to interpret sorrow better.  I have said that behind sorrow there is always sorrow.  It were wiser still to say that behind sorrow there is always a soul.  And to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful thing.  In the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what they give, and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the mere outward of things, and feel pity, what pity can be given save that of scorn?  I write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that it should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of my punishment but bitterness and despair.  I have, however, to do it, and now and then I have moments of submission and acceptance.  All the spring may be hidden in the single bud, and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rose-red dawns.  So perhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some moment of surrender, abasement, and humiliation.  I can, at any rate, merely proceed on the lines of my own development, and, accepting all that has happened to me, make myself worthy of it.  People used to say of me that I was too individualistic.  I must be far more of an individualist than ever I was.  I must get far more out of myself than ever I got, and ask far less of the world than ever I asked. Indeed, my ruin came not from too great individualism of life, but from too little.  The one disgraceful, unpardonable, and to all time contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society for help and protection.  To have made such an appeal would have been from the individualist point of view bad enough, but what excuse can there ever be put forward for having made it?  Of course once I had put into motion the forces of society, society turned on me and said, 'Have you been living all this time in defiance of my laws, and do you now appeal to those laws for protection?  You shall have those laws exercised to the full.  You shall abide by what you have appealed to.'  The result is I am in gaol.  Certainly no man ever fell so ignobly, and by such ignoble instruments, as I did.  The Philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art. Charming people, such as fishermen, shepherds, ploughboys, peasants and the like, know nothing about art, and are the very salt of the earth.  He is the Philistine who upholds and aids the heavy, cumbrous, blind, mechanical forces of society, and who does not recognise dynamic force when he meets it either in a man or a movement.  People thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil things of life, and to have found pleasure in their company.  But then, from the point of view through which I, as an artist in life, approach them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating.  The danger was half the excitement. . . . My business as an artist was with Ariel.  I set myself to wrestle with Caliban. . . .  A great friend of mine--a friend of ten years' standing--came to see me some time ago, and told me that he did not believe a single word of what was said against me, and wished me to know that he considered me quite innocent, and the victim of a hideous plot.  I burst into tears at what he said, and told him that while there was much amongst the definite charges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice, still that my life had been full of perverse pleasures, and that unless he accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full I could not possibly be friends with him any more, or ever be in his company.  It was a terrible shock to him, but we are friends, and I have not got his friendship on false pretences.  Emotional forces, as I say somewhere in _Intentions_, are as limited in extent and duration as the forces of physical energy.  The little cup that is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more, though all the purple vats of Burgundy be filled with wine to the brim, and the treaders stand knee-deep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of Spain. There is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are the causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable to the tragic mood: no error more fatal than expecting it of them.  The martyr in his 'shirt of flame' may be looking on the face of God, but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe.  Great passions are for the great of soul, and great events can be seen only by those who are on a level with them.  * * * * *  I know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of art, nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation, than Shakespeare's drawing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  They are Hamlet's college friends.  They have been his companions.  They bring with them memories of pleasant days together.  At the moment when they come across him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament.  The dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him.  He is a dreamer, and he is called upon to act.  He has the nature of the poet, and he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect, with life in its practical realisation, of which he knows nothing, not with life in its ideal essence, of which he knows so much. He has no conception of what to do, and his folly is to feign folly. Brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose, the dagger of his will, but the Hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of weakness.  In the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay.  He keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory.  He makes himself the spy of his proper actions, and listening to his own words knows them to be but 'words, words, words.'  Instead of trying to be the hero of his own history, he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy.  He disbelieves in everything, including himself, and yet his doubt helps him not, as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided will.  Of all this Guildenstern and Rosencrantz realise nothing.  They bow and smirk and smile, and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest intonation.  When, at last, by means of the play within the play, and the puppets in their dalliance, Hamlet 'catches the conscience' of the King, and drives the wretched man in terror from his throne, Guildenstern and Rosencrantz see no more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of Court etiquette.  That is as far as they can attain to in 'the contemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions.'  They are close to his very secret and know nothing of it.  Nor would there be any use in telling them.  They are the little cups that can hold so much and no more.  Towards the close it is suggested that, caught in a cunning spring set for another, they have met, or may meet, with a violent and sudden death.  But a tragic ending of this kind, though touched by Hamlet's humour with something of the surprise and justice of comedy, is really not for such as they.  They never die.  Horatio, who in order to 'report Hamlet and his cause aright to the unsatisfied,'     'Absents him from felicity a while,    And in this harsh world draws his breath in pain,'  dies, but Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are as immortal as Angelo and Tartuffe, and should rank with them.  They are what modern life has contributed to the antique ideal of friendship.  He who writes a new _De Amicitia_ must find a niche for them, and praise them in Tusculan prose. They are types fixed for all time.  To censure them would show 'a lack of appreciation.'  They are merely out of their sphere: that is all.  In sublimity of soul there is no contagion.  High thoughts and high emotions are by their very existence isolated.  * * * * *  I am to be released, if all goes well with me, towards the end of May, and hope to go at once to some little sea-side village abroad with R--- and M---.  The sea, as Euripides says in one of his plays about Iphigeneia, washes away the stains and wounds of the world.  I hope to be at least a month with my friends, and to gain peace and balance, and a less troubled heart, and a sweeter mood.  I have a strange longing for the great simple primeval things, such as the sea, to me no less of a mother than the Earth.  It seems to me that we all look at Nature too much, and live with her too little.  I discern great sanity in the Greek attitude.  They never chattered about sunsets, or discussed whether the shadows on the grass were really mauve or not.  But they saw that the sea was for the swimmer, and the sand for the feet of the runner.  They loved the trees for the shadow that they cast, and the forest for its silence at noon.  The vineyard-dresser wreathed his hair with ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over the young shoots, and for the artist and the athlete, the two types that Greece gave us, they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the wild parsley, which else had been of no service to men.  We call ours a utilitarian age, and we do not know the uses of any single thing.  We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and that the Earth is mother to us all.  As a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things.  I feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification, and I want to go back to them and live in their presence.  Of course to one so modern as I am, 'Enfant de mon siecle,' merely to look at the world will be always lovely.  I tremble with pleasure when I think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens, and that I shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one, and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes, so that all the air shall be Arabia for me.  Linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some English upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze; and I know that for me, to whom flowers are part of desire, there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose.  It has always been so with me from my boyhood.  There is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower, or the curve of a shell, to which, by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things, my nature does not answer.  Like Gautier, I have always been one of those 'pour qui le monde visible existe.'  Still, I am conscious now that behind all this beauty, satisfying though it may be, there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but modes of manifestation, and it is with this spirit that I desire to become in harmony.  I have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things.  The Mystical in Art, the Mystical in Life, the Mystical in Nature this is what I am looking for.  It is absolutely necessary for me to find it somewhere.  All trials are trials for one's life, just as all sentences are sentences of death; and three times have I been tried.  The first time I left the box to be arrested, the second time to be led back to the house of detention, the third time to pass into a prison for two years.  Society, as we have constituted it, will have no place for me, has none to offer; but Nature, whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike, will have clefts in the rocks where I may hide, and secret valleys in whose silence I may weep undisturbed.  She will hang the night with stars so that I may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling, and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt: she will cleanse me in great waters, and with bitter herbs make me whole.                  I.                 He did not wear his scarlet coat,                  For blood and wine are red,                And blood and wine were on his hands                  When they found him with the dead,                The poor dead woman whom he loved,                  And murdered in her bed.                 He walked amongst the Trial Men                  In a suit of shabby grey;                A cricket cap was on his head,                  And his step seemed light and gay;                But I never saw a man who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw a man who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  Which prisoners call the sky,                And at every drifting cloud that went                  With sails of silver by.                 I walked, with other souls in pain,                  Within another ring,                And was wondering if the man had done                  A great or little thing,                When a voice behind me whispered low,                  ""That fellow's got to swing.""                 Dear Christ! the very prison walls                  Suddenly seemed to reel,                And the sky above my head became                  Like a casque of scorching steel;                And, though I was a soul in pain,                  My pain I could not feel.                 I only knew what hunted thought                  Quickened his step, and why                He looked upon the garish day                  With such a wistful eye;                The man had killed the thing he loved                  And so he had to die.                 Yet each man kills the thing he loves                  By each let this be heard,                Some do it with a bitter look,                  Some with a flattering word,                The coward does it with a kiss,                  The brave man with a sword!                 Some kill their love when they are young,                  And some when they are old;                Some strangle with the hands of Lust,                  Some with the hands of Gold:                The kindest use a knife, because                  The dead so soon grow cold.                 Some love too little, some too long,                  Some sell, and others buy;                Some do the deed with many tears,                  And some without a sigh:                For each man kills the thing he loves,                  Yet each man does not die.                 He does not die a death of shame                  On a day of dark disgrace,                Nor have a noose about his neck,                  Nor a cloth upon his face,                Nor drop feet foremost through the floor                  Into an empty place                 He does not sit with silent men                  Who watch him night and day;                Who watch him when he tries to weep,                  And when he tries to pray;                Who watch him lest himself should rob                  The prison of its prey.                 He does not wake at dawn to see                  Dread figures throng his room,                The shivering Chaplain robed in white,                  The Sheriff stern with gloom,                And the Governor all in shiny black,                  With the yellow face of Doom.                 He does not rise in piteous haste                  To put on convict-clothes,                While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes                  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,                Fingering a watch whose little ticks                  Are like horrible hammer-blows.                 He does not know that sickening thirst                  That sands one's throat, before                The hangman with his gardener's gloves                  Slips through the padded door,                And binds one with three leathern thongs,                  That the throat may thirst no more.                 He does not bend his head to hear                  The Burial Office read,                Nor, while the terror of his soul                  Tells him he is not dead,                Cross his own coffin, as he moves                  Into the hideous shed.                 He does not stare upon the air                  Through a little roof of glass;                He does not pray with lips of clay                  For his agony to pass;                Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek                  The kiss of Caiaphas.                   II.                 Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,                  In a suit of shabby grey:                His cricket cap was on his head,                  And his step seemed light and gay,                But I never saw a man who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw a man who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  Which prisoners call the sky,                And at every wandering cloud that trailed                  Its raveled fleeces by.                 He did not wring his hands, as do                  Those witless men who dare                To try to rear the changeling Hope                  In the cave of black Despair:                He only looked upon the sun,                  And drank the morning air.                 He did not wring his hands nor weep,                  Nor did he peek or pine,                But he drank the air as though it held                  Some healthful anodyne;                With open mouth he drank the sun                  As though it had been wine!                 And I and all the souls in pain,                  Who tramped the other ring,                Forgot if we ourselves had done                  A great or little thing,                And watched with gaze of dull amaze                  The man who had to swing.                 And strange it was to see him pass                  With a step so light and gay,                And strange it was to see him look                  So wistfully at the day,                And strange it was to think that he                  Had such a debt to pay.                 For oak and elm have pleasant leaves                  That in the spring-time shoot:                But grim to see is the gallows-tree,                  With its adder-bitten root,                And, green or dry, a man must die                  Before it bears its fruit!                 The loftiest place is that seat of grace                  For which all worldlings try:                But who would stand in hempen band                  Upon a scaffold high,                And through a murderer's collar take                  His last look at the sky?                 It is sweet to dance to violins                  When Love and Life are fair:                To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes                  Is delicate and rare:                But it is not sweet with nimble feet                  To dance upon the air!                 So with curious eyes and sick surmise                  We watched him day by day,                And wondered if each one of us                  Would end the self-same way,                For none can tell to what red Hell                  His sightless soul may stray.                 At last the dead man walked no more                  Amongst the Trial Men,                And I knew that he was standing up                  In the black dock's dreadful pen,                And that never would I see his face                  In God's sweet world again.                 Like two doomed ships that pass in storm                  We had crossed each other's way:                But we made no sign, we said no word,                  We had no word to say;                For we did not meet in the holy night,                  But in the shameful day.                 A prison wall was round us both,                  Two outcast men were we:                The world had thrust us from its heart,                  And God from out His care:                And the iron gin that waits for Sin                  Had caught us in its snare.                 In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,                  And the dripping wall is high,                So it was there he took the air                  Beneath the leaden sky,                And by each side a Warder walked,                  For fear the man might die.                 Or else he sat with those who watched                  His anguish night and day;                Who watched him when he rose to weep,                  And when he crouched to pray;                Who watched him lest himself should rob                  Their scaffold of its prey.                 The Governor was strong upon                  The Regulations Act:                The Doctor said that Death was but                  A scientific fact:                And twice a day the Chaplain called                  And left a little tract.                 And twice a day he smoked his pipe,                  And drank his quart of beer:                His soul was resolute, and held                  No hiding-place for fear;                He often said that he was glad                  The hangman's hands were near.                 But why he said so strange a thing                  No Warder dared to ask:                For he to whom a watcher's doom                  Is given as his task,                Must set a lock upon his lips,                  And make his face a mask.                 Or else he might be moved, and try                  To comfort or console:                And what should Human Pity do                  Pent up in Murderers' Hole?                What word of grace in such a place                  Could help a brother's soul?                 With slouch and swing around the ring                  We trod the Fool's Parade!                We did not care: we knew we were                  The Devil's Own Brigade:                And shaven head and feet of lead                  Make a merry masquerade.                 We tore the tarry rope to shreds                  With blunt and bleeding nails;                We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,                  And cleaned the shining rails:                And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,                  And clattered with the pails.                 We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,                  We turned the dusty drill:                We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,                  And sweated on the mill:                But in the heart of every man                  Terror was lying still.                 So still it lay that every day                  Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:                And we forgot the bitter lot                  That waits for fool and knave,                Till once, as we tramped in from work,                  We passed an open grave.                 With yawning mouth the yellow hole                  Gaped for a living thing;                The very mud cried out for blood                  To the thirsty asphalte ring:                And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair                  Some prisoner had to swing.                 Right in we went, with soul intent                  On Death and Dread and Doom:                The hangman, with his little bag,                  Went shuffling through the gloom                And each man trembled as he crept                  Into his numbered tomb.                 That night the empty corridors                  Were full of forms of Fear,                And up and down the iron town                  Stole feet we could not hear,                And through the bars that hide the stars                  White faces seemed to peer.                 He lay as one who lies and dreams                  In a pleasant meadow-land,                The watcher watched him as he slept,                  And could not understand                How one could sleep so sweet a sleep                  With a hangman close at hand?                 But there is no sleep when men must weep                  Who never yet have wept:                So we--the fool, the fraud, the knave--                  That endless vigil kept,                And through each brain on hands of pain                  Another's terror crept.                 Alas! it is a fearful thing                  To feel another's guilt!                For, right within, the sword of Sin                  Pierced to its poisoned hilt,                And as molten lead were the tears we shed                  For the blood we had not spilt.                 The Warders with their shoes of felt                  Crept by each padlocked door,                And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,                  Grey figures on the floor,                And wondered why men knelt to pray                  Who never prayed before.                 All through the night we knelt and prayed,                  Mad mou"|2
81|"rners of a corpse!                The troubled plumes of midnight were                  The plumes upon a hearse:                And bitter wine upon a sponge                  Was the savior of Remorse.                 The cock crew, the red cock crew,                  But never came the day:                And crooked shape of Terror crouched,                  In the corners where we lay:                And each evil sprite that walks by night                  Before us seemed to play.                 They glided past, they glided fast,                  Like travelers through a mist:                They mocked the moon in a rigadoon                  Of delicate turn and twist,                And with formal pace and loathsome grace                  The phantoms kept their tryst.                 With mop and mow, we saw them go,                  Slim shadows hand in hand:                About, about, in ghostly rout                  They trod a saraband:                And the damned grotesques made arabesques,                  Like the wind upon the sand!                 With the pirouettes of marionettes,                  They tripped on pointed tread:                But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,                  As their grisly masque they led,                And loud they sang, and loud they sang,                  For they sang to wake the dead.                 ""Oho!"" they cried, ""The world is wide,                  But fettered limbs go lame!                And once, or twice, to throw the dice                  Is a gentlemanly game,                But he does not win who plays with Sin                  In the secret House of Shame.""                No things of air these antics were                  That frolicked with such glee:                To men whose lives were held in gyves,                  And whose feet might not go free,                Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,                  Most terrible to see.                Around, around, they waltzed and wound;                  Some wheeled in smirking pairs:                With the mincing step of demirep                  Some sidled up the stairs:                And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,                  Each helped us at our prayers.                 The morning wind began to moan,                  But still the night went on:                Through its giant loom the web of gloom                  Crept till each thread was spun:                And, as we prayed, we grew afraid                  Of the Justice of the Sun.                 The moaning wind went wandering round                  The weeping prison-wall:                Till like a wheel of turning-steel                  We felt the minutes crawl:                O moaning wind! what had we done                  To have such a seneschal?                 At last I saw the shadowed bars                  Like a lattice wrought in lead,                Move right across the whitewashed wall                  That faced my three-plank bed,                And I knew that somewhere in the world                  God's dreadful dawn was red.                 At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,                  At seven all was still,                But the sough and swing of a mighty wing                  The prison seemed to fill,                For the Lord of Death with icy breath                  Had entered in to kill.                 He did not pass in purple pomp,                  Nor ride a moon-white steed.                Three yards of cord and a sliding board                  Are all the gallows' need:                So with rope of shame the Herald came                  To do the secret deed.                 We were as men who through a fen                  Of filthy darkness grope:                We did not dare to breathe a prayer,                  Or give our anguish scope:                Something was dead in each of us,                  And what was dead was Hope.                 For Man's grim Justice goes its way,                  And will not swerve aside:                It slays the weak, it slays the strong,                  It has a deadly stride:                With iron heel it slays the strong,                  The monstrous parricide!                 We waited for the stroke of eight:                  Each tongue was thick with thirst:                For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate                  That makes a man accursed,                And Fate will use a running noose                  For the best man and the worst.                 We had no other thing to do,                  Save to wait for the sign to come:                So, like things of stone in a valley lone,                  Quiet we sat and dumb:                But each man's heart beat thick and quick                  Like a madman on a drum!                 With sudden shock the prison-clock                  Smote on the shivering air,                And from all the gaol rose up a wail                  Of impotent despair,                Like the sound that frightened marshes hear                  From a leper in his lair.                 And as one sees most fearful things                  In the crystal of a dream,                We saw the greasy hempen rope                  Hooked to the blackened beam,                And heard the prayer the hangman's snare                  Strangled into a scream.                 And all the woe that moved him so                  That he gave that bitter cry,                And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,                  None knew so well as I:                For he who live more lives than one                  More deaths than one must die.                   IV.                 There is no chapel on the day                  On which they hang a man:                The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,                  Or his face is far to wan,                Or there is that written in his eyes                  Which none should look upon.                 So they kept us close till nigh on noon,                  And then they rang the bell,                And the Warders with their jingling keys                  Opened each listening cell,                And down the iron stair we tramped,                  Each from his separate Hell.                 Out into God's sweet air we went,                  But not in wonted way,                For this man's face was white with fear,                  And that man's face was grey,                And I never saw sad men who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw sad men who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  We prisoners called the sky,                And at every careless cloud that passed                  In happy freedom by.                 But there were those amongst us all                  Who walked with downcast head,                And knew that, had each got his due,                  They should have died instead:                He had but killed a thing that lived                  Whilst they had killed the dead.                 For he who sins a second time                  Wakes a dead soul to pain,                And draws it from its spotted shroud,                  And makes it bleed again,                And makes it bleed great gouts of blood                  And makes it bleed in vain!                 Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb                  With crooked arrows starred,                Silently we went round and round                  The slippery asphalte yard;                Silently we went round and round,                  And no man spoke a word.                 Silently we went round and round,                  And through each hollow mind                The memory of dreadful things                  Rushed like a dreadful wind,                An Horror stalked before each man,                  And terror crept behind.                 The Warders strutted up and down,                  And kept their herd of brutes,                Their uniforms were spick and span,                  And they wore their Sunday suits,                But we knew the work they had been at                  By the quicklime on their boots.                 For where a grave had opened wide,                  There was no grave at all:                Only a stretch of mud and sand                  By the hideous prison-wall,                And a little heap of burning lime,                  That the man should have his pall.                 For he has a pall, this wretched man,                  Such as few men can claim:                Deep down below a prison-yard,                  Naked for greater shame,                He lies, with fetters on each foot,                  Wrapt in a sheet of flame!                 And all the while the burning lime                  Eats flesh and bone away,                It eats the brittle bone by night,                  And the soft flesh by the day,                It eats the flesh and bones by turns,                  But it eats the heart alway.                 For three long years they will not sow                  Or root or seedling there:                For three long years the unblessed spot                  Will sterile be and bare,                And look upon the wondering sky                  With unreproachful stare.                 They think a murderer's heart would taint                  Each simple seed they sow.                It is not true!  God's kindly earth                  Is kindlier than men know,                And the red rose would but blow more red,                  The white rose whiter blow.                 Out of his mouth a red, red rose!                  Out of his heart a white!                For who can say by what strange way,                  Christ brings his will to light,                Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore                  Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?                 But neither milk-white rose nor red                  May bloom in prison air;                The shard, the pebble, and the flint,                  Are what they give us there:                For flowers have been known to heal                  A common man's despair.                 So never will wine-red rose or white,                  Petal by petal, fall                On that stretch of mud and sand that lies                  By the hideous prison-wall,                To tell the men who tramp the yard                  That God's Son died for all.                 Yet though the hideous prison-wall                  Still hems him round and round,                And a spirit may not walk by night                  That is with fetters bound,                And a spirit may but weep that lies                  In such unholy ground,                 He is at peace--this wretched man--                  At peace, or will be soon:                There is no thing to make him mad,                  Nor does Terror walk at noon,                For the lampless Earth in which he lies                  Has neither Sun nor Moon.                 They hanged him as a beast is hanged:                  They did not even toll                A requiem that might have brought                  Rest to his startled soul,                But hurriedly they took him out,                  And hid him in a hole.                 They stripped him of his canvas clothes,                  And gave him to the flies;                They mocked the swollen purple throat                  And the stark and staring eyes:                And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud                  In which their convict lies.                 The Chaplain would not kneel to pray                  By his dishonored grave:                Nor mark it with that blessed Cross                  That Christ for sinners gave,                Because the man was one of those                  Whom Christ came down to save.                 Yet all is well; he has but passed                  To Life's appointed bourne:                And alien tears will fill for him                  Pity's long-broken urn,                For his mourner will be outcast men,                  And outcasts always mourn.                   V.                 I know not whether Laws be right,                  Or whether Laws be wrong;                All that we know who lie in gaol                  Is that the wall is strong;                And that each day is like a year,                  A year whose days are long.                 But this I know, that every Law                  That men have made for Man,                Since first Man took his brother's life,                  And the sad world began,                But straws the wheat and saves the chaff                  With a most evil fan.                 This too I know--and wise it were                  If each could know the same--                That every prison that men build                  Is built with bricks of shame,                And bound with bars lest Christ should see                  How men their brothers maim.                 With bars they blur the gracious moon,                  And blind the goodly sun:                And they do well to hide their Hell,                  For in it things are done                That Son of God nor son of Man                  Ever should look upon!                 The vilest deeds like poison weeds                  Bloom well in prison-air:                It is only what is good in Man                  That wastes and withers there:                Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,                  And the Warder is Despair                 For they starve the little frightened child                  Till it weeps both night and day:                And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,                  And gibe the old and grey,                And some grow mad, and all grow bad,                And none a word may say.                 Each narrow cell in which we dwell                  Is a foul and dark latrine,                And the fetid breath of living Death                  Chokes up each grated screen,                And all, but Lust, is turned to dust                  In Humanity's machine.                 The brackish water that we drink                  Creeps with a loathsome slime,                And the bitter bread they weigh in scales                  Is full of chalk and lime,                And Sleep will not lie down, but walks                  Wild-eyed and cries to Time.                 But though lean Hunger and green Thirst                  Like asp with adder fight,                We have little care of prison fare,                  For what chills and kills outright                Is that every stone one lifts by day                  Becomes one's heart by night.                 With midnight always in one's heart,                  And twilight in one's cell,                We turn the crank, or tear the rope,                  Each in his separate Hell,                And the silence is more awful far                  Than the sound of a brazen bell.                 And never a human voice comes near                  To speak a gentle word:                And the eye that watches through the door                  Is pitiless and hard:                And by all forgot, we rot and rot,                  With soul and body marred.                 And thus we rust Life's iron chain                  Degraded and alone:                And some men curse, and some men weep,                  And some men make no moan:                But God's eternal Laws are kind                  And break the heart of stone.                 And every human heart that breaks,                  In prison-cell or yard,                Is as that broken box that gave                  Its treasure to the Lord,                And filled the unclean leper's house                  With the scent of costliest nard.                 Ah! happy day they whose hearts can break                  And peace of pardon win!                How else may man make straight his plan                  And cleanse his soul from Sin?                How else but through a broken heart                  May Lord Christ enter in?                 And he of the swollen purple throat.                  And the stark and staring eyes,                Waits for the holy hands that took                  The Thief to Paradise;                And a broken and a contrite heart                  The Lord will not despise.                 The man in red who reads the Law                  Gave him three weeks of life,                Three little weeks in which to heal                  His soul of his soul's strife,                And cleanse from every blot of blood                  The hand that held the knife.                 And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,                  The hand that held the steel:                For only blood can wipe out blood,                  And only tears can heal:                And the crimson stain that was of Cain                  Became Christ's snow-white seal.                   VI.                 In Reading gaol by Reading town                  There is a pit of shame,                And in it lies a wretched man                  Eaten by teeth of flame,                In burning winding-sheet he lies,                  And his grave has got no name.                 And there, till Christ call forth the dead,                  In silence let him lie:                No need to waste the foolish tear,                  Or heave the windy sigh:                The man had killed the thing he loved,                  And so he had to die.                 And all men kill the thing they love,                  By all let this be heard,                Some do it with a bitter look,                  Some with a flattering word,                The coward does it with a kiss,                  The brave man with a sword!      Version Two                                  I                 He did not wear his scarlet coat,                  For blood and wine are red,                And blood and wine were on his hands                  When they found him with the dead,                The poor dead woman whom he loved,                  And murdered in her bed.                 He walked amongst the Trial Men                  In a suit of shabby gray;                A cricket cap was on his head,                  And his step seemed light and gay;                But I never saw a man who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw a man who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  Which prisoners call the sky,                And at every drifting cloud that went                  With sails of silver by.                 I walked, with other souls in pain,                  Within another ring,                And was wondering if the man had done                  A great or little thing,                When a voice behind me whispered low,                  ""That fellow's got to swing.""                 Dear Christ! the very prison walls                  Suddenly seemed to reel,                And the sky above my head became                  Like a casque of scorching steel;                And, though I was a soul in pain,                  My pain I could not feel.                 I only knew what haunted thought                  Quickened his step, and why                He looked upon the garish day                  With such a wistful eye;                The man had killed the thing he loved,                  And so he had to die.                 Yet each man kills the thing he loves,                  By each let this be heard,                Some do it with a bitter look,                  Some with a flattering word,                The coward does it with a kiss,                  The brave man with a sword!                 Some kill their love when they are young,                  And some when they are old;                Some strangle with the hands of Lust,                  Some with the hands of Gold:                The kindest use a knife, because                  The dead so soon grow cold.                 Some love too little, some too long,                  Some sell, and others buy;                Some do the deed with many tears,                  And some without a sigh:                For each man kills the thing he loves,                  Yet each man does not die.                 He does not die a death of shame                  On a day of dark disgrace,                Nor have a noose about his neck,                  Nor a cloth upon his face,                Nor drop feet foremost through the floor                  Into an empty space.                 He does not sit with silent men                  Who watch him night and day;                Who watch him when he tries to weep,                  And when he tries to pray;                Who watch him lest himself should rob                  The prison of its prey.                 He does not wake at dawn to see                  Dread figures throng his room,                The shivering Chaplain robed in white,                  The Sheriff stern with gloom,                And the Governor all in shiny black,                  With the yellow face of Doom.                 He does not rise in piteous haste                  To put on convict-clothes,                While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes                  Each new and nerve-twitched pose,                Fingering a watch whose little ticks                  Are like horrible hammer-blows.                 He does not feel that sickening thirst                  That sands one's throat, before                The hangman with his gardener's gloves                  Comes through the padded door,                And binds one with three leathern thongs,                That the throat may thirst no more.                 He does not bend his head to hear                  The Burial Office read,                Nor, while the anguish of his soul                  Tells him he is not dead,                Cross his own coffin, as he moves                  Into the hideous shed.                 He does not stare upon the air                  Through a little roof of glass:                He does not pray with lips of clay                  For his agony to pass;                Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek                  The kiss of Caiaphas.                                   II                 Six weeks the guardsman walked the yard,                  In the suit of shabby gray:                His cricket cap was on his head,                  And his step was light and gay,                But I never saw a man who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw a man who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  Which prisoners call the sky,                And at every wandering cloud that trailed                  Its ravelled fleeces by.                 He did not wring his hands, as do                  Those witless men who dare                To try to rear the changeling Hope                  In the cave of black Despair:                He only looked upon the sun,                  And drank the morning air.                 He did not wring his hands nor weep,                  Nor did he peek or pine,                But he drank the air as though it held                  Some healthful anodyne;                With open mouth he drank the sun                  As though it had been wine!                 And I and all the souls in pain,                  Who tramped the other ring,                Forgot if we ourselves had done                  A great or little thing,                And watched with gaze of dull amaze                  The man who had to swing.                 For strange it was to see him pass                  With a step so light and gay,                And strange it was to see him look                  So wistfully at the day,                And strange it was to think that he                  Had such a debt to pay.                 The oak and elm have pleasant leaves                  That in the spring-time shoot:                But grim to see is the gallows-tree,                  With its alder-bitten root,                And, green or dry, a man must die                  Before it bears its fruit!                 The loftiest place is the seat of grace                  For which all worldlings try:                But who would stand in hempen band                  Upon a scaffold high,                And through a murderer's collar take                  His last look at the sky?                 It is sweet to dance to violins                  When Love and Life are fair:                To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes                  Is delicate and rare:                But it is not sweet with nimble feet                  To dance upon the air!                 So with curious eyes and sick surmise                  We watched him day by day,                And wondered if each one of us                  Would end the self-same way,                For none can tell to what red Hell                  His sightless soul may stray.                 At last the dead man walked no more                  Amongst the Trial Men,                And I knew that he was standing up                  In the black dock's dreadful pen,                And that never would I see his face                  For weal or woe again.                 Like two doomed ships that pass in storm                  We had crossed each other's way:                But we made no sign, we said no word,                  We had no word to say;                For we did not meet in the holy night,                  But in the shameful day.                 A prison wall was round us both,                  Two outcast men we were:                The world had thrust us from its heart,                  And God from out His care:                And the iron gin that waits for Sin                  Had caught us in its snare.                               III                 In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,                  And the dripping wall is high,                So it was there he took the air                  Beneath the leaden sky,                And by each side a warder walked,                  For fear the man might die.                 Or else he sat with those who watched                  His anguish night and day;                Who watched him when he rose to weep,                  And when he crouched to pray;                Who watched him lest himself should rob                  Their scaffold of its prey.                 The Governor was strong upon                  The Regulations Act:                The Doctor said that Death was but                  A scientific fact:                And twice a day the Chaplain called,                  And left a little tract.                 And twice a day he smoked his pipe,                  And drank his quart of beer:                His soul was resolute, and held                  No hiding-place for fear;                He often said that he was glad                  The hangman's day was near.                 But why he said so strange a thing                  No warder dared to ask:                For he to whom a watcher's doom                  Is given as his task,                Must set a lock upon his lips,                  And make his face a mask.                 Or else he might be moved, and try                  To comfort or console:                And what should Human Pity do                  Pent up in Murderers' Hole?                What word of grace in such a place                  Could help a brother's soul?                 With slouch and swing around the ring                  We trod the Fools' Parade!                We did not care: we knew we were                  The Devils' Own Brigade:                And shaven head and fe"|2
82|"et of lead                  Make a merry masquerade.                 We tore the tarry rope to shreds                  With blunt and bleeding nails;                We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,                  And cleaned the shining rails:                And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,                  And clattered with the pails.                 We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,                  We turned the dusty drill:                We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,                  And sweated on the mill:                But in the heart of every man                  Terror was lying still.                 So still it lay that every day                  Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:                And we forgot the bitter lot                  That waits for fool and knave,                Till once, as we tramped in from work,                  We passed an open grave.                 With yawning mouth the horrid hole                  Gaped for a living thing;                The very mud cried out for blood                  To the thirsty asphalte ring:                And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair                  The fellow had to swing.                 Right in we went, with soul intent                  On Death and Dread and Doom:                The hangman, with his little bag,                  Went shuffling through the gloom:                And I trembled as I groped my way                  Into my numbered tomb.                 That night the empty corridors                  Were full of forms of Fear,                And up and down the iron town                  Stole feet we could not hear,                And through the bars that hide the stars                  White faces seemed to peer.                 He lay as one who lies and dreams                  In a pleasant meadow-land,                The watchers watched him as he slept,                  And could not understand                How one could sleep so sweet a sleep                  With a hangman close at hand.                 But there is no sleep when men must weep                  Who never yet have wept:                So we- the fool, the fraud, the knave-                  That endless vigil kept,                And through each brain on hands of pain                  Another's terror crept.                 Alas! it is a fearful thing                  To feel another's guilt!                For, right within, the sword of Sin                  Pierced to its poisoned hilt,                And as molten lead were the tears we shed                  For the blood we had not spilt.                 The warders with their shoes of felt                  Crept by each padlocked door,                And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,                  Gray figures on the floor,                And wondered why men knelt to pray                  Who never prayed before.                 All through the night we knelt and prayed,                  Mad mourners of a corse!                The troubled plumes of midnight shook                  Like the plumes upon a hearse:                And as bitter wine upon a sponge                  Was the savour of Remorse.                 The gray cock crew, the red cock crew,                  But never came the day:                And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,                  In the corners where we lay:                And each evil sprite that walks by night                  Before us seemed to play.                 They glided past, the glided fast,                  Like travellers through a mist:                They mocked the moon in a rigadoon                  Of delicate turn and twist,                And with formal pace and loathsome grace                  The phantoms kept their tryst.                 With mop and mow, we saw them go,                  Slim shadows hand in hand:                About, about, in ghostly rout                  They trod a saraband:                And the damned grotesques made arabesques,                  Like the wind upon the sand!                 With the pirouettes of marionettes,                  They tripped on pointed tread:                But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,                  As their grisly masque they led,                And loud they sang, and long they sang,                  For they sang to wake the dead.                 ""Oho!"" they cried, ""the world is wide,                  But fettered limbs go lame!                And once, or twice, to throw the dice                  Is a gentlemanly game,                But he does not win who plays with Sin                  In the secret House of Shame.""                 No things of air these antics were,                  That frolicked with such glee:                To men whose lives were held in gyves,                  And whose feet might not go free,                Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,                  Most terrible to see.                 Around, around, they waltzed and wound;                  Some wheeled in smirking pairs;                With the mincing step of a demirep                  Some sidled up the stairs:                And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,                  Each helped us at our prayers.                 The morning wind began to moan,                  But still the night went on:                Through its giant loom the web of gloom                  Crept till each thread was spun:                And, as we prayed, we grew afraid                  Of the Justice of the Sun.                 The moaning wind went wandering round                  The weeping prison wall:                Till like a wheel of turning steel                  We felt the minutes crawl:                O moaning wind! what had we done                  To have such a seneschal?                 At last I saw the shadowed bars,                  Like a lattice wrought in lead,                Move right across the whitewashed wall                  That faced my three-plank bed,                And I knew that somewhere in the world                  God's dreadful dawn was red.                 At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,                  At seven all was still,                But the sough and swing of a mighty wing                  The prison seemed to fill,                For the Lord of Death with icy breath                  Had entered in to kill.                 He did not pass in purple pomp,                  Nor ride a moon-white steed.                Three yards of cord and a sliding board                  Are all the gallows' need:                So with rope of shame the Herald came                  To do the secret deed.                 We were as men who through a fen                  Of filthy darkness grope:                We did not dare to breathe a prayer,                  Or to give our anguish scope:                Something was dead in each of us,                  And what was dead was Hope.                 For Man's grim Justice goes its way                  And will not swerve aside:                It slays the weak, it slays the strong,                  It has a deadly stride:                With iron heel it slays the strong                  The monstrous parricide!                 We waited for the stroke of eight:                  Each tongue was thick with thirst:                For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate                  That makes a man accursed,                And Fate will use a running noose                  For the best man and the worst.                 We had no other thing to do,                  Save to wait for the sign to come:                So, like things of stone in a valley lone,                  Quiet we sat and dumb:                But each man's heart beat thick and quick,                  Like a madman on a drum!                 With sudden shock the prison-clock                  Smote on the shivering air,                And from all the gaol rose up a wail                  Of impotent despair,                Like the sound the frightened marshes hear                  From some leper in his lair.                 And as one sees most fearful things                  In the crystal of a dream,                We saw the greasy hempen rope                  Hooked to the blackened beam,                And heard the prayer the hangman's snare                  Strangled into a scream.                 And all the woe that moved him so                  That he gave that bitter cry,                And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,                  None knew so well as I:                For he who lives more lives than one                  More deaths that one must die.                                IV                 There is no chapel on the day                  On which they hang a man:                The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,                  Or his face is far too wan,                Or there is that written in his eyes                  Which none should look upon.                 So they kept us close till nigh on noon,                  And then they rang the bell,                And the warders with their jingling keys                  Opened each listening cell,                And down the iron stair we tramped,                  Each from his separate Hell.                 Out into God's sweet air we went,                  But not in wonted way,                For this man's face was white with fear,                  And that man's face was gray,                And I never saw sad men who looked                  So wistfully at the day.                 I never saw sad men who looked                  With such a wistful eye                Upon that little tent of blue                  We prisoners called the sky,                And at every happy cloud that passed                  In such strange freedom by.                 But there were those amongst us all                  Who walked with downcast head,                And knew that, had each got his due,                  They should have died instead:                He had but killed a thing that lived,                  Whilst they had killed the dead.                 For he who sins a second time                  Wakes a dead soul to pain,                And draws it from its spotted shroud                  And makes it bleed again,                And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,                  And makes it bleed in vain!                 Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb                  With crooked arrows starred,                Silently we went round and round                  The slippery asphalte yard;                Silently we went round and round,                  And no man spoke a word.                 Silently we went round and round,                  And through each hollow mind                The Memory of dreadful things                  Rushed like a dreadful wind,                And Horror stalked before each man,                  And Terror crept behind.                 The warders strutted up and down,                  And watched their herd of brutes,                Their uniforms were spick and span,                  And they wore their Sunday suits,                But we knew the work they had been at,                  By the quicklime on their boots.                 For where a grave had opened wide,                  There was no grave at all:                Only a stretch of mud and sand                  By the hideous prison-wall,                And a little heap of burning lime,                  That the man should have his pall.                 For he has a pall, this wretched man,                  Such as few men can claim:                Deep down below a prison-yard,                  Naked, for greater shame,                He lies, with fetters on each foot,                  Wrapt in a sheet of flame!                 And all the while the burning lime                  Eats flesh and bone away,                It eats the brittle bones by night,                  And the soft flesh by day,                It eats the flesh and bone by turns,                  But it eats the heart alway.                 For three long years they will not sow                  Or root or seedling there:                For three long years the unblessed spot                  Will sterile be and bare,                And look upon the wondering sky                  With unreproachful stare.                 They think a murderer's heart would taint                  Each simple seed they sow.                It is not true! God's kindly earth                  Is kindlier than men know,                And the red rose would but glow more red,                  The white rose whiter blow.                 Out of his mouth a red, red rose!                  Out of his heart a white!                For who can say by what strange way,                  Christ brings His will to light,                Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore                  Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?                 But neither milk-white rose nor red                  May bloom in prison air;                The shard, the pebble, and the flint,                  Are what they give us there:                For flowers have been known to heal                  A common man's despair.                 So never will wine-red rose or white,                  Petal by petal, fall                On that stretch of mud and sand that lies                  By the hideous prison-wall,                To tell the men who tramp the yard                  That God's Son died for all.                 Yet though the hideous prison-wall                  Still hems him round and round,                And a spirit may not walk by night                  That is with fetters bound,                And a spirit may but weep that lies                  In such unholy ground,                 He is at peace- this wretched man-                  At peace, or will be soon:                There is no thing to make him mad,                  Nor does Terror walk at noon,                For the lampless Earth in which he lies                  Has neither Sun nor Moon.                 They hanged him as a beast is hanged:                  They did not even toll                A requiem that might have brought                  Rest to his startled soul,                But hurriedly they took him out,                  And hid him in a hole.                 The warders stripped him of his clothes,                  And gave him to the flies:                They mocked the swollen purple throat,                  And the stark and staring eyes:                And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud                  In which the convict lies.                 The Chaplain would not kneel to pray                  By his dishonoured grave:                Nor mark it with that blessed Cross                  That Christ for sinners gave,                Because the man was one of those                  Whom Christ came down to save.                 Yet all is well; he has but passed                  To  Life's appointed bourne:                And alien tears will fill for him                  Pity's long-broken urn,                For his mourners be outcast men,                  And outcasts always mourn.                                V                 I know not whether Laws be right,                  Or whether Laws be wrong;                All that we know who lie in gaol                  Is that the wall is strong;                And that each day is like a year,                  A year whose days are long.                 But this I know, that every Law                  That men have made for Man,                Since first Man took His brother's life,                  And the sad world began,                But straws the wheat and saves the chaff                  With a most evil fan.                 This too I know- and wise it were                  If each could know the same-                That every prison that men build                  Is built with bricks of shame,                And bound with bars lest Christ should see                  How men their brothers maim.                 With bars they blur the gracious moon,                  And blind the goodly sun:                And the do well to hide their Hell,                  For in it things are done                That Son of things nor son of Man                  Ever should look upon!                 The vilest deeds like poison weeds                  Bloom well in prison-air:                It is only what is good in Man                  That wastes and withers there:                Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,                  And the warder is Despair.                 For they starve the little frightened child                  Till it weeps both night and day:                And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,                  And gibe the old and gray,                And some grow mad, and all grow bad,                  And none a word may say.                 Each narrow cell in which we dwell                  Is a foul and dark latrine,                And the fetid breath of living Death                  Chokes up each grated screen,                And all, but Lust, is turned to dust                  In Humanity's machine.                 The brackish water that we drink                  Creeps with a loathsome slime,                And the bitter bread they weigh in scales                  Is full of chalk and lime,                And Sleep will not lie down, but walks                  Wild-eyed, and cries to Time.                 But though lean Hunger and green Thirst                  Like asp with adder fight,                We have little care of prison fare,                  For what chills and kills outright                Is that every stone one lifts by day                  Becomes one's heart by night.                 With midnight always in one's heart,                  And twilight in one's cell,                We turn the crank, or tear the rope,                  Each in his separate Hell,                And the silence is more awful far                  Than the sound of a brazen bell.                 And never a human voice comes near                  To speak a gentle word:                And the eye that watches through the door                  Is pitiless and hard:                And by all forgot, we rot and rot,                  With soul and body marred.                 And thus we rust Life's iron chain                  Degraded and alone:                And some men curse, and some men weep,                  And some men make no moan:                But God's eternal Laws are kind                  And break the heart of stone.                 And every human heart that breaks,                  In prison-cell or yard,                Is as that broken box that gave                  Its treasure to the Lord,                And filled the unclean leper's house                  With the scent of costliest nard.                 Ah! happy they whose hearts can break                  And peace of pardon win!                How else may man make straight his plan                  And cleanse his soul from Sin?                How else but through a broken heart                  May Lord Christ enter in?                 And he of the swollen purple throat,                  And the stark and staring eyes,                Waits for the holy hands that took                  The Thief to Paradise;                And a broken and a contrite heart                  The Lord will not despise.                 The man in red who reads the Law                  Gave him three weeks of life,                Three little weeks in which to heal                  His soul of his soul's strife,                And cleanse from every blot of blood                  The hand that held the knife.                 And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,                  The hand that held the steel:                For only blood can wipe out blood,                  And only tears can heal:                And the crimson stain that was of Cain                  Became Christ's snow-white seal.                                VI                 In Reading gaol by Reading town                  There is a pit of shame,                And in it lies a wretched man                  Eaten by teeth of flame,                In a burning winding-sheet he lies,                  And his grave has got no name.                 And there, till Christ call forth the dead,                  In silence let him lie:                No need to waste the foolish tear,                  Or heave the windy sigh:                The man had killed the thing he loved,                  And so he had to die.                 And all men kill the thing they love,                  By all let this be heard,                Some do it with a bitter look,                  Some with a flattering word,                The coward does it with a kiss,                  The brave man with a sword!                  THE END   PHRASES AND PHILOSOPHIES FOR THE USE OF THE YOUNG    The first duty in life is to be as artificial as possible.  What the second duty is no one has as yet discovered.  Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attractiveness of others.  If the poor only had profiles there would be no difficulty in solving the problem of poverty.  Those who see any difference between soul and body have neither.  A really well-made buttonhole is the only link between Art and Nature.  Religions die when they are proved to be true.  Science is the record of dead religions.  The well-bred contradict other people.  The wise contradict themselves.  Nothing that actually occurs is of the smallest importance.  Dulness is the coming of age of seriousness.  In all unimportant matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential. In all important matters, style, not sincerity, is the essential.  If one tells the truth one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out.  Pleasure is the only thing one should live for.  Nothing ages like happiness.  It is only by not paying one's bills that one can hope to live in the memory of the commercial classes.  No crime is vulgar, but all vulgarity is crime.  Vulgarity is the conduct of others.  Only the shallow know themselves.  Time is waste of money.  One should always be a little improbable.  There is a fatality about all good resolutions.  They are invariably made too soon.  The only way to atone for being occasionally a little overdressed is by being always absolutely overeducated.  To be premature is to be perfect.  Any preoccupation with ideas of what is right or wrong in conduct shows an arrested intellectual development.  Ambition is the last refuge of the failure.  A truth ceases to be true when more than one person believes in it.  In examinations the foolish ask questions that the wise cannot answer.  Greek dress was in its essence inartistic.  Nothing should reveal the body but the body.  One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.  It is only the superficial qualities that last.  Man's deeper nature is soon found out.  Industry is the root of all ugliness.  The ages live in history through their anachronisms.  It is only the gods who taste of death.  Apollo has passed away, but Hyacinth, whom men say he slew, lives on.  Nero and Narcissus are always with us.  The old believe everything:  the middle-aged suspect everything; the young know everything.  The condition of perfection is idleness:  the aim of perfection is youth.  Only the great masters of style ever succeeded in being obscure.  There is something tragic about the enormous number of young men there are in England at the present moment who start life with perfect profiles, and end by adopting some useful profession.  To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.    MRS. LANGTRY AS HESTER GRAZEBROOK    It is only in the best Greek gems, on the silver coins of Syracuse, or among the marble figures of the Parthenon frieze, that one can find the ideal representation of the marvellous beauty of that face which laughed through the leaves last night as Hester Grazebrook.  Pure Greek it is, with the grave low forehead, the exquisitely arched brow; the noble chiselling of the mouth, shaped as if it were the mouthpiece of an instrument of music; the supreme and splendid curve of the cheek; the augustly pillared throat which bears it all:  it is Greek, because the lines which compose it are so definite and so strong, and yet so exquisitely harmonized that the effect is one of simple loveliness purely:  Greek, because its essence and its quality, as is the quality of music and of architecture, is that of beauty based on absolutely mathematical laws.  But while art remains dumb and immobile in its passionless serenity, with the beauty of this face it is different:  the grey eyes lighten into blue or deepen into violet as fancy succeeds fancy; the lips become flower-like in laughter or, tremulous as a bird's wing, mould themselves at last into the strong and bitter moulds of pain or scorn.  And then motion comes, and the statue wakes into life.  But the life is not the ordinary life of common days; it is life with a new value given to it, the value of art: and the charm to me of Hester Grazebrook's acting in the first scene of the play last night was that mingling of classic grace with absolute reality which is the secret of all beautiful art, of the plastic work of the Greeks and of the pictures of Jean Francois Millet equally.  I do not think that the sovereignty and empire of women's beauty has at all passed away, though we may no longer go to war for them as the Greeks did for the daughter of Leda.  The greatest empire still remains for them--the empire of art.  And, indeed, this wonderful face, seen last night for the first time in America, has filled and permeated with the pervading image of its type the whole of our modern art in England.  Last century it was the romantic type which dominated in art, the type loved by Reynolds and Gainsborough, of wonderful contrasts of colour, of exquisite and varying charm of expression, but without that definite plastic feeling which divides classic from romantic work.  This type degenerated into mere facile prettiness in the hands of lesser masters, and, in protest against it, was created by the hands of the Pre-Raphaelites a new type, with its rare combination of Greek form with Florentine mysticism.  But this mysticism becomes over- strained and a burden, rather than an aid to expression, and a desire for the pure Hellenic joy and serenity came in its place; and in all our modern work, in the paintings of such men as Albert Moore and Leighton and Whistler, we can trace the influence of this single face giving fresh life and inspiration in the form of a new artistic ideal.    SLAVES OF FASHION    Miss Leffler-Arnim's statement, in a lecture delivered recently at St. Saviour's Hospital, that ""she had heard of instances where ladies were so determined not to exceed the fashionable measurement that they had actually held on to a cross-bar while their maids fastened the fifteen-inch corset,"" has excited a good deal of incredulity, but there is nothing really improbable in it.  From the sixteenth century to our own day there is hardly any form of torture that has not been inflicted on girls, and endured by women, in obedience to the dictates of an unreasonable and monstrous Fashion.  ""In order to obtain a real Spanish figure,"" says Montaigne, ""what a Gehenna of suffering will not women endure, drawn in and compressed by great coches entering the flesh; nay, sometimes they even die thereof!""  ""A few days after my arrival at school,"" Mrs. Somerville tells us in her memoirs, ""although perfectly straight and well made, I was enclosed in stiff stays, with a steel busk in front; while above my frock, bands drew my shoulders back till the shoulder-blades met.  Then a steel rod with a semi-circle, which went under my chin, was clasped to the steel busk in my stays.  In this constrained state I and most of the younger girls had to prepare our lessons""; and in the life of Miss Edgeworth w"|2
83|"e read that, being sent to a certain fashionable establishment, ""she underwent all the usual tortures of back- boards, iron collars and dumbs, and also (because she was a very tiny person) the unusual one of being hung by the neck to draw out the muscles and increase the growth,"" a signal failure in her case. Indeed, instances of absolute mutilation and misery are so common in the past that it is unnecessary to multiply them; but it is really sad to think that in our own day a civilized woman can hang on to a cross-bar while her maid laces her waist into a fifteen- inch circle.  To begin with, the waist is not a circle at all, but an oval; nor can there be any greater error than to imagine that an unnaturally small waist gives an air of grace, or even of slightness, to the whole figure.  Its effect, as a rule, is simply to exaggerate the width of the shoulders and the hips; and those whose figures possess that stateliness which is called stoutness by the vulgar, convert what is a quality into a defect by yielding to the silly edicts of Fashion on the subject of tight-lacing.  The fashionable English waist, also, is not merely far too small, and consequently quite out of proportion to the rest of the figure, but it is worn far too low down.  I use the expression ""worn"" advisedly, for a waist nowadays seems to be regarded as an article of apparel to be put on when and where one likes.  A long waist always implies shortness of the lower limbs, and, from the artistic point of view, has the effect of diminishing the height; and I am glad to see that many of the most charming women in Paris are returning to the idea of the Directoire style of dress.  This style is not by any means perfect, but at least it has the merit of indicating the proper position of the waist.  I feel quite sure that all English women of culture and position will set their faces against such stupid and dangerous practices as are related by Miss Leffler-Arnim.  Fashion's motto is:  Il faut souffrir pour etre belle; but the motto of art and of common-sense is:  Il faut etre bete pour souffrir.  Talking of Fashion, a critic in the Pall Mall Gazelle expresses his surprise that I should have allowed an illustration of a hat, covered with ""the bodies of dead birds,"" to appear in the first number of the Woman's World; and as I have received many letters on the subject, it is only right that I should state my exact position in the matter.  Fashion is such an essential part of the mundus muliebris of our day, that it seems to me absolutely necessary that its growth, development, and phases should be duly chronicled; and the historical and practical value of such a record depends entirely upon its perfect fidelity to fact.  Besides, it is quite easy for the children of light to adapt almost any fashionable form of dress to the requirements of utility and the demands of good taste.  The Sarah Bernhardt tea-gown, for instance, figured in the present issue, has many good points about it, and the gigantic dress-improver does not appear to me to be really essential to the mode; and though the Postillion costume of the fancy dress ball is absolutely detestable in its silliness and vulgarity, the so-called Late Georgian costume in the same plate is rather pleasing.  I must, however, protest against the idea that to chronicle the development of Fashion implies any approval of the particular forms that Fashion may adopt.    WOMAN'S DRESS    The ""Girl Graduate"" must of course have precedence, not merely for her sex but for her sanity:  her letter is extremely sensible.  She makes two points:  that high heels are a necessity for any lady who wishes to keep her dress clean from the Stygian mud of our streets, and that without a tight corset the ordinary number of petticoats and etceteras' cannot be properly or conveniently held up.  Now, it is quite true that as long as the lower garments are suspended from the hips a corset is an absolute necessity; the mistake lies in not suspending all apparel from the shoulders.  In the latter case a corset becomes useless, the body is left free and unconfined for respiration and motion, there is more health, and consequently more beauty.  Indeed all the most ungainly and uncomfortable articles of dress that fashion has ever in her folly prescribed, not the tight corset merely, but the farthingale, the vertugadin, the hoop, the crinoline, and that modern monstrosity the so-called ""dress improver"" also, all of them have owed their origin to the same error, the error of not seeing that it is from the shoulders, and from the shoulders only, that all garments should be hung.  And as regards high heels, I quite admit that some additional height to the shoe or boot is necessary if long gowns are to be worn in the street; but what I object to is that the height should be given to the heel only, and not to the sole of the foot also. The modern high-heeled boot is, in fact, merely the clog of the time of Henry VI., with the front prop left out, and its inevitable effect is to throw the body forward, to shorten the steps, and consequently to produce that want of grace which always follows want of freedom.  Why should clogs be despised?  Much art has been expended on clogs. They have been made of lovely woods, and delicately inlaid with ivory, and with mother-of-pearl.  A clog might be a dream of beauty, and, if not too high or too heavy, most comfortable also. But if there be any who do not like clogs, let them try some adaptation of the trouser of the Turkish lady, which is loose round the limb and tight at the ankle.  The ""Girl Graduate,"" with a pathos to which I am not insensible, entreats me not to apotheosize ""that awful, befringed, beflounced, and bekilted divided skirt.""  Well, I will acknowledge that the fringes, the flounces, and the kilting do certainly defeat the whole object of the dress, which is that of ease and liberty; but I regard these things as mere wicked superfluities, tragic proofs that the divided skirt is ashamed of its own division.  The principle of the dress is good, and, though it is not by any means perfection, it is a step towards it.  Here I leave the ""Girl Graduate,"" with much regret, for Mr. Wentworth Huyshe.  Mr. Huyshe makes the old criticism that Greek dress is unsuited to our climate, and, to me the somewhat new assertion, that the men's dress of a hundred years ago was preferable to that of the second part of the seventeenth century, which I consider to have been the exquisite period of English costume.  Now, as regards the first of these two statements, I will say, to begin with, that the warmth of apparel does not depend really on the number of garments worn, but on the material of which they are made.  One of the chief faults of modern dress is that it is composed of far too many articles of clothing, most of which are of the wrong substance; but over a substratum of pure wool, such as is supplied by Dr. Jaeger under the modern German system, some modification of Greek costume is perfectly applicable to our climate, our country and our century.  This important fact has already been pointed out by Mr. E. W. Godwin in his excellent, though too brief handbook on Dress, contributed to the Health Exhibition.  I call it an important fact because it makes almost any form of lovely costume perfectly practicable in our cold climate.  Mr. Godwin, it is true, points out that the English ladies of the thirteenth century abandoned after some time the flowing garments of the early Renaissance in favour of a tighter mode, such as Northern Europe seems to demand.  This I quite admit, and its significance; but what I contend, and what I am sure Mr. Godwin would agree with me in, is that the principles, the laws of Greek dress may be perfectly realized, even in a moderately tight gown with sleeves:  I mean the principle of suspending all apparel from the shoulders, and of relying for beauty of effect not on the stiff ready-made ornaments of the modern milliner--the bows where there should be no bows, and the flounces where there should be no flounces--but on the exquisite play of light and line that one gets from rich and rippling folds.  I am not proposing any antiquarian revival of an ancient costume, but trying merely to point out the right laws of dress, laws which are dictated by art and not by archaeology, by science and not by fashion; and just as the best work of art in our days is that which combines classic grace with absolute reality, so from a continuation of the Greek principles of beauty with the German principles of health will come, I feel certain, the costume of the future.  And now to the question of men's dress, or rather to Mr. Huyshe's claim of the superiority, in point of costume, of the last quarter of the eighteenth century over the second quarter of the seventeenth.  The broad-brimmed hat of 1640 kept the rain of winter and the glare of summer from the face; the same cannot be said of the hat of one hundred years ago, which, with its comparatively narrow brim and high crown, was the precursor of the modern ""chimney-pot"":  a wide turned-down collar is a healthier thing than a strangling stock, and a short cloak much more comfortable than a sleeved overcoat, even though the latter may have had ""three capes""; a cloak is easier to put on and off, lies lightly on the shoulder in summer, and wrapped round one in winter keeps one perfectly warm.  A doublet, again, is simpler than a coat and waistcoat; instead of two garments one has one; by not being open also it protects the chest better.  Short loose trousers are in every way to be preferred to the tight knee-breeches which often impede the proper circulation of the blood; and finally, the soft leather boots which could be worn above or below the knee, are more supple, and give consequently more freedom, than the stiff Hessian which Mr. Huyshe so praises. I say nothing about the question of grace and picturesqueness, for I suppose that no one, not even Mr. Huyshe, would prefer a maccaroni to a cavalier, a Lawrence to a Vandyke, or the third George to the first Charles; but for ease, warmth and comfort this seventeenth-century dress is infinitely superior to anything that came after it, and I do not think it is excelled by any preceding form of costume.  I sincerely trust that we may soon see in England some national revival of it.    MORE RADICAL IDEAS UPON DRESS REFORM    I have been much interested at reading the large amount of correspondence that has been called forth by my recent lecture on Dress.  It shows me that the subject of dress reform is one that is occupying many wise and charming people, who have at heart the principles of health, freedom, and beauty in costume, and I hope that ""H. B. T."" and ""Materfamilias"" will have all the real influence which their letters--excellent letters both of them-- certainly deserve.  I turn first to Mr. Huyshe's second letter, and the drawing that accompanies it; but before entering into any examination of the theory contained in each, I think I should state at once that I have absolutely no idea whether this gentleman wears his hair long or short, or his cuffs back or forward, or indeed what he is like at all.  I hope he consults his own comfort and wishes in everything which has to do with his dress, and is allowed to enjoy that individualism in apparel which he so eloquently claims for himself, and so foolishly tries to deny to others; but I really could not take Mr. Wentworth Huyshe's personal appearance as any intellectual basis for an investigation of the principles which should guide the costume of a nation.  I am not denying the force, or even the popularity, of the ""'Eave arf a brick"" school of criticism, but I acknowledge it does not interest me.  The gamin in the gutter may be a necessity, but the gamin in discussion is a nuisance.  So I will proceed at once to the real point at issue, the value of the late eighteenth-century costume over that worn in the second quarter of the seventeenth:  the relative merits, that is, of the principles contained in each.  Now, as regards the eighteenth-century costume, Mr. Wentworth Huyshe acknowledges that he has had no practical experience of it at all; in fact he makes a pathetic appeal to his friends to corroborate him in his assertion, which I do not question for a moment, that he has never been ""guilty of the eccentricity"" of wearing himself the dress which he proposes for general adoption by others.  There is something so naive and so amusing about this last passage in Mr. Huyshe's letter that I am really in doubt whether I am not doing him a wrong in regarding him as having any serious, or sincere, views on the question of a possible reform in dress; still, as irrespective of any attitude of Mr. Huyshe's in the matter, the subject is in itself an interesting one, I think it is worth continuing, particularly as I have myself worn this late eighteenth-century dress many times, both in public and in private, and so may claim to have a very positive right to speak on its comfort and suitability.  The particular form of the dress I wore was very similar to that given in Mr. Godwin's handbook, from a print of Northcote's, and had a certain elegance and grace about it which was very charming; still, I gave it up for these reasons:- After a further consideration of the laws of dress I saw that a doublet is a far simpler and easier garment than a coat and waistcoat, and, if buttoned from the shoulder, far warmer also, and that tails have no place in costume, except on some Darwinian theory of heredity; from absolute experience in the matter I found that the excessive tightness of knee-breeches is not really comfortable if one wears them constantly; and, in fact, I satisfied myself that the dress is not one founded on any real principles.  The broad-brimmed hat and loose cloak, which, as my object was not, of course, historical accuracy but modern ease, I had always worn with the costume in question, I have still retained, and find them most comfortable.  Well, although Mr. Huyshe has no real experience of the dress he proposes, he gives us a drawing of it, which he labels, somewhat prematurely, ""An ideal dress.""  An ideal dress of course it is not; ""passably picturesque,"" he says I may possibly think it; well, passably picturesque it may be, but not beautiful, certainly, simply because it is not founded on right principles, or, indeed, on any principles at all.  Picturesqueness one may get in a variety of ways; ugly things that are strange, or unfamiliar to us, for instance, may be picturesque, such as a late sixteenth-century costume, or a Georgian house.  Ruins, again, may be picturesque, but beautiful they never can be, because their lines are meaningless.  Beauty, in fact, is to be got only from the perfection of principles; and in ""the ideal dress"" of Mr. Huyshe there are no ideas or principles at all, much less the perfection of either.  Let us examine it, and see its faults; they are obvious to any one who desires more than a ""Fancy-dress ball"" basis for costume.  To begin with, the hat and boots are all wrong.  Whatever one wears on the extremities, such as the feet and head, should, for the sake of comfort, be made of a soft material, and for the sake of freedom should take its shape from the way one chooses to wear it, and not from any stiff, stereotyped design of hat or boot maker.  In a hat made on right principles one should be able to turn the brim up or down according as the day is dark or fair, dry or wet; but the hat brim of Mr. Huyshe's drawing is perfectly stiff, and does not give much protection to the face, or the possibility of any at all to the back of the head or the ears, in case of a cold east wind; whereas the bycocket, a hat made in accordance with the right laws, can be turned down behind and at the sides, and so give the same warmth as a hood.  The crown, again, of Mr. Huyshe's hat is far too high; a high crown diminishes the stature of a small person, and in the case of any one who is tall is a great inconvenience when one is getting in and out of hansoms and railway carriages, or passing under a street awning: in no case is it of any value whatsoever, and being useless it is of course against the principles of dress.  As regards the boots, they are not quite so ugly or so uncomfortable as the hat; still they are evidently made of stiff leather, as otherwise they would fall down to the ankle, whereas the boot should be made of soft leather always, and if worn high at all must be either laced up the front or carried well over the knee:  in the latter case one combines perfect freedom for walking together with perfect protection against rain, neither of which advantages a short stiff boot will ever give one, and when one is resting in the house the long soft boot can be turned down as the boot of 1640 was.  Then there is the overcoat:  now, what are the right principles of an overcoat?  To begin with, it should be capable of being easily put on or off, and worn over any kind of dress; consequently it should never have narrow sleeves, such as are shown in Mr. Huyshe's drawing.  If an opening or slit for the arm is required it should be made quite wide, and may be protected by a flap, as in that excellent overall the modern Inverness cape; secondly, it should not be too tight, as otherwise all freedom of walking is impeded.  If the young gentleman in the drawing buttons his overcoat he may succeed in being statuesque, though that I doubt very strongly, but he will never succeed in being swift; his super-totus is made for him on no principle whatsoever; a super- totus, or overall, should be capable of being worn long or short, quite loose or moderately tight, just as the wearer wishes; he should be able to have one arm free and one arm covered or both arms free or both arms covered, just as he chooses for his convenience in riding, walking, or driving; an overall again should never be heavy, and should always be warm:  lastly, it should be capable of being easily carried if one wants to take it off; in fact, its principles are those of freedom and comfort, and a cloak realizes them all, just as much as an overcoat of the pattern suggested by Mr. Huyshe violates them.  The knee-breeches are of course far too tight; any one who has worn them for any length of time--any one, in fact, whose views on the subject are not purely theoretical--will agree with me there; like everything else in the dress, they are a great mistake.  The substitution of the jacket for the coat and waistcoat of the period is a step in the right direction, which I am glad to see; it is, however, far too tight over the hips for any possible comfort. Whenever a jacket or doublet comes below the waist it should be slit at each side.  In the seventeenth century the skirt of the jacket was sometimes laced on by points and tags, so that it could be removed at will, sometimes it was merely left open at the sides: in each case it exemplified what are always the true principles of dress, I mean freedom and adaptability to circumstances.  Finally, as regards drawings of this kind, I would point out that there is absolutely no limit at all to the amount of ""passably picturesque"" costumes which can be either revived or invented for us; but that unless a costume is founded on principles and exemplified laws, it never can be of any real value to us in the reform of dress.  This particular drawing of Mr. Huyshe's, for instance, proves absolutely nothing, except that our grandfathers did not understand the proper laws of dress.  There is not a single rule of right costume which is not violated in it, for it gives us stiffness, tightness and discomfort instead of comfort, freedom and ease.  Now here, on the other hand, is a dress which, being founded on principles, can serve us as an excellent guide and model; it has been drawn for me, most kindly, by Mr. Godwin from the Duke of Newcastle's delightful book on horsemanship, a book which is one of our best authorities on our best era of costume.  I do not of course propose it necessarily for absolute imitation; that is not the way in which one should regard it; it is not, I mean, a revival of a dead costume, but a realization of living laws.  I give it as an example of a particular application of principles which are universally right.  This rationally dressed young man can turn his hat brim down if it rains, and his loose trousers and boots down if he is tired--that is, he can adapt his costume to circumstances; then he enjoys perfect freedom, the arms and legs are not made awkward or uncomfortable by the excessive tightness of narrow sleeves and knee-breeches, and the hips are left quite untrammelled, always an important point; and as regards comfort, his jacket is not too loose for warmth, nor too close for respiration; his neck is well protected without being strangled, and even his ostrich feathers, if any Philistine should object to them, are not merely dandyism, but fan him very pleasantly, I am sure, in summer, and when the weather is bad they are no doubt left at home, and his cloak taken out.  THE VALUE OF THE DRESS IS SIMPLY THAT EVERY SEPARATE ARTICLE OF IT EXPRESSES A LAW.  My young man is consequently apparelled with ideas, while Mr. Huyshe's young man is stiffened with facts; the latter teaches one nothing; from the former one learns everything.  I need hardly say that this dress is good, not because it is seventeenth century, but because it is constructed on the true principles of costume, just as a square lintel or pointed arch is good, not because one may be Greek and the other Gothic, but because each of them is the best method of spanning a certain-sized opening, or resisting a certain weight. The fact, however, that this dress was generally worn in England two centuries and a half ago shows at least this, that the right laws of dress have been understood and realized in our country, and so in our country may be realized and understood again.  As regards the absolute beauty of this dress and its meaning, I should like to say a few words more.  Mr. Wentworth Huyshe solemnly announces that ""he and those who think with him"" cannot permit this question of beauty to be imported into the question of dress; that he and those who think with him take ""practical views on the subject,"" and so on.  Well, I will not enter here into a discussion as to how far any one who does not take beauty and the value of beauty into account can claim to be practical at all.  The word practical is nearly always the last refuge of the uncivilized.  Of all misused words it is the most evilly treated.  But what I want to point out is that beauty is essentially organic; that is, it comes, not from without, but from within, not from any added prettiness, but from the perfection of its own being; and that consequently, as the body is beautiful, so all apparel that rightly clothes it must be beautiful also in its construction and in its lines.  I have no more desire to define ugliness than I have daring to define beauty; but still I would like to remind those who mock at beauty as being an unpractical thing of this fact, that an ugly thing is merely a thing that is badly made, or a thing that does not serve it purpose; that ugliness is want of fitness; that ugliness is failure; that ugliness is uselessness, such as ornament in the wrong place, while beauty, as some one finely said, is the purgation of all superfluities.  There is a divine economy about beauty; it gives us just what is needful and no more, whereas ugliness is always extravagant; ugliness is a spendthrift and wastes its material; in fine, ugliness--and I would commend this remark to Mr. Wentworth Huyshe--ugliness, as much in costume as in anything else, is always the sign that somebody has been unpractical.  So the costume of the future in England, if it is founded on the true laws of freedom, comfort, and adaptability to circumstances, cannot fail to be most beautiful also, because beauty is the sign always of the rightness of principles, the mystical seal that is set upon what is perfect, and upon what is perfect only.  As for your other correspondent, the first principle of dress that all garments should be hung from the shoulders and not from the waist seems to me to be generally approved of, although an ""Old Sailor"" declares that no sailors or athletes ever suspend their clothes from the shoulders, but always from the hips.  My own recollection of the river and running ground at Oxford--those two homes of Hellenism in our little Gothic town--is that the best runners and rowers (and my own college turned out many) wore always a tight jersey, with short drawers attached to it, the whole costume being woven in one piece.  As for sailors, it is true, I admit, and the bad custom seems to involve that constant ""hitching up"" of the lower garments which, however popular in transpontine dramas, cannot, I think, but be considered an extremely awkward habit; and as all awkwardness comes from discomfort of some kind, I trust that this point in our sailor's dress will be looked to in the coming reform of our navy, for, in spite of all protests, I hope we are about to reform everything, from torpedoes to top-hats, and from crinolettes to cruises.  Then as regards clogs, my suggestion of them seems to have aroused a great deal of terror.  Fashion in her high-heeled boots has screamed, and the dreadful word ""anachronism"" has been used.  Now, whatever is useful cannot be an anachronism.  Such a word is applicable only to the revival of some folly; and, besides, in the England of our own day clogs are still worn in many of our manufacturing towns, such as Oldham.  I fear that in Oldham they may not be dreams of beauty; in Oldham the art of inlaying them with ivory and with pearl may possibly be unknown; yet in Oldham they serve their purpose.  Nor is it so long since they were worn by the upper classes of this country generally.  Only a few days ago I had the pleasure of talking to a lady who remembered with affectionate regret the clogs of her girlhood; they were, according to her, not too high nor too heavy, and were provided, besides, with some kind of spring in the sole so as to make them the more supple for the foot in walking.  Personally, I object to all additional height being given to a boot or shoe; it is really against the proper principles of dress, although, if any such height is to be given it should be by means of two props; not one; but what I should prefer to see is some adaptation of the divided skirt or long and moderately loose knickerbockers.  If, however, the divided skirt is to be of any positive value, it must give up all idea of ""being identical in appearance with an ordinary skirt""; it must diminish the moderate width of each of its divisions, and sacrifice its foolish frills and flounces; the moment it imitates a dress it is lost; but let it visibly announce itself as what it actually is, and it will go far towards solving a real difficulty. I feel sure that there will be found many graceful and charming girls ready to adopt a costume founded on these principles, in spite of Mr. Wentworth Huyshe's terrible threat that he will not propose to them as long as they wear it, for all charges of a want of womanly character in these forms of dress are really meaningless; every right article of apparel belongs equally to both sexes, and there is absolutely no such thing as a definitely feminine garment.  One word of warning I should like to be allowed to give:  The over-tunic should be made full and moderately loose; it may, if desired, be shaped more or less to the figure, but in no case should it be confined at the waist by any straight band or belt; on the contrary, it should fall from the shoulder to the knee, or below it, in fine curves and vertical lines, giving more freedom and consequently more grace.  Few garments are so absolutely unbecoming as a belted tunic that reaches to the knees, a fact which I wish some of our Rosalinds would consider when they don doublet and hose; indeed, to the disregard of this artistic principle is due the ugliness, the want of proportion, in the Bloomer costume, a costume which in other respects is sensible.    COSTUME    Are we not all weary of him, that venerable impostor fresh from the steps of the Piazza di Spagna, who, in the leisure moments that he can spare from his customary organ, makes the round of the studios and is waited"|2
84|" for in Holland Park?  Do we not all recognize him, when, with the gay insouciance of his nation, he reappears on the walls of our summer exhibitions as everything that he is not, and as nothing that he is, glaring at us here as a patriarch of Canaan, here beaming as a brigand from the Abruzzi?  Popular is he, this poor peripatetic professor of posing, with those whose joy it is to paint the posthumous portrait of the last philanthropist who in his lifetime had neglected to be photographed,--yet he is the sign of the decadence, the symbol of decay.  For all costumes are caricatures.  The basis of Art is not the Fancy Ball.  Where there is loveliness of dress, there is no dressing up.  And so, were our national attire delightful in colour, and in construction simple and sincere; were dress the expression of the loveliness that it shields and of the swiftness and motion that it does not impede; did its lines break from the shoulder instead of bulging from the waist; did the inverted wineglass cease to be the ideal of form; were these things brought about, as brought about they will be, then would painting be no longer an artificial reaction against the ugliness of life, but become, as it should be, the natural expression of life's beauty. Nor would painting merely, but all the other arts also, be the gainers by a change such as that which I propose; the gainers, I mean, through the increased atmosphere of Beauty by which the artists would be surrounded and in which they would grow up.  For Art is not to be taught in Academies.  It is what one looks at, not what one listens to, that makes the artist.  The real schools should be the streets.  There is not, for instance, a single delicate line, or delightful proportion, in the dress of the Greeks, which is not echoed exquisitely in their architecture.  A nation arrayed in stove-pipe hats and dress-improvers might have built the Pantechnichon possibly, but the Parthenon never.  And finally, there is this to be said:  Art, it is true, can never have any other claim but her own perfection, and it may be that the artist, desiring merely to contemplate and to create, is wise in not busying himself about change in others:  yet wisdom is not always the best; there are times when she sinks to the level of common-sense; and from the passionate folly of those--and there are many--who desire that Beauty shall be confined no longer to the bric-a-brac of the collector and the dust of the museum, but shall be, as it should be, the natural and national inheritance of all,-- from this noble unwisdom, I say, who knows what new loveliness shall be given to life, and, under these more exquisite conditions, what perfect artist born?  Le milieu se renouvelant, l'art se renouvelle.    THE AMERICAN INVASION    A terrible danger is hanging over the Americans in London.  Their future and their reputation this season depend entirely on the success of Buffalo Bill and Mrs. Brown-Potter.  The former is certain to draw; for English people are far more interested in American barbarism than they are in American civilization.  When they sight Sandy Hook they look to their rifles and ammunition; and, after dining once at Delmonico's, start off for Colorado or California, for Montana or the Yellow Stone Park.  Rocky Mountains charm them more than riotous millionaires; they have been known to prefer buffaloes to Boston.  Why should they not?  The cities of America are inexpressibly tedious.  The Bostonians take their learning too sadly; culture with them is an accomplishment rather than an atmosphere; their ""Hub,"" as they call it, is the paradise of prigs.  Chicago is a sort of monster-shop, full of bustle and bores.  Political life at Washington is like political life in a suburban vestry.  Baltimore is amusing for a week, but Philadelphia is dreadfully provincial; and though one can dine in New York one could not dwell there.  Better the Far West with its grizzly bears and its untamed cowboys, its free open-air life and its free open- air manners, its boundless prairie and its boundless mendacity! This is what Buffalo Bill is going to bring to London; and we have no doubt that London will fully appreciate his show.  With regard to Mrs. Brown-Potter, as acting is no longer considered absolutely essential for success on the English stage, there is really no reason why the pretty bright-eyed lady who charmed us all last June by her merry laugh and her nonchalant ways, should not-- to borrow an expression from her native language--make a big boom and paint the town red.  We sincerely hope she will; for, on the whole, the American invasion has done English society a great deal of good.  American women are bright, clever, and wonderfully cosmopolitan.  Their patriotic feelings are limited to an admiration for Niagara and a regret for the Elevated Railway; and, unlike the men, they never bore us with Bunkers Hill.  They take their dresses from Paris and their manners from Piccadilly, and wear both charmingly.  They have a quaint pertness, a delightful conceit, a native self-assertion.  They insist on being paid compliments and have almost succeeded in making Englishmen eloquent.  For our aristocracy they have an ardent admiration; they adore titles and are a permanent blow to Republican principles.  In the art of amusing men they are adepts, both by nature and education, and can actually tell a story without forgetting the point--an accomplishment that is extremely rare among the women of other countries.  It is true that they lack repose and that their voices are somewhat harsh and strident when they land first at Liverpool; but after a time one gets to love those pretty whirlwinds in petticoats that sweep so recklessly through society and are so agitating to all duchesses who have daughters.  There is something fascinating in their funny, exaggerated gestures and their petulant way of tossing the head.  Their eyes have no magic nor mystery in them, but they challenge us for combat; and when we engage we are always worsted.  Their lips seem made for laughter and yet they never grimace.  As for their voices they soon get them into tune.  Some of them have been known to acquire a fashionable drawl in two seasons; and after they have been presented to Royalty they all roll their R's as vigorously as a young equerry or an old lady-in-waiting.  Still, they never really lose their accent; it keeps peeping out here and there, and when they chatter together they are like a bevy of peacocks.  Nothing is more amusing than to watch two American girls greeting each other in a drawing-room or in the Row.  They are like children with their shrill staccato cries of wonder, their odd little exclamations.  Their conversation sounds like a series of exploding crackers; they are exquisitely incoherent and use a sort of primitive, emotional language.  After five minutes they are left beautifully breathless and look at each other half in amusement and half in affection.  If a stolid young Englishman is fortunate enough to be introduced to them he is amazed at their extraordinary vivacity, their electric quickness of repartee, their inexhaustible store of curious catchwords.  He never really understands them, for their thoughts flutter about with the sweet irresponsibility of butterflies; but he is pleased and amused and feels as if he were in an aviary.  On the whole, American girls have a wonderful charm and, perhaps, the chief secret of their charm is that they never talk seriously except about amusements.  They have, however, one grave fault--their mothers.  Dreary as were those old Pilgrim Fathers who left our shores more than two centuries ago to found a New England beyond the seas, the Pilgrim Mothers who have returned to us in the nineteenth century are drearier still.  Here and there, of course, there are exceptions, but as a class they are either dull, dowdy or dyspeptic.  It is only fair to the rising generation of America to state that they are not to blame for this.  Indeed, they spare no pains at all to bring up their parents properly and to give them a suitable, if somewhat late, education.  From its earliest years every American child spends most of its time in correcting the faults of its father and mother; and no one who has had the opportunity of watching an American family on the deck of an Atlantic steamer, or in the refined seclusion of a New York boarding-house, can fail to have been struck by this characteristic of their civilization.  In America the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience.  A boy of only eleven or twelve years of age will firmly but kindly point out to his father his defects of manner or temper; will never weary of warning him against extravagance, idleness, late hours, unpunctuality, and the other temptations to which the aged are so particularly exposed; and sometimes, should he fancy that he is monopolizing too much of the conversation at dinner, will remind him, across the table, of the new child's adage, ""Parents should be seen, not heard.""  Nor does any mistaken idea of kindness prevent the little American girl from censuring her mother whenever it is necessary.  Often, indeed, feeling that a rebuke conveyed in the presence of others is more truly efficacious than one merely whispered in the quiet of the nursery, she will call the attention of perfect strangers to her mother's general untidiness, her want of intellectual Boston conversation, immoderate love of iced water and green corn, stinginess in the matter of candy, ignorance of the usages of the best Baltimore Society, bodily ailments, and the like.  In fact, it may be truly said that no American child is ever blind to the deficiencies of its parents, no matter how much it may love them.  Yet, somehow, this educational system has not been so successful as it deserved.  In many cases, no doubt, the material with which the children had to deal was crude and incapable of real development; but the fact remains that the American mother is a tedious person. The American father is better, for he is never seen in London.  He passes his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.  The mother, however, is always with us, and, lacking the quick imitative faculty of the younger generation, remains uninteresting and provincial to the last.  In spite of her, however, the American girl is always welcome.  She brightens our dull dinner parties for us and makes life go pleasantly by for a season.  In the race for coronets she often carries off the prize; but, once she has gained the victory, she is generous and forgives her English rivals everything, even their beauty.  Warned by the example of her mother that American women do not grow old gracefully, she tries not to grow old at all and often succeeds.  She has exquisite feet and hands, is always bien chaussee et bien gantee and can talk brilliantly upon any subject, provided that she knows nothing about it.  Her sense of humour keeps her from the tragedy of a grande passion, and, as there is neither romance nor humility in her love, she makes an excellent wife.  What her ultimate influence on English life will be it is difficult to estimate at present; but there can be no doubt that, of all the factors that have contributed to the social revolution of London, there are few more important, and none more delightful, than the American Invasion.    SERMONS IN STONES AT BLOOMSBURY THE NEW SCULPTURE ROOM AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM    Through the exertions of Sir Charles Newton, to whom every student of classic art should be grateful, some of the wonderful treasures so long immured in the grimy vaults of the British Museum have at last been brought to light, and the new Sculpture Room now opened to the public will amply repay the trouble of a visit, even from those to whom art is a stumbling-block and a rock of offence.  For setting aside the mere beauty of form, outline and mass, the grace and loveliness of design and the delicacy of technical treatment, here we have shown to us what the Greeks and Romans thought about death; and the philosopher, the preacher, the practical man of the world, and even the Philistine himself, cannot fail to be touched by these ""sermons in stones,"" with their deep significance, their fertile suggestion, their plain humanity.  Common tombstones they are, most of them, the work not of famous artists but of simple handicraftsmen, only they were wrought in days when every handicraft was an art.  The finest specimens, from the purely artistic point of view, are undoubtedly the two stelai found at Athens.  They are both the tombstones of young Greek athletes.  In one the athlete is represented handing his strigil to his slave, in the other the athlete stands alone, strigil in hand.  They do not belong to the greatest period of Greek art, they have not the grand style of the Phidian age, but they are beautiful for all that, and it is impossible not to be fascinated by their exquisite grace and by the treatment which is so simple in its means, so subtle in its effect.  All the tombstones, however, are full of interest.  Here is one of two ladies of Smyrna who were so remarkable in their day that the city voted them honorary crowns; here is a Greek doctor examining a little boy who is suffering from indigestion; here is the memorial of Xanthippus who, probably, was a martyr to gout, as he is holding in his hand the model of a foot, intended, no doubt, as a votive offering to some god.  A lovely stele from Rhodes gives us a family group.  The husband is on horseback and is bidding farewell to his wife, who seems as if she would follow him but is being held back by a little child.  The pathos of parting from those we love is the central motive of Greek funeral art.  It is repeated in every possible form, and each mute marble stone seems to murmur [Greek text].  Roman art is different.  It introduces vigorous and realistic portraiture and deals with pure family life far more frequently than Greek art does.  They are very ugly, those stern-looking Roman men and women whose portraits are exhibited on their tombs, but they seem to have been loved and respected by their children and their servants.  Here is the monument of Aphrodisius and Atilia, a Roman gentleman and his wife, who died in Britain many centuries ago, and whose tombstone was found in the Thames; and close by it stands a stele from Rome with the busts of an old married couple who are certainly marvellously ill-favoured. The contrast between the abstract Greek treatment of the idea of death and the Roman concrete realization of the individuals who have died is extremely curious.  Besides the tombstones, the new Sculpture Room contains some most fascinating examples of Roman decorative art under the Emperors. The most wonderful of all, and this alone is worth a trip to Bloomsbury, is a bas-relief representing a marriage scene, Juno Pronuba is joining the hands of a handsome young noble and a very stately lady.  There is all the grace of Perugino in this marble, all the grace of Raphael even.  The date of it is uncertain, but the particular cut of the bridegroom's beard seems to point to the time of the Emperor Hadrian.  It is clearly the work of Greek artists and is one of the most beautiful bas-reliefs in the whole Museum.  There is something in it which reminds one of the music and the sweetness of Propertian verse.  Then we have delightful friezes of children.  One representing children playing on musical instruments might have suggested much of the plastic art of Florence.  Indeed, as we view these marbles it is not difficult to see whence the Renaissance sprang and to what we owe the various forms of Renaissance art.  The frieze of the Muses, each of whom wears in her hair a feather plucked from the wings of the vanquished sirens, is extremely fine; there is a lovely little bas- relief of two cupids racing in chariots; and the frieze of recumbent Amazons has some splendid qualities of design.  A frieze of children playing with the armour of the god Mars should also be mentioned.  It is full of fancy and delicate humour.   We hope that some more of the hidden treasures will shortly be catalogued and shown.  In the vaults at present there is a very remarkable bas-relief of the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, and another representing the professional mourners weeping over the body of the dead.  The fine cast of the Lion of Chaeronea should also be brought up, and so should the stele with the marvellous portrait of the Roman slave.  Economy is an excellent public virtue, but the parsimony that allows valuable works of art to remain in the grim and gloom of a damp cellar is little short of a detestable public vice.    L'ENVOI    Amongst the many young men in England who are seeking along with me to continue and to perfect the English Renaissance--jeunes guerriers du drapeau romantique, as Gautier would have called us-- there is none whose love of art is more flawless and fervent, whose artistic sense of beauty is more subtle and more delicate--none, indeed, who is dearer to myself--than the young poet whose verses I have brought with me to America; verses full of sweet sadness, and yet full of joy; for the most joyous poet is not he who sows the desolate highways of this world with the barren seed of laughter, but he who makes his sorrow most musical, this indeed being the meaning of joy in art--that incommunicable element of artistic delight which, in poetry, for instance, comes from what Keats called ""sensuous life of verse,"" the element of song in the singing, made so pleasurable to us by that wonder of motion which often has its origin in mere musical impulse, and in painting is to be sought for, from the subject never, but from the pictorial charm only--the scheme and symphony of the colour, the satisfying beauty of the design:  so that the ultimate expression of our artistic movement in painting has been, not in the spiritual vision of the Pre-Raphaelites, for all their marvel of Greek legend and their mystery of Italian song, but in the work of such men as Whistler and Albert Moore, who have raised design and colour to the ideal level of poetry and music.  For the quality of their exquisite painting comes from the mere inventive and creative handling of line and colour, from a certain form and choice of beautiful workmanship, which, rejecting all literary reminiscence and all metaphysical idea, is in itself entirely satisfying to the aesthetic sense--is, as the Greeks would say, an end in itself; the effect of their work being like the effect given to us by music; for music is the art in which form and matter are always one--the art whose subject cannot be separated from the method of its expression; the art which most completely realizes for us the artistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts are constantly aspiring.  Now, this increased sense of the absolutely satisfying value of beautiful workmanship, this recognition of the primary importance of the sensuous element in art, this love of art for art's sake, is the point in which we of the younger school have made a departure from the teaching of Mr. Ruskin,--a departure definite and different and decisive.  Master indeed of the knowledge of all noble living and of the wisdom of all spiritual things will he be to us ever, seeing that it was he who by the magic of his presence and the music of his lips taught us at Oxford that enthusiasm for beauty which is the secret of Hellenism, and that desire for creation which is the secret of life, and filled some of us, at least, with the lofty and passionate ambition to go forth into far and fair lands with some message for the nations and some mission for the world, and yet in his art criticism, his estimate of the joyous element of art, his whole method of approaching art, we are no longer with him; for the keystone to his aesthetic system is ethical always.  He would judge of a picture by the amount of noble moral ideas it expresses; but to us the channels by which all noble work in painting can touch, and does touch, the soul are not those of truths of life or metaphysical truths.  To him perfection of workmanship seems but the symbol of pride, and incompleteness of technical resource the image of an imagination too limitless to find within the limits of form its complete expression, or of love too simple not to stammer in its tale.  But to us the rule of art is not the rule of morals. In an ethical system, indeed, of any gentle mercy good intentions will, one is fain to fancy, have their recognition; but of those that would enter the serene House of Beauty the question that we ask is not what they had ever meant to do, but what they have done. Their pathetic intentions are of no value to us, but their realized creations only.  Pour moi je prefere les poetes qui font des vers, les medecins qui sachent guerir, les peintres qui sanchent peindre.  Nor, in looking at a work of art, should we be dreaming of what it symbolises, but rather loving it for what it is.  Indeed, the transcendental spirit is alien to the spirit of art.  The metaphysical mind of Asia may create for itself the monstrous and many-breasted idol, but to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms most closely to the perfect facts of physical life also.  Nor, in its primary aspect, has a painting, for instance, any more spiritual message or meaning for us than a blue tile from the wall of Damascus, or a Hitzen vase.  It is a beautifully coloured surface, nothing more, and affects us by no suggestion stolen from philosophy, no pathos pilfered from literature, no feeling filched from a poet, but by its own incommunicable artistic essence--by that selection of truth which we call style, and that relation of values which is the draughtsmanship of painting, by the whole quality of the workmanship, the arabesque of the design, the splendour of the colour, for these things are enough to stir the most divine and remote of the chords which make music in our soul, and colour, indeed, is of itself a mystical presence on things, and tone a kind of sentiment . . . all these poems aim, as I said, at producing a purely artistic effect, and have the rare and exquisite quality that belongs to work of that kind; and I feel that the entire subordination in our aesthetic movement of all merely emotional and intellectual motives to the vital informing poetic principle is the surest sign of our strength.  But it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the aesthetic demands of the age:  there should be also about it, if it is to give us any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality.  Whatever work we have in the nineteenth century must rest on the two poles of personality and perfection.  And so in this little volume, by separating the earlier and more simple work from the work that is later and stronger and possesses increased technical power and more artistic vision, one might weave these disconnected poems, these stray and scattered threads, into one fiery-coloured strand of life, noting first a boy's mere gladness of being young, with all its simple joy in field and flower, in sunlight and in song, and then the bitterness of sudden sorrow at the ending by Death of one of the brief and beautiful friendships of one's youth, with all those unanswered lodgings and questionings unsatisfied by which we vex, so uselessly, the marble face of death; the artistic contrast between the discontented incompleteness of the spirit and the complete perfection of the style that expresses it forming the chief element of the aesthetic charm of these particular poems;--and then the birth of Love, and all the wonder and the fear and the perilous delight of one on whose boyish brows the little wings of love have beaten for the first time; and the love-songs, so dainty and delicate, little swallow-flights of music, and full of such fragrance and freedom that they might all be sung in the open air and across moving water; and then autumn, coming with its choirless woods and odorous decay and ruined loveliness, Love lying dead; and the sense of the mere pity of it.  One might stop there, for from a young poet one should ask for no deeper chords of life than those that love and friendship make eternal for us; and the best poems in the volume belong clearly to a later time, a time when these real experiences become absorbed and gathered up into a form which seems from such real experiences to be the most alien and the most remote; when the simple expression of joy or sorrow suffices no longer, and lives rather in the stateliness of the cadenced metre, in the music and colour of the linked words, than in any direct utterance; lives, one might say, in the perfection of the form more than in the pathos of the feeling.  And yet, after the broken music of love and the burial of love in the autumn woods, we can trace that wandering among strange people, and in lands unknown to us, by which we try so pathetically to heal the hurts of the life we know, and that pure and passionate devotion to Art which one gets when the harsh reality of life has too suddenly wounded one, and is with discontent or sorrow marring one's youth, just as often, I think, as one gets it from any natural joy of living; and that curious intensity of vision by which, in moments of overmastering sadness and despair ungovernable, artistic things will live in one's memory with a vivid realism caught from the life which they help one to forget-- an old grey tomb in Flanders with a strange legend on it, making one think how, perhaps, passion does live on after death; a necklace of blue and amber beads and a broken mirror found in a girl's grave at Rome, a marble image of a boy habited like Eros, and with the pathetic tradition of a great king's sorrow lingering about it like a purple shadow,--over all these the tired spirit broods with that calm and certain joy that one gets when one has found something that the ages never dull and the world cannot harm; and with it comes that desire of Greek things which is often an artistic method of expressing one's desire for perfection; and that longing for the old dead days which is so modern, so incomplete, so touching, being, in a way, the inverted torch of Hope, which burns the hand it should guide; and for many things a little sadness, and for all things a great love; and lastly, in the pinewood by the sea, once more the quick and vital pulse of joyous youth leaping and laughing in every line, the frank and fearless freedom of wave and wind waking into fire life's burnt-out ashes and into song the silent lips of pain,--how clearly one seems to see it all, the long colonnade of pines with sea and sky peeping in here and there like a flitting of silver; the open place in the green, deep heart of the wood with the little moss-grown altar to the old Italian god in it; and the flowers all about, cyclamen in the shadowy places, and the stars of the white narcissus lying like snow-flakes over the grass, where the quick, bright-eyed lizard starts by the stone, and the snake lies coiled lazily in the sun on the hot sand, and overhead the gossamer floats from the branches like thin, tremulous threads of gold,--the scene is so perfect for its motive, for surely here, if anywhere, the real gladness of life might be revealed to one's youth--the gladness that comes, not from the rejection, but from the absorption, of all passion, and is like that serene calm that dwells in the faces of the Greek statues, and which despair and sorrow cannot touch, but intensify only.  In some such way as this we could gather up these strewn and scattered petals of song into one perfect rose of life, and yet, perhaps, in so doing, we might be missing the true quality of the poems; one's real life is so often the life that one does not lead; and beautiful poems, like threads of beautiful silks, may be woven into many patterns and to suit many designs, all wonderful and all different:  and romantic poetry, too, is essentially the poetry of impressions, being like that latest school of painting, the school of Whistler and Albert Moore, in its choice of situation as opposed to subject; in its dealing with the exceptions rather than with the types of life; in its brief intensity; in what one might call its fi"|2
85|"ery-coloured momentariness, it being indeed the momentary situations of life, the momentary aspects of nature, which poetry and painting new seek to render for us.  Sincerity and constancy will the artist, indeed, have always; but sincerity in art is merely that plastic perfection of execution without which a poem or a painting, however noble its sentiment or human its origin, is but wasted and unreal work, and the constancy of the artist cannot be to any definite rule or system of living, but to that principle of beauty only through which the inconstant shadows of his life are in their most fleeting moment arrested and made permanent.  He will not, for instance, in intellectual matters acquiesce in that facile orthodoxy of our day which is so reasonable and so artistically uninteresting, nor yet will he desire that fiery faith of the antique time which, while it intensified, yet limited the vision; still less will he allow the calm of his culture to be marred by the discordant despair of doubt or the sadness of a sterile scepticism; for the Valley Perilous, where ignorant armies clash by night, is no resting-place meet for her to whom the gods have assigned the clear upland, the serene height, and the sunlit air,-- rather will he be always curiously testing new forms of belief, tinging his nature with the sentiment that still lingers about some beautiful creeds, and searching for experience itself, and not for the fruits of experience; when he has got its secret, he will leave without regret much that was once very precious to him.  ""I am always insincere,"" says Emerson somewhere, ""as knowing that there are other moods"":  ""Les emotions,"" wrote Theophile Gautier once in a review of Arsene Houssaye, ""Les emotions, ne se ressemblent pas, mais etre emu--voila l'important.""  Now, this is the secret of the art of the modern romantic school, and gives one the right keynote for its apprehension; but the real quality of all work which, like Mr. Rodd's, aims, as I said, at a purely artistic effect, cannot be described in terms of intellectual criticism; it is too intangible for that.  One can perhaps convey it best in terms of the other arts, and by reference to them; and, indeed, some of these poems are as iridescent and as exquisite as a lovely fragment of Venetian glass; others as delicate in perfect workmanship and as single in natural motive as an etching by Whistler is, or one of those beautiful little Greek figures which in the olive woods round Tanagra men can still find, with the faint gilding and the fading crimson not yet fled from hair and lips and raiment; and many of them seem like one of Corot's twilights just passing into music; for not merely in visible colour, but in sentiment also--which is the colour of poetry--may there be a kind of tone.  But I think that the best likeness to the quality of this young poet's work I ever saw was in the landscape by the Loire.  We were staying once, he and I, at Amboise, that little village with its grey slate roofs and steep streets and gaunt, grim gateway, where the quiet cottages nestle like white pigeons into the sombre clefts of the great bastioned rock, and the stately Renaissance houses stand silent and apart--very desolate now, but with some memory of the old days still lingering about the delicately-twisted pillars, and the carved doorways, with their grotesque animals, and laughing masks, and quaint heraldic devices, all reminding one of a people who could not think life real till they had made it fantastic.  And above the village, and beyond the bend of the river, we used to go in the afternoon, and sketch from one of the big barges that bring the wine in autumn and the wood in winter down to the sea, or lie in the long grass and make plans pour la gloire, et pour ennuyer les Philistins, or wander along the low, sedgy banks, ""matching our reeds in sportive rivalry,"" as comrades used in the old Sicilian days; and the land was an ordinary land enough, and bare, too, when one thought of Italy, and how the oleanders were robing the hillsides by Genoa in scarlet, and the cyclamen filling with its purple every valley from Florence to Rome; for there was not much real beauty, perhaps, in it, only long, white dusty roads and straight rows of formal poplars; but, now and then, some little breaking gleam of broken light would lend to the grey field and the silent barn a secret and a mystery that were hardly their own, would transfigure for one exquisite moment the peasants passing down through the vineyard, or the shepherd watching on the hill, would tip the willows with silver and touch the river into gold; and the wonder of the effect, with the strange simplicity of the material, always seemed to me to be a little like the quality of these the verses of my friend.  THE SOUL OF MAN   THE chief advantage that would result from the establishment of Socialism is, undoubtedly, the fact that Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.  In fact, scarcely anyone at all escapes.  Now and then, in the course of the century, a great man of science, like Darwin; a great poet, like Keats; a fine critical spirit, like M. Renan; a supreme artist, like Flaubert, has been able to isolate himself, to keep himself out of reach of the clamorous claims of others, to stand ?under the shelter of the wall,? as Plato puts it, and so to realise the perfection of what was in him, to his own incomparable gain, and to the incomparable and lasting gain of the whole world.  These, however, are exceptions.  The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism?are forced, indeed, so to spoil them.  They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation.  It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this.  The emotions of man are stirred more quickly than man's intelligence; and, as I pointed out some time ago in an article on the function of criticism, it is much more easy to have sympathy with suffering than it is to have sympathy with thought.  Accordingly, with admirable, though misdirected intentions, they very seriously and very sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see.  But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed, their remedies are part of the disease.  They try to solve the problem of poverty, for instance, by keeping the poor alive; or, in the case of a very advanced school, by amusing the poor.  But this is not a solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty.  The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible.  And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim.  Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life?educated men who live in the East End?coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like.  They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises.  They are perfectly right.  Charity creates a multitude of sins.  There is also this to be said.  It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.  It is both immoral and unfair.  Under Socialism all this will, of course, be altered.  There will be no people living in fetid dens and fetid rags, and bringing up unhealthy, hunger-pinched children in the midst of impossible and absolutely repulsive surroundings.  The security of society will not depend, as it does now, on the state of the weather.  If a frost comes we shall not have a hundred thousand men out of work, tramping about the streets in a state of disgusting misery, or whining to their neighbours for alms, or crowding round the doors of loathsome shelters to try and secure a hunch of bread and a night's unclean lodging.  Each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society, and if a frost comes no one will practically be anything the worse.  Upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to Individualism.  Socialism, Communism, or whatever one chooses to call it, by converting private property into public wealth, and substituting co-operation for competition, will restore society to its proper condition of a thoroughly healthy organism, and insure the material well-being of each member of the community.  It will, in fact, give Life its proper basis and its proper environment.  But for the full development of Life to its highest mode of perfection, something more is needed.  What is needed is Individualism.  If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.  At present, in consequence of the existence of private property, a great many people are enabled to develop a certain very limited amount of Individualism.  They are either under no necessity to work for their living, or are enabled to choose the sphere of activity that is really congenial to them, and gives them pleasure.  These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture?in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation.  Upon the other hand, there are a great many people who, having no private property of their own, and being always on the brink of sheer starvation, are compelled to do the work of beasts of burden, to do work that is quite uncongenial to them, and to which they are forced by the peremptory, unreasonable, degrading Tyranny of want.  These are the poor, and amongst them there is no grace of manner, or charm of speech, or civilisation, or culture, or refinement in pleasures, or joy of life. From their collective force Humanity gains much in material prosperity. But it is only the material result that it gains, and the man who is poor is in himself absolutely of no importance.  He is merely the infinitesimal atom of a force that, so far from regarding him, crushes him: indeed, prefers him crushed, as in that case he is far more obedient.  Of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type, and that the poor, if they have not culture and charm, have still many virtues.  Both these statements would be quite true.  The possession of private property is very often extremely demoralising, and that is, of course, one of the reasons why Socialism wants to get rid of the institution.  In fact, property is really a nuisance.  Some years ago people went about the country saying that property has duties.  They said it so often and so tediously that, at last, the Church has begun to say it.  One hears it now from every pulpit.  It is perfectly true.  Property not merely has duties, but has so many duties that its possession to any large extent is a bore.  It involves endless claims upon one, endless attention to business, endless bother.  If property had simply pleasures, we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable.  In the interest of the rich we must get rid of it.  The virtues of the poor may be readily admitted, and are much to be regretted.  We are often told that the poor are grateful for charity. Some of them are, no doubt, but the best amongst the poor are never grateful.  They are ungrateful, discontented, disobedient, and rebellious.  They are quite right to be so.  Charity they feel to be a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution, or a sentimental dole, usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over their private lives.  Why should they be grateful for the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table?  They should be seated at the board, and are beginning to know it.  As for being discontented, a man who would not be discontented with such surroundings and such a low mode of life would be a perfect brute.  Disobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is man's original virtue.  It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.  Sometimes the poor are praised for being thrifty. But to recommend thrift to the poor is both grotesque and insulting.  It is like advising a man who is starving to eat less.  For a town or country labourer to practise thrift would be absolutely immoral.  Man should not be ready to show that he can live like a badly-fed animal.  He should decline to live like that, and should either steal or go on the rates, which is considered by many to be a form of stealing.  As for begging, it is safer to beg than to take, but it is finer to take than to beg.  No: a poor man who is ungrateful, unthrifty, discontented, and rebellious, is probably a real personality, and has much in him.  He is at any rate a healthy protest.  As for the virtuous poor, one can pity them, of course, but one cannot possibly admire them.  They have made private terms with the enemy, and sold their birthright for very bad pottage.  They must also be extraordinarily stupid.  I can quite understand a man accepting laws that protect private property, and admit of its accumulation, as long as he himself is able under those conditions to realise some form of beautiful and intellectual life.  But it is almost incredible to me how a man whose life is marred and made hideous by such laws can possibly acquiesce in their continuance.  However, the explanation is not really difficult to find.  It is simply this.  Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such a paralysing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering.  They have to be told of it by other people, and they often entirely disbelieve them.  What is said by great employers of labour against agitators is unquestionably true.  Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community, and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them.  That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary.  Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilisation.  Slavery was put down in America, not in consequence of any action on the part of the slaves, or even any express desire on their part that they should be free.  It was put down entirely through the grossly illegal conduct of certain agitators in Boston and elsewhere, who were not slaves themselves, nor owners of slaves, nor had anything to do with the question really.  It was, undoubtedly, the Abolitionists who set the torch alight, who began the whole thing.  And it is curious to note that from the slaves themselves they received, not merely very little assistance, but hardly any sympathy even; and when at the close of the war the slaves found themselves free, found themselves indeed so absolutely free that they were free to starve, many of them bitterly regretted the new state of things.  To the thinker, the most tragic fact in the whole of the French Revolution is not that Marie Antoinette was killed for being a queen, but that the starved peasant of the Vend?e voluntarily went out to die for the hideous cause of feudalism.  It is clear, then, that no Authoritarian Socialism will do.  For while under the present system a very large number of people can lead lives of a certain amount of freedom and expression and happiness, under an industrial-barrack system, or a system of economic tyranny, nobody would be able to have any such freedom at all.  It is to be regretted that a portion of our community should be practically in slavery, but to propose to solve the problem by enslaving the entire community is childish. Every man must be left quite free to choose his own work.  No form of compulsion must be exercised over him.  If there is, his work will not be good for him, will not be good in itself, and will not be good for others.  And by work I simply mean activity of any kind.  I hardly think that any Socialist, nowadays, would seriously propose that an inspector should call every morning at each house to see that each citizen rose up and did manual labour for eight hours.  Humanity has got beyond that stage, and reserves such a form of life for the people whom, in a very arbitrary manner, it chooses to call criminals.  But I confess that many of the socialistic views that I have come across seem to me to be tainted with ideas of authority, if not of actual compulsion.  Of course, authority and compulsion are out of the question.  All association must be quite voluntary.  It is only in voluntary associations that man is fine.  But it may be asked how Individualism, which is now more or less dependent on the existence of private property for its development, will benefit by the abolition of such private property.  The answer is very simple.  It is true that, under existing conditions, a few men who have had private means of their own, such as Byron, Shelley, Browning, Victor Hugo, Baudelaire, and others, have been able to realise their personality more or less completely.  Not one of these men ever did a single day's work for hire.  They were relieved from poverty.  They had an immense advantage.  The question is whether it would be for the good of Individualism that such an advantage should be taken away.  Let us suppose that it is taken away.  What happens then to Individualism?  How will it benefit?  It will benefit in this way.  Under the new conditions Individualism will be far freer, far finer, and far more intensified than it is now.  I am not talking of the great imaginatively-realised Individualism of such poets as I have mentioned, but of the great actual Individualism latent and potential in mankind generally.  For the recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses.  It has led Individualism entirely astray. It has made gain not growth its aim.  So that man thought that the important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be.  The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is.  Private property has crushed true Individualism, and set up an Individualism that is false.  It has debarred one part of the community from being individual by starving them.  It has debarred the other part of the community from being individual by putting them on the wrong road, and encumbering them.  Indeed, so completely has man's personality been absorbed by his possessions that the English law has always treated offences against a man's property with far more severity than offences against his person, and property is still the test of complete citizenship.  The industry necessary for the making money is also very demoralising.  In a community like ours, where property confers immense distinction, social position, honour, respect, titles, and other pleasant things of the kind, man, being naturally ambitious, makes it his aim to accumulate this property, and goes on wearily and tediously accumulating it long after he has got far more than he wants, or can use, or enjoy, or perhaps even know of.  Man will kill himself by overwork in order to secure property, and really, considering the enormous advantages that property brings, one is hardly surprised.  One's regret is that society should be constructed on such a basis that man has been forced into a groove in which he cannot freely develop what is wonderful, and fascinating, and delightful in him?in which, in fact, he misses the true pleasure and joy of living.  He is also, under existing conditions, very insecure.  An enormously wealthy merchant may be?often is?at every moment of his life at the mercy of things that are not under his control.  If the wind blows an extra point or so, or the weather suddenly changes, or some trivial thing happens, his ship may go down, his speculations may go wrong, and he finds himself a poor man, with his social position quite gone.  Now, nothing should be able to harm a man except himself.  Nothing should be able to rob a man at all.  What a man really has, is what is in him.  What is outside of him should be a matter of no importance.  With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism.  Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things.  One will live.  To live is the rarest thing in the world.  Most people exist, that is all.  It is a question whether we have ever seen the full expression of a personality, except on the imaginative plane of art.  In action, we never have.  C'sar, says Mommsen, was the complete and perfect man.  But how tragically insecure was C'sar!  Wherever there is a man who exercises authority, there is a man who resists authority.  C'sar was very perfect, but his perfection travelled by too dangerous a road.  Marcus Aurelius was the perfect man, says Renan.  Yes; the great emperor was a perfect man.  But how intolerable were the endless claims upon him!  He staggered under the burden of the empire.  He was conscious how inadequate one man was to bear the weight of that Titan and too vast orb.  What I mean by a perfect man is one who develops under perfect conditions; one who is not wounded, or worried or maimed, or in danger.  Most personalities have been obliged to be rebels.  Half their strength has been wasted in friction.  Byron's personality, for instance, was terribly wasted in its battle with the stupidity, and hypocrisy, and Philistinism of the English.  Such battles do not always intensify strength: they often exaggerate weakness.  Byron was never able to give us what he might have given us.  Shelley escaped better.  Like Byron, he got out of England as soon as possible.  But he was not so well known.  If the English had had any idea of what a great poet he really was, they would have fallen on him with tooth and nail, and made his life as unbearable to him as they possibly could.  But he was not a remarkable figure in society, and consequently he escaped, to a certain degree.  Still, even in Shelley the note of rebellion is sometimes too strong.  The note of the perfect personality is not rebellion, but peace.  It will be a marvellous thing?the true personality of man?when we see it. It will grow naturally and simply, flowerlike, or as a tree grows.  It will not be at discord.  It will never argue or dispute.  It will not prove things.  It will know everything.  And yet it will not busy itself about knowledge.  It will have wisdom.  Its value will not be measured by material things.  It will have nothing.  And yet it will have everything, and whatever one takes from it, it will still have, so rich will it be. It will not be always meddling with others, or asking them to be like itself.  It will love them because they will be different.  And yet while it will not meddle with others, it will help all, as a beautiful thing helps us, by being what it is.  The personality of man will be very wonderful.  It will be as wonderful as the personality of a child.  In its development it will be assisted by Christianity, if men desire that; but if men do not desire that, it will develop none the less surely.  For it will not worry itself about the past, nor care whether things happened or did not happen.  Nor will it admit any laws but its own laws; nor any authority but its own authority.  Yet it will love those who sought to intensify it, and speak often of them.  And of these Christ was one.  ?Know thyself? was written over the portal of the antique world.  Over the portal of the new world, ?Be thyself? shall be written.  And the message of Christ to man was simply ?Be thyself.?  That is the secret of Christ.  When Jesus talks about the poor he simply means personalities, just as when he talks about the rich he simply means people who have not developed their personalities.  Jesus moved in a community that allowed the accumulation of private property just as ours does, and the gospel that he preached was not that in such a community it is an advantage for a man to live on scanty, unwholesome food, to wear ragged, unwholesome clothes, to sleep in horrid, unwholesome dwellings, and a disadvantage for a man to live under healthy, pleasant, and decent conditions.  Such a view would have been wrong there and then, and would, of course, be still more wrong now and in England; for as man moves northward the material necessities of life become of more vital importance, and our society is infinitely more complex, and displays far greater extremes of luxury and pauperism than any society of the antique world.  What Jesus meant, was this.  He said to man, ?You have a wonderful personality.  Develop it. Be yourself.  Don?t imagine that your perfection lies in accumulating or possessing external things.  Your affection is inside of you.  If only you could realise that, you would not want to be rich.  Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man.  Real riches cannot.  In the treasury-house of your soul, there are infinitely precious things, that may not be taken from you.  And so, try to so shape your life that external things will not harm you.  And try also to get rid of personal property.  It involves sordid preoccupation, endless industry, continual wrong.  Personal property hinders Individualism at every step.?  It is to be noted that Jesus never says that impoverished people are necessarily good, or wealthy people necessarily bad.  That would not have been true.  Wealthy people are, as a class, better than impoverished people, more moral, more intellectual, more well-behaved.  There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor.  The poor can think of nothing else.  That is the misery of being poor.  What Jesus does say is that man reaches his perfection, not through what he has, not even through what he does, but entirely through what he is.  And so the wealthy young man who comes to Jesus is represented as a thoroughly good citizen, who has broken none of the laws of his state, none of the commandments of his religion.  He is quite respectable, in the ordinary sense of that extraordinary word.  Jesus says to him, ?You should give up private property.  It hinders you from realising your perfection.  It is a drag upon you.  It is a burden.  Your personality does not need it.  It is within you, and not outside of you, that you will find what you really are, and what you really want.?  To his own friends he says the same thing.  He tells them to be themselves, and not to be always worrying about other things.  What do other things matter?  Man is complete in himself.  When they go into the world, the world will disagree with them.  That is inevitable.  The world hates Individualism.  But that is not to trouble them.  They are to be calm and self-centred.  If a man takes their cloak, they are to give him their coat, just to show that material things are of no importance.  If people abuse them, they are not to answer back.  What does it signify?  The things people say of a man do not alter a man.  He is what he is.  Public opinion is of no value whatsoever.  Even if people employ actual violence, they are not to be violent in turn.  That would be to fall to the same low level.  After all, even in prison, a man can be quite free. His soul can be free.  His personality can be untroubled.  He can be at peace.  And, above all things, they are not to interfere with other people or judge them in any way.  Personality is a very mysterious thing. A man cannot always be estimated by what he does.  He may keep the law, and yet be worthless.  He may break the law, and yet be fine.  He may be bad, without ever doing anything bad.  He may commit a sin against society, and yet realise through that sin his true"|2
86| perfection.  There was a woman who was taken in adultery.  We are not told the history of her love, but that love must have been very great; for Jesus said that her sins were forgiven her, not because she repented, but because her love was so intense and wonderful.  Later on, a short time before his death, as he sat at a feast, the woman came in and poured costly perfumes on his hair.  His friends tried to interfere with her, and said that it was an extravagance, and that the money that the perfume cost should have been expended on charitable relief of people in want, or something of that kind.  Jesus did not accept that view.  He pointed out that the material needs of Man were great and very permanent, but that the spiritual needs of Man were greater still, and that in one divine moment, and by selecting its own mode of expression, a personality might make itself perfect.  The world worships the woman, even now, as a saint.  Yes; there are suggestive things in Individualism.  Socialism annihilates family life, for instance.  With the abolition of private property, marriage in its present form must disappear.  This is part of the programme.  Individualism accepts this and makes it fine.  It converts the abolition of legal restraint into a form of freedom that will help the full development of personality, and make the love of man and woman more wonderful, more beautiful, and more ennobling.  Jesus knew this.  He rejected the claims of family life, although they existed in his day and community in a very marked form.  ?Who is my mother?  Who are my brothers?? he said, when he was told that they wished to speak to him. When one of his followers asked leave to go and bury his father, ?Let the dead bury the dead,? was his terrible answer.  He would allow no claim whatsoever to be made on personality.  And so he who would lead a Christlike life is he who is perfectly and absolutely himself.  He may be a great poet, or a great man of science; or a young student at a University, or one who watches sheep upon a moor; or a maker of dramas, like Shakespeare, or a thinker about God, like Spinoza; or a child who plays in a garden, or a fisherman who throws his net into the sea.  It does not matter what he is, as long as he realises the perfection of the soul that is within him.  All imitation in morals and in life is wrong.  Through the streets of Jerusalem at the present day crawls one who is mad and carries a wooden cross on his shoulders. He is a symbol of the lives that are marred by imitation.  Father Damien was Christlike when he went out to live with the lepers, because in such service he realised fully what was best in him.  But he was not more Christlike than Wagner when he realised his soul in music; or than Shelley, when he realised his soul in song.  There is no one type for man.  There are as many perfections as there are imperfect men.  And while to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free, to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all.  Individualism, then, is what through Socialism we are to attain to.  As a natural result the State must give up all idea of government.  It must give it up because, as a wise man once said many centuries before Christ, there is such a thing as leaving mankind alone; there is no such thing as governing mankind.  All modes of government are failures.  Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was probably made for better things.  Oligarchies are unjust to the many, and ochlocracies are unjust to the few.  High hopes were once formed of democracy; but democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.  It has been found out.  I must say that it was high time, for all authority is quite degrading.  It degrades those who exercise it, and degrades those over whom it is exercised.  When it is violently, grossly, and cruelly used, it produces a good effect, by creating, or at any rate bringing out, the spirit of revolt and Individualism that is to kill it.  When it is used with a certain amount of kindness, and accompanied by prizes and rewards, it is dreadfully demoralising. People, in that case, are less conscious of the horrible pressure that is being put on them, and so go through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort, like petted animals, without ever realising that they are probably thinking other people's thoughts, living by other people's standards, wearing practically what one may call other people's second-hand clothes, and never being themselves for a single moment.  ?He who would be free,? says a fine thinker, ?must not conform.?  And authority, by bribing people to conform, produces a very gross kind of over-fed barbarism amongst us.  With authority, punishment will pass away.  This will be a great gain?a gain, in fact, of incalculable value.  As one reads history, not in the expurgated editions written for school-boys and passmen, but in the original authorities of each time, one is absolutely sickened, not by the crimes that the wicked have committed, but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalised by the habitual employment of punishment, than it is by the occurrence of crime. It obviously follows that the more punishment is inflicted the more crime is produced, and most modern legislation has clearly recognised this, and has made it its task to diminish punishment as far as it thinks it can. Wherever it has really diminished it, the results have always been extremely good.  The less punishment, the less crime.  When there is no punishment at all, crime will either cease to exist, or, if it occurs, will be treated by physicians as a very distressing form of dementia, to be cured by care and kindness.  For what are called criminals nowadays are not criminals at all.  Starvation, and not sin, is the parent of modern crime.  That indeed is the reason why our criminals are, as a class, so absolutely uninteresting from any psychological point of view. They are not marvellous Macbeths and terrible Vautrins.  They are merely what ordinary, respectable, commonplace people would be if they had not got enough to eat.  When private property is abolished there will be no necessity for crime, no demand for it; it will cease to exist.  Of course, all crimes are not crimes against property, though such are the crimes that the English law, valuing what a man has more than what a man is, punishes with the harshest and most horrible severity, if we except the crime of murder, and regard death as worse than penal servitude, a point on which our criminals, I believe, disagree.  But though a crime may not be against property, it may spring from the misery and rage and depression produced by our wrong system of property-holding, and so, when that system is abolished, will disappear.  When each member of the community has sufficient for his wants, and is not interfered with by his neighbour, it will not be an object of any interest to him to interfere with anyone else.  Jealousy, which is an extraordinary source of crime in modern life, is an emotion closely bound up with our conceptions of property, and under Socialism and Individualism will die out.  It is remarkable that in communistic tribes jealousy is entirely unknown.  Now as the State is not to govern, it may be asked what the State is to do.  The State is to be a voluntary association that will organise labour, and be the manufacturer and distributor of necessary commodities. The State is to make what is useful.  The individual is to make what is beautiful.  And as I have mentioned the word labour, I cannot help saying that a great deal of nonsense is being written and talked nowadays about the dignity of manual labour.  There is nothing necessarily dignified about manual labour at all, and most of it is absolutely degrading.  It is mentally and morally injurious to man to do anything in which he does not find pleasure, and many forms of labour are quite pleasureless activities, and should be regarded as such.  To sweep a slushy crossing for eight hours, on a day when the east wind is blowing is a disgusting occupation.  To sweep it with mental, moral, or physical dignity seems to me to be impossible.  To sweep it with joy would be appalling.  Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt.  All work of that kind should be done by a machine.  And I have no doubt that it will be so.  Up to the present, man has been, to a certain extent, the slave of machinery, and there is something tragic in the fact that as soon as man had invented a machine to do his work he began to starve.  This, however, is, of course, the result of our property system and our system of competition.  One man owns a machine which does the work of five hundred men.  Five hundred men are, in consequence, thrown out of employment, and, having no work to do, become hungry and take to thieving.  The one man secures the produce of the machine and keeps it, and has five hundred times as much as he should have, and probably, which is of much more importance, a great deal more than he really wants.  Were that machine the property of all, every one would benefit by it.  It would be an immense advantage to the community. All unintellectual labour, all monotonous, dull labour, all labour that deals with dreadful things, and involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by machinery.  Machinery must work for us in coal mines, and do all sanitary services, and be the stoker of steamers, and clean the streets, and run messages on wet days, and do anything that is tedious or distressing.  At present machinery competes against man.  Under proper conditions machinery will serve man.  There is no doubt at all that this is the future of machinery, and just as trees grow while the country gentleman is asleep, so while Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure?which, and not labour, is the aim of man?or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.  The fact is, that civilisation requires slaves.  The Greeks were quite right there.  Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible.  Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralising.  On mechanical slavery, on the slavery of the machine, the future of the world depends.  And when scientific men are no longer called upon to go down to a depressing East End and distribute bad cocoa and worse blankets to starving people, they will have delightful leisure in which to devise wonderful and marvellous things for their own joy and the joy of everyone else.  There will be great storages of force for every city, and for every house if required, and this force man will convert into heat, light, or motion, according to his needs.  Is this Utopian?  A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which Humanity is always landing.  And when Humanity lands there, it looks out, and, seeing a better country, sets sail.  Progress is the realisation of Utopias.  Now, I have said that the community by means of organisation of machinery will supply the useful things, and that the beautiful things will be made by the individual.  This is not merely necessary, but it is the only possible way by which we can get either the one or the other.  An individual who has to make things for the use of others, and with reference to their wants and their wishes, does not work with interest, and consequently cannot put into his work what is best in him.  Upon the other hand, whenever a community or a powerful section of a community, or a government of any kind, attempts to dictate to the artist what he is to do, Art either entirely vanishes, or becomes stereotyped, or degenerates into a low and ignoble form of craft.  A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament.  Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is.  It has nothing to do with the fact that other people want what they want.  Indeed, the moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want, and tries to supply the demand, he ceases to be an artist, and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman, an honest or a dishonest tradesman.  He has no further claim to be considered as an artist.  Art is the most intense mode of Individualism that the world has known.  I am inclined to say that it is the only real mode of Individualism that the world has known.  Crime, which, under certain conditions, may seem to have created Individualism, must take cognisance of other people and interfere with them.  It belongs to the sphere of action.  But alone, without any reference to his neighbours, without any interference, the artist can fashion a beautiful thing; and if he does not do it solely for his own pleasure, he is not an artist at all.  And it is to be noted that it is the fact that Art is this intense form of Individualism that makes the public try to exercise over it in an authority that is as immoral as it is ridiculous, and as corrupting as it is contemptible.  It is not quite their fault.  The public has always, and in every age, been badly brought up.  They are continually asking Art to be popular, to please their want of taste, to flatter their absurd vanity, to tell them what they have been told before, to show them what they ought to be tired of seeing, to amuse them when they feel heavy after eating too much, and to distract their thoughts when they are wearied of their own stupidity.  Now Art should never try to be popular. The public should try to make itself artistic.  There is a very wide difference.  If a man of science were told that the results of his experiments, and the conclusions that he arrived at, should be of such a character that they would not upset the received popular notions on the subject, or disturb popular prejudice, or hurt the sensibilities of people who knew nothing about science; if a philosopher were told that he had a perfect right to speculate in the highest spheres of thought, provided that he arrived at the same conclusions as were held by those who had never thought in any sphere at all?well, nowadays the man of science and the philosopher would be considerably amused.  Yet it is really a very few years since both philosophy and science were subjected to brutal popular control, to authority in fact?the authority of either the general ignorance of the community, or the terror and greed for power of an ecclesiastical or governmental class.  Of course, we have to a very great extent got rid of any attempt on the part of the community, or the Church, or the Government, to interfere with the individualism of speculative thought, but the attempt to interfere with the individualism of imaginative art still lingers.  In fact, it does more than linger; it is aggressive, offensive, and brutalising.  In England, the arts that have escaped best are the arts in which the public take no interest.  Poetry is an instance of what I mean.  We have been able to have fine poetry in England because the public do not read it, and consequently do not influence it.  The public like to insult poets because they are individual, but once they have insulted them, they leave them alone.  In the case of the novel and the drama, arts in which the public do take an interest, the result of the exercise of popular authority has been absolutely ridiculous.  No country produces such badly-written fiction, such tedious, common work in the novel form, such silly, vulgar plays as England.  It must necessarily be so.  The popular standard is of such a character that no artist can get to it.  It is at once too easy and too difficult to be a popular novelist.  It is too easy, because the requirements of the public as far as plot, style, psychology, treatment of life, and treatment of literature are concerned are within the reach of the very meanest capacity and the most uncultivated mind.  It is too difficult, because to meet such requirements the artist would have to do violence to his temperament, would have to write not for the artistic joy of writing, but for the amusement of half-educated people, and so would have to suppress his individualism, forget his culture, annihilate his style, and surrender everything that is valuable in him.  In the case of the drama, things are a little better: the theatre-going public like the obvious, it is true, but they do not like the tedious; and burlesque and farcical comedy, the two most popular forms, are distinct forms of art.  Delightful work may be produced under burlesque and farcical conditions, and in work of this kind the artist in England is allowed very great freedom.  It is when one comes to the higher forms of the drama that the result of popular control is seen.  The one thing that the public dislike is novelty.  Any attempt to extend the subject-matter of art is extremely distasteful to the public; and yet the vitality and progress of art depend in a large measure on the continual extension of subject-matter.  The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it.  It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses.  The public are quite right in their attitude.  Art is Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force.  Therein lies its immense value.  For what it seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.  In Art, the public accept what has been, because they cannot alter it, not because they appreciate it.  They swallow their classics whole, and never taste them.  They endure them as the inevitable, and as they cannot mar them, they mouth about them.  Strangely enough, or not strangely, according to one's own views, this acceptance of the classics does a great deal of harm.  The uncritical admiration of the Bible and Shakespeare in England is an instance of what I mean.  With regard to the Bible, considerations of ecclesiastical authority enter into the matter, so that I need not dwell upon the point.  But in the case of Shakespeare it is quite obvious that the public really see neither the beauties nor the defects of his plays.  If they saw the beauties, they would not object to the development of the drama; and if they saw the defects, they would not object to the development of the drama either.  The fact is, the public make use of the classics of a country as a means of checking the progress of Art.  They degrade the classics into authorities.  They use them as bludgeons for preventing the free expression of Beauty in new forms.  They are always asking a writer why he does not write like somebody else, or a painter why he does not paint like somebody else, quite oblivious of the fact that if either of them did anything of the kind he would cease to be an artist.  A fresh mode of Beauty is absolutely distasteful to them, and whenever it appears they get so angry, and bewildered that they always use two stupid expressions?one is that the work of art is grossly unintelligible; the other, that the work of art is grossly immoral.  What they mean by these words seems to me to be this.  When they say a work is grossly unintelligible, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is new; when they describe a work as grossly immoral, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is true. The former expression has reference to style; the latter to subject-matter.  But they probably use the words very vaguely, as an ordinary mob will use ready-made paving-stones.  There is not a single real poet or prose-writer of this century, for instance, on whom the British public have not solemnly conferred diplomas of immorality, and these diplomas practically take the place, with us, of what in France, is the formal recognition of an Academy of Letters, and fortunately make the establishment of such an institution quite unnecessary in England.  Of course, the public are very reckless in their use of the word.  That they should have called Wordsworth an immoral poet, was only to be expected. Wordsworth was a poet.  But that they should have called Charles Kingsley an immoral novelist is extraordinary.  Kingsley's prose was not of a very fine quality.  Still, there is the word, and they use it as best they can.  An artist is, of course, not disturbed by it.  The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself, because he is absolutely himself. But I can fancy that if an artist produced a work of art in England that immediately on its appearance was recognised by the public, through their medium, which is the public press, as a work that was quite intelligible and highly moral, he would begin to seriously question whether in its creation he had really been himself at all, and consequently whether the work was not quite unworthy of him, and either of a thoroughly second-rate order, or of no artistic value whatsoever.  Perhaps, however, I have wronged the public in limiting them to such words as ?immoral,? ?unintelligible,? ?exotic,? and ?unhealthy.?  There is one other word that they use.  That word is ?morbid.?  They do not use it often.  The meaning of the word is so simple that they are afraid of using it.  Still, they use it sometimes, and, now and then, one comes across it in popular newspapers.  It is, of course, a ridiculous word to apply to a work of art.  For what is morbidity but a mood of emotion or a mode of thought that one cannot express?  The public are all morbid, because the public can never find expression for anything.  The artist is never morbid.  He expresses everything.  He stands outside his subject, and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects.  To call an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as his subject-matter is as silly as if one called Shakespeare mad because he wrote ?King Lear.?  On the whole, an artist in England gains something by being attacked. His individuality is intensified.  He becomes more completely himself. Of course, the attacks are very gross, very impertinent, and very contemptible.  But then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or style from the suburban intellect.  Vulgarity and stupidity are two very vivid facts in modern life.  One regrets them, naturally.  But there they are.  They are subjects for study, like everything else.  And it is only fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in public.  Within the last few years two other adjectives, it may be mentioned, have been added to the very limited vocabulary of art-abuse that is at the disposal of the public.  One is the word ?unhealthy,? the other is the word ?exotic.?  The latter merely expresses the rage of the momentary mushroom against the immortal, entrancing, and exquisitely lovely orchid. It is a tribute, but a tribute of no importance.  The word ?unhealthy,? however, admits of analysis.  It is a rather interesting word.  In fact, it is so interesting that the people who use it do not know what it means.  What does it mean?  What is a healthy, or an unhealthy work of art?  All terms that one applies to a work of art, provided that one applies them rationally, have reference to either its style or its subject, or to both together.  From the point of view of style, a healthy work of art is one whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs, be that material one of words or of bronze, of colour or of ivory, and uses that beauty as a factor in producing the 'sthetic effect.  From the point of view of subject, a healthy work of art is one the choice of whose subject is conditioned by the temperament of the artist, and comes directly out of it.  In fine, a healthy work of art is one that has both perfection and personality.  Of course, form and substance cannot be separated in a work of art; they are always one.  But for purposes of analysis, and setting the wholeness of 'sthetic impression aside for a moment, we can intellectually so separate them.  An unhealthy work of art, on the other hand, is a work whose style is obvious, old-fashioned, and common, and whose subject is deliberately chosen, not because the artist has any pleasure in it, but because he thinks that the public will pay him for it.  In fact, the popular novel that the public calls healthy is always a thoroughly unhealthy production; and what the public call an unhealthy novel is always a beautiful and healthy work of art.  I need hardly say that I am not, for a single moment, complaining that the public and the public press misuse these words.  I do not see how, with their lack of comprehension of what Art is, they could possibly use them in the proper sense.  I am merely pointing out the misuse; and as for the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it all, the explanation is very simple.  It comes from the barbarous conception of authority.  It comes from the natural inability of a community corrupted by authority to understand or appreciate Individualism.  In a word, it comes from that monstrous and ignorant thing that is called Public Opinion, which, bad and well-meaning as it is when it tries to control action, is infamous and of evil meaning when it tries to control Thought or Art.  Indeed, there is much more to be said in favour of the physical force of the public than there is in favour of the public's opinion.  The former may be fine.  The latter must be foolish.  It is often said that force is no argument.  That, however, entirely depends on what one wants to prove. Many of the most important problems of the last few centuries, such as the continuance of personal government in England, or of feudalism in France, have been solved entirely by means of physical force.  The very violence of a revolution may make the public grand and splendid for a moment.  It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat.  They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant.  It is greatly to be regretted, for both their sakes.  Behind the barricade there may be much that is noble and heroic.  But what is there behind the leading-article but prejudice, stupidity, cant, and twaddle?  And when these four are joined together they make a terrible force, and constitute the new authority.  In old days men had the rack.  Now they have the press.  That is an improvement certainly.  But still it is very bad, and wrong, and demoralising.  Somebody?was it Burke??called journalism the fourth estate.  That was true at the time, no doubt.  But at the present moment it really is the only estate.  It has eaten up the other three.  The Lords Temporal say nothing, the Lords Spiritual have nothing to say, and the House of Commons has nothing to say and says it.  We are dominated by Journalism.  In America the President reigns for four years, and Journalism governs for ever and ever.  Fortunately in America Journalism has carried its authority to the grossest and most brutal extreme.  As a natural consequence it has begun to create a spirit of revolt.  People are amused by it, or disgusted by it, according to their temperaments. But it is no longer the real force it was.  It is not seriously treated. In England, Journalism, not, except in a few well-known instances, having been carried to such excesses of brutality, is still a great factor, a really remarkable power.  The tyranny that it proposes to exercise over people's private lives seems to me to be quite extraordinary.  The fact is, that the public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing.  Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands.  In centuries before ours the public nailed the ears of journalists to the pump.  That was quite hideous.  In this century journalists have nailed their own ears to the keyhole.  That is much worse.  And what aggravates the mischief is that the journalists who are most to blame are not the amusing journalists who write for what are called Society p|2
87|apers.  The harm is done by the serious, thoughtful, earnest journalists, who solemnly, as they are doing at present, will drag before the eyes of the public some incident in the private life of a great statesman, of a man who is a leader of political thought as he is a creator of political force, and invite the public to discuss the incident, to exercise authority in the matter, to give their views, and not merely to give their views, but to carry them into action, to dictate to the man upon all other points, to dictate to his party, to dictate to his country; in fact, to make themselves ridiculous, offensive, and harmful.  The private lives of men and women should not be told to the public.  The public have nothing to do with them at all.  In France they manage these things better.  There they do not allow the details of the trials that take place in the divorce courts to be published for the amusement or criticism of the public.  All that the public are allowed to know is that the divorce has taken place and was granted on petition of one or other or both of the married parties concerned.  In France, in fact, they limit the journalist, and allow the artist almost perfect freedom.  Here we allow absolute freedom to the journalist, and entirely limit the artist.  English public opinion, that is to say, tries to constrain and impede and warp the man who makes things that are beautiful in effect, and compels the journalist to retail things that are ugly, or disgusting, or revolting in fact, so that we have the most serious journalists in the world, and the most indecent newspapers.  It is no exaggeration to talk of compulsion.  There are possibly some journalists who take a real pleasure in publishing horrible things, or who, being poor, look to scandals as forming a sort of permanent basis for an income.  But there are other journalists, I feel certain, men of education and cultivation, who really dislike publishing these things, who know that it is wrong to do so, and only do it because the unhealthy conditions under which their occupation is carried on oblige them to supply the public with what the public wants, and to compete with other journalists in making that supply as full and satisfying to the gross popular appetite as possible.  It is a very degrading position for any body of educated men to be placed in, and I have no doubt that most of them feel it acutely.  However, let us leave what is really a very sordid side of the subject, and return to the question of popular control in the matter of Art, by which I mean Public Opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is to use it, and the materials with which he is to work.  I have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England are the arts in which the public have not been interested. They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years, it is important to point out that this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a mere matter of demand and supply.  With his marvellous and vivid personality, with a style that has really a true colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation, Mr Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted, could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner, and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire.  But his object was not that.  His object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art.  At first he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many.  He has created in the public both taste and temperament.  The public appreciate his artistic success immensely.  I often wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success is entirely due to the fact that he did not accept their standard, but realised his own.  With their standard the Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of the popular theatres in London are at present.  Whether they understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public, and that the public is capable of developing these qualities.  The problem then is, why do not the public become more civilised?  They have the capacity.  What stops them?  The thing that stops them, it must be said again, is their desire to exercise authority over the artist and over works of art.  To certain theatres, such as the Lyceum and the Haymarket, the public seem to come in a proper mood.  In both of these theatres there have been individual artists, who have succeeded in creating in their audiences?and every theatre in London has its own audience?the temperament to which Art appeals.  And what is that temperament?  It is the temperament of receptivity.  That is all.  If a man approaches a work of art with any desire to exercise authority over it and the artist, he approaches it in such a spirit that he cannot receive any artistic impression from it at all.  The work of art is to dominate the spectator: the spectator is not to dominate the work of art. The spectator is to be receptive.  He is to be the violin on which the master is to play.  And the more completely he can suppress his own silly views, his own foolish prejudices, his own absurd ideas of what Art should be, or should not be, the more likely he is to understand and appreciate the work of art in question.  This is, of course, quite obvious in the case of the vulgar theatre-going public of English men and women.  But it is equally true of what are called educated people.  For an educated person's ideas of Art are drawn naturally from what Art has been, whereas the new work of art is beautiful by being what Art has never been; and to measure it by the standard of the past is to measure it by a standard on the rejection of which its real perfection depends. A temperament capable of receiving, through an imaginative medium, and under imaginative conditions, new and beautiful impressions, is the only temperament that can appreciate a work of art.  And true as this is in the case of the appreciation of sculpture and painting, it is still more true of the appreciation of such arts as the drama.  For a picture and a statue are not at war with Time.  They take no count of its succession. In one moment their unity may be apprehended.  In the case of literature it is different.  Time must be traversed before the unity of effect is realised.  And so, in the drama, there may occur in the first act of the play something whose real artistic value may not be evident to the spectator till the third or fourth act is reached.  Is the silly fellow to get angry and call out, and disturb the play, and annoy the artists? No.  The honest man is to sit quietly, and know the delightful emotions of wonder, curiosity, and suspense.  He is not to go to the play to lose a vulgar temper.  He is to go to the play to realise an artistic temperament.  He is to go to the play to gain an artistic temperament. He is not the arbiter of the work of art.  He is one who is admitted to contemplate the work of art, and, if the work be fine, to forget in its contemplation and the egotism that mars him?the egotism of his ignorance, or the egotism of his information.  This point about the drama is hardly, I think, sufficiently recognised.  I can quite understand that were ?Macbeth? produced for the first time before a modern London audience, many of the people present would strongly and vigorously object to the introduction of the witches in the first act, with their grotesque phrases and their ridiculous words.  But when the play is over one realises that the laughter of the witches in ?Macbeth? is as terrible as the laughter of madness in ?Lear,? more terrible than the laughter of Iago in the tragedy of the Moor.  No spectator of art needs a more perfect mood of receptivity than the spectator of a play.  The moment he seeks to exercise authority he becomes the avowed enemy of Art and of himself.  Art does not mind.  It is he who suffers.  With the novel it is the same thing.  Popular authority and the recognition of popular authority are fatal.  Thackeray's ?Esmond? is a beautiful work of art because he wrote it to please himself.  In his other novels, in ?Pendennis,? in ?Philip,? in ?Vanity Fair? even, at times, he is too conscious of the public, and spoils his work by appealing directly to the sympathies of the public, or by directly mocking at them.  A true artist takes no notice whatever of the public. The public are to him non-existent.  He has no poppied or honeyed cakes through which to give the monster sleep or sustenance.  He leaves that to the popular novelist.  One incomparable novelist we have now in England, Mr George Meredith.  There are better artists in France, but France has no one whose view of life is so large, so varied, so imaginatively true. There are tellers of stories in Russia who have a more vivid sense of what pain in fiction may be.  But to him belongs philosophy in fiction. His people not merely live, but they live in thought.  One can see them from myriad points of view.  They are suggestive.  There is soul in them and around them.  They are interpretative and symbolic.  And he who made them, those wonderful quickly-moving figures, made them for his own pleasure, and has never asked the public what they wanted, has never cared to know what they wanted, has never allowed the public to dictate to him or influence him in any way but has gone on intensifying his own personality, and producing his own individual work.  At first none came to him.  That did not matter.  Then the few came to him.  That did not change him.  The many have come now.  He is still the same.  He is an incomparable novelist.  With the decorative arts it is not different.  The public clung with really pathetic tenacity to what I believe were the direct traditions of the Great Exhibition of international vulgarity, traditions that were so appalling that the houses in which people lived were only fit for blind people to live in.  Beautiful things began to be made, beautiful colours came from the dyer's hand, beautiful patterns from the artist's brain, and the use of beautiful things and their value and importance were set forth.  The public were really very indignant.  They lost their temper. They said silly things.  No one minded.  No one was a whit the worse.  No one accepted the authority of public opinion.  And now it is almost impossible to enter any modern house without seeing some recognition of good taste, some recognition of the value of lovely surroundings, some sign of appreciation of beauty.  In fact, people's houses are, as a rule, quite charming nowadays.  People have been to a very great extent civilised.  It is only fair to state, however, that the extraordinary success of the revolution in house-decoration and furniture and the like has not really been due to the majority of the public developing a very fine taste in such matters.  It has been chiefly due to the fact that the craftsmen of things so appreciated the pleasure of making what was beautiful, and woke to such a vivid consciousness of the hideousness and vulgarity of what the public had previously wanted, that they simply starved the public out.  It would be quite impossible at the present moment to furnish a room as rooms were furnished a few years ago, without going for everything to an auction of second-hand furniture from some third-rate lodging-house.  The things are no longer made.  However they may object to it, people must nowadays have something charming in their surroundings.  Fortunately for them, their assumption of authority in these art-matters came to entire grief.  It is evident, then, that all authority in such things is bad.  People sometimes inquire what form of government is most suitable for an artist to live under.  To this question there is only one answer.  The form of government that is most suitable to the artist is no government at all. Authority over him and his art is ridiculous.  It has been stated that under despotisms artists have produced lovely work.  This is not quite so.  Artists have visited despots, not as subjects to be tyrannised over, but as wandering wonder-makers, as fascinating vagrant personalities, to be entertained and charmed and suffered to be at peace, and allowed to create.  There is this to be said in favour of the despot, that he, being an individual, may have culture, while the mob, being a monster, has none.  One who is an Emperor and King may stoop down to pick up a brush for a painter, but when the democracy stoops down it is merely to throw mud.  And yet the democracy have not so far to stoop as the emperor.  In fact, when they want to throw mud they have not to stoop at all.  But there is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.  There are three kinds of despots.  There is the despot who tyrannises over the body.  There is the despot who tyrannises over the soul.  There is the despot who tyrannises over the soul and body alike.  The first is called the Prince.  The second is called the Pope.  The third is called the People.  The Prince may be cultivated.  Many Princes have been.  Yet in the Prince there is danger.  One thinks of Dante at the bitter feast in Verona, of Tasso in Ferrara's madman's cell.  It is better for the artist not to live with Princes.  The Pope may be cultivated.  Many Popes have been; the bad Popes have been.  The bad Popes loved Beauty, almost as passionately, nay, with as much passion as the good Popes hated Thought.  To the wickedness of the Papacy humanity owes much.  The goodness of the Papacy owes a terrible debt to humanity.  Yet, though the Vatican has kept the rhetoric of its thunders, and lost the rod of its lightning, it is better for the artist not to live with Popes.  It was a Pope who said of Cellini to a conclave of Cardinals that common laws and common authority were not made for men such as he; but it was a Pope who thrust Cellini into prison, and kept him there till he sickened with rage, and created unreal visions for himself, and saw the gilded sun enter his room, and grew so enamoured of it that he sought to escape, and crept out from tower to tower, and falling through dizzy air at dawn, maimed himself, and was by a vine-dresser covered with vine leaves, and carried in a cart to one who, loving beautiful things, had care of him. There is danger in Popes.  And as for the People, what of them and their authority?  Perhaps of them and their authority one has spoken enough. Their authority is a thing blind, deaf, hideous, grotesque, tragic, amusing, serious, and obscene.  It is impossible for the artist to live with the People.  All despots bribe.  The people bribe and brutalise. Who told them to exercise authority?  They were made to live, to listen, and to love.  Someone has done them a great wrong.  They have marred themselves by imitation of their inferiors.  They have taken the sceptre of the Prince.  How should they use it?  They have taken the triple tiara of the Pope.  How should they carry its burden?  They are as a clown whose heart is broken.  They are as a priest whose soul is not yet born. Let all who love Beauty pity them.  Though they themselves love not Beauty, yet let them pity themselves.  Who taught them the trick of tyranny?  There are many other things that one might point out.  One might point out how the Renaissance was great, because it sought to solve no social problem, and busied itself not about such things, but suffered the individual to develop freely, beautifully, and naturally, and so had great and individual artists, and great and individual men.  One might point out how Louis XIV., by creating the modern state, destroyed the individualism of the artist, and made things monstrous in their monotony of repetition, and contemptible in their conformity to rule, and destroyed throughout all France all those fine freedoms of expression that had made tradition new in beauty, and new modes one with antique form.  But the past is of no importance.  The present is of no importance.  It is with the future that we have to deal.  For the past is what man should not have been.  The present is what man ought not to be. The future is what artists are.  It will, of course, be said that such a scheme as is set forth here is quite unpractical, and goes against human nature.  This is perfectly true.  It is unpractical, and it goes against human nature.  This is why it is worth carrying out, and that is why one proposes it.  For what is a practical scheme?  A practical scheme is either a scheme that is already in existence, or a scheme that could be carried out under existing conditions.  But it is exactly the existing conditions that one objects to; and any scheme that could accept these conditions is wrong and foolish.  The conditions will be done away with, and human nature will change.  The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes.  Change is the one quality we can predicate of it.  The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature, and not on its growth and development.  The error of Louis XIV. was that he thought human nature would always be the same.  The result of his error was the French Revolution.  It was an admirable result.  All the results of the mistakes of governments are quite admirable.  It is to be noted also that Individualism does not come to man with any sickly cant about duty, which merely means doing what other people want because they want it; or any hideous cant about self-sacrifice, which is merely a survival of savage mutilation.  In fact, it does not come to man with any claims upon him at all.  It comes naturally and inevitably out of man.  It is the point to which all development tends.  It is the differentiation to which all organisms grow.  It is the perfection that is inherent in every mode of life, and towards which every mode of life quickens.  And so Individualism exercises no compulsion over man.  On the contrary, it says to man that he should suffer no compulsion to be exercised over him.  It does not try to force people to be good.  It knows that people are good when they are let alone.  Man will develop Individualism out of himself.  Man is now so developing Individualism. To ask whether Individualism is practical is like asking whether Evolution is practical.  Evolution is the law of life, and there is no evolution except towards Individualism.  Where this tendency is not expressed, it is a case of artificially-arrested growth, or of disease, or of death.  Individualism will also be unselfish and unaffected.  It has been pointed out that one of the results of the extraordinary tyranny of authority is that words are absolutely distorted from their proper and simple meaning, and are used to express the obverse of their right signification.  What is true about Art is true about Life.  A man is called affected, nowadays, if he dresses as he likes to dress.  But in doing that he is acting in a perfectly natural manner.  Affectation, in such matters, consists in dressing according to the views of one's neighbour, whose views, as they are the views of the majority, will probably be extremely stupid.  Or a man is called selfish if he lives in the manner that seems to him most suitable for the full realisation of his own personality; if, in fact, the primary aim of his life is self-development.  But this is the way in which everyone should live.  Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.  And unselfishness is letting other people's lives alone, not interfering with them.  Selfishness always aims at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type.  Unselfishness recognises infinite variety of type as a delightful thing, accepts it, acquiesces in it, enjoys it.  It is not selfish to think for oneself.  A man who does not think for himself does not think at all.  It is grossly selfish to require of ones neighbour that he should think in the same way, and hold the same opinions.  Why should he?  If he can think, he will probably think differently.  If he cannot think, it is monstrous to require thought of any kind from him.  A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose.  It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.  Under Individualism people will be quite natural and absolutely unselfish, and will know the meanings of the words, and realise them in their free, beautiful lives.  Nor will men be egotistic as they are now.  For the egotist is he who makes claims upon others, and the Individualist will not desire to do that.  It will not give him pleasure.  When man has realised Individualism, he will also realise sympathy and exercise it freely and spontaneously.  Up to the present man has hardly cultivated sympathy at all.  He has merely sympathy with pain, and sympathy with pain is not the highest form of sympathy.  All sympathy is fine, but sympathy with suffering is the least fine mode.  It is tainted with egotism.  It is apt to become morbid.  There is in it a certain element of terror for our own safety.  We become afraid that we ourselves might be as the leper or as the blind, and that no man would have care of us.  It is curiously limiting, too.  One should sympathise with the entirety of life, not with life's sores and maladies merely, but with life's joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom.  The wider sympathy is, of course, the more difficult.  It requires more unselfishness.  Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature?it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist?to sympathise with a friend's success.  In the modern stress of competition and struggle for place, such sympathy is naturally rare, and is also very much stifled by the immoral ideal of uniformity of type and conformity to rule which is so prevalent everywhere, and is perhaps most obnoxious in England.  Sympathy with pain there will, of course, always be.  It is one of the first instincts of man.  The animals which are individual, the higher animals, that is to say, share it with us.  But it must be remembered that while sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the world, sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain.  It may make man better able to endure evil, but the evil remains.  Sympathy with consumption does not cure consumption; that is what Science does.  And when Socialism has solved the problem of poverty, and Science solved the problem of disease, the area of the sentimentalists will be lessened, and the sympathy of man will be large, healthy, and spontaneous.  Man will have joy in the contemplation of the joyous life of others.  For it is through joy that the Individualism of the future will develop itself.  Christ made no attempt to reconstruct society, and consequently the Individualism that he preached to man could be realised only through pain or in solitude.  The ideals that we owe to Christ are the ideals of the man who abandons society entirely, or of the man who resists society absolutely.  But man is naturally social.  Even the Thebaid became peopled at last.  And though the cenobite realises his personality, it is often an impoverished personality that he so realises.  Upon the other hand, the terrible truth that pain is a mode through which man may realise himself exercises a wonderful fascination over the world. Shallow speakers and shallow thinkers in pulpits and on platforms often talk about the world's worship of pleasure, and whine against it.  But it is rarely in the world's history that its ideal has been one of joy and beauty.  The worship of pain has far more often dominated the world. Medi?valism, with its saints and martyrs, its love of self-torture, its wild passion for wounding itself, its gashing with knives, and its whipping with rods?Medi?valism is real Christianity, and the medi?val Christ is the real Christ.  When the Renaissance dawned upon the world, and brought with it the new ideals of the beauty of life and the joy of living, men could not understand Christ.  Even Art shows us that.  The painters of the Renaissance drew Christ as a little boy playing with another boy in a palace or a garden, or lying back in his mother's arms, smiling at her, or at a flower, or at a bright bird; or as a noble, stately figure moving nobly through the world; or as a wonderful figure rising in a sort of ecstasy from death to life.  Even when they drew him crucified they drew him as a beautiful God on whom evil men had inflicted suffering.  But he did not preoccupy them much.  What delighted them was to paint the men and women whom they admired, and to show the loveliness of this lovely earth.  They painted many religious pictures?in fact, they painted far too many, and the monotony of type and motive is wearisome, and was bad for art.  It was the result of the authority of the public in art-matters, and is to be deplored.  But their soul was not in the subject.  Raphael was a great artist when he painted his portrait of the Pope.  When he painted his Madonnas and infant Christs, he is not a great artist at all.  Christ had no message for the Renaissance, which was wonderful because it brought an ideal at variance with his, and to find the presentation of the real Christ we must go to medi?val art.  There he is one maimed and marred; one who is not comely to look on, because Beauty is a joy; one who is not in fair raiment, because that may be a joy also: he is a beggar who has a marvellous soul; he is a leper whose soul is divine; he needs neither property nor health; he is a God realising his perfection through pain.  The evolution of man is slow.  The injustice of men is great.  It was necessary that pain should be put forward as a mode of self-realisation. Even now, in some places in the world, the message of Christ is necessary.  No one who lived in modern Russia could possibly realise his perfection except by pain.  A few Russian artists have realised themselves in Art; in a fiction that is medi?val in character, because its dominant note is the realisation of men through suffering.  But for those who are not artists, and to whom there is no mode of life but the actual life of fact, pain is the only door to perfection.  A Russian who lives happily under the present system of government in Russia must either believe that man has no soul, or that, if he has, it is not worth developing.  A Nihilist who rejects all authority, because he knows authority to be evil, and welcomes all pain, because through that he realises his personality, is a real Christian.  To him the Christian ideal is a true thing.  And yet, Christ did not revolt against authority.  He accepted the imperial authority of the Roman Empire and paid tribute.  He endured the ecclesiastical authority of the Jewish Church, and would not repel its violence by any violence of his own.  He had, as I said before, no scheme for the reconstruction of society.  But the modern world has schemes.  It proposes to do away with poverty and the suffering that it entails.  It desires to get rid of pain, and the suffering that pain entails.  It trusts to Socialism and to Science as its methods.  What it aims at is an Individualism expressing itself through joy.  This Individualism will be larger, fuller, lovelier than any Individualism has ever been.  Pain is not the ultimate mode of perfection.  It is merely provisional and a protest.  It has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust surroundings. When the wrong, and the disease, and the injustice are removed, it will have no further place.  It will have done its work.  It was a great work, but it is almost over.  Its sphere lessens every day.  Nor will man miss it.  For what man has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life.  Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly.  When he can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himsel|2
88|"f.  Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval.  When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment.  The new Individualism, for whose service Socialism, whether it wills it or not, is working, will be perfect harmony.  It will be what the Greeks sought for, but could not, except in Thought, realise completely, because they had slaves, and fed them; it will be what the Renaissance sought for, but could not realise completely except in Art, because they had slaves, and starved them.  It will be complete, and through it each man will attain to his perfection. The new Individualism is the new Hellenism.   PROLOGUE.  SCENE.--_A Russian Inn._  _Large door opening on snowy landscape at back of stage._  _PETER SABOUROFF and MICHAEL._   PETER (_warming his hands at a stove_). Has Vera not come back yet, Michael?  MICH. No, Father Peter, not yet; 'tis a good three miles to the post office, and she has to milk the cows besides, and that dun one is a rare plaguey creature for a wench to handle.  PETER. Why didn't you go with her, you young fool? she'll never love you unless you are always at her heels; women like to be bothered.  MICH. She says I bother her too much already, Father Peter, and I fear she'll never love me after all.  PETER. Tut, tut, boy, why shouldn't she? you're young and wouldn't be ill-favoured either, had God or thy mother given thee another face. Aren't you one of Prince Maraloffski's gamekeepers; and haven't you got a good grass farm, and the best cow in the village? What more does a girl want?  MICH. But Vera, Father Peter--  PETER. Vera, my lad, has got too many ideas; I don't think much of ideas myself; I've got on well enough in life without 'em; why shouldn't my children? There's Dmitri! could have stayed here and kept the inn; many a young lad would have jumped at the offer in these hard times; but he, scatter-brained featherhead of a boy, must needs go off to Moscow to study the law! What does he want knowing about the law! let a man do his duty, say I, and no one will trouble him.  MICH. Ay! but Father Peter, they say a good lawyer can break the law as often as he likes, and no one can say him nay.  PETER. That is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?  MICH. Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone astray--perhaps the new postman can't read; he looks stupid enough, and Dmitri, why, he was the best fellow in the village. Do you remember how he shot the bear at the barn in the great winter?  PETER. Ay, it was a good shot; I never did a better myself.  MICH. And as for dancing, he tired out three fiddlers Christmas come two years.  PETER. Ay, ay, he was a merry lad. It is the girl that has the seriousness--she goes about as solemn as a priest for days at a time.  MICH. Vera is always thinking of others.  PETER. There is her mistake, boy. Let God and our Little Father look to the world. It is none of my work to mend my neighbour's thatch. Why, last winter old Michael was frozen to death in his sleigh in the snowstorm, and his wife and children starved afterwards when the hard times came; but what business was it of mine? I didn't make the world. Let God and the Czar look to it. And then the blight came, and the black plague with it, and the priests couldn't bury the people fast enough, and they lay dead on the roads--men and women both. But what business was it of mine? I didn't make the world. Let God and the Czar look to it. Or two autumns ago, when the river overflowed on a sudden, and the children's school was carried away and drowned every girl and boy in it. I didn't make the world--let God and the Czar look to it.  MICH. But, Father Peter--  PETER. No, no, boy; no man could live if he took his neighbour's pack on his shoulders. (_Enter VERA in peasant's dress._) Well, my girl, you've been long enough away--where is the letter?  VERA. There is none to-day, Father.  PETER. I knew it.  VERA. But there will be one to-morrow, Father.  PETER. Curse him, for an ungrateful son.  VERA. Oh, Father, don't say that; he must be sick.  PETER. Ay! sick of profligacy, perhaps.  VERA. How dare you say that of him, Father? You know that is not true.  PETER. Where does the money go, then? Michael, listen. I gave Dmitri half his mother's fortune to bring with him to pay the lawyer folk of Moscow. He has only written three times, and every time for more money. He got it, not at my wish, but at hers (_pointing to VERA_), and now for five months, close on six almost, we have heard nothing from him.  VERA. Father, he will come back.  PETER. Ay! the prodigals always return; but let him never darken my doors again.  VERA (_sitting down pensive_). Some evil has come on him; he must be dead! Oh! Michael, I am so wretched about Dmitri.  MICH. Will you never love any one but him, Vera?  VERA (_smiling_). I don't know; there is so much else to do in the world but love.  MICH. Nothing else worth doing, Vera.  PETER. What noise is that, Vera? (_A metallic clink is heard._)  VERA (_rising and going to the door_). I don't know, Father; it is not like the cattle bells, or I would think Nicholas had come from the fair. Oh! Father! it is soldiers!--coming down the hill--there is one of them on horseback. How pretty they look! But there are some men with them with chains on! They must be robbers. Oh! don't let them in, Father; I couldn't look at them.  PETER. Men in chains! Why, we are in luck, my child! I heard this was to be the new road to Siberia, to bring the prisoners to the mines; but I didn't believe it. My fortune is made! Bustle, Vera, bustle! I'll die a rich man after all. There will be no lack of good customers now. An honest man should have the chance of making his living out of rascals now and then.  VERA. Are these men rascals, Father? What have they done?  PETER. I reckon they're some of those Nihilists the priest warns us against. Don't stand there idle, my girl.  VERA. I suppose, then, they are all wicked men.  (_Sound of soldiers outside; cry of ""Halt!"" enter Russian officer with a body of soldiers and eight men in chains, raggedly dressed; one of them on entering hurriedly puts his coat above his ears and hides his face; some soldiers guard the door, others sit down; the prisoners stand._)  COLONEL. Innkeeper!  PETER. Yes, Colonel.  COLONEL (_pointing to Nihilists_). Give these men some bread and water.  PETER (_to himself_). I shan't make much out of that order.  COLONEL. As for myself, what have you got fit to eat?  PETER. Some good dried venison, your Excellency--and some rye whisky.  COLONEL. Nothing else?  PETER. Why, more whisky, your Excellency.  COLONEL. What clods these peasants are! You have a better room than this?  PETER. Yes, sir.  COLONEL. Bring me there. Sergeant, post your picket outside, and see that these scoundrels do not communicate with any one. No letter writing, you dogs, or you'll be flogged for it. Now for the venison. (_To PETER bowing before him._) Get out of the way, you fool! Who is that girl? (_sees VERA_).  PETER. My daughter, your Highness.  COLONEL. Can she read and write?  PETER. Ay, that she can, sir.  COLONEL. Then she is a dangerous woman. No peasant should be allowed to do anything of the kind. Till your fields, store your harvests, pay your taxes, and obey your masters--that is your duty.  VERA. Who are our masters?  COLONEL. Young woman, these men are going to the mines for life for asking the same foolish question.  VERA. Then they have been unjustly condemned.  PETER. Vera, keep your tongue quiet. She is a foolish girl, sir, who talks too much.  COLONEL. Every woman does talk too much. Come, where is this venison? Count, I am waiting for you. How can you see anything in a girl with coarse hands? (_He passes with PETER and his aide-de-camp into an inner room._)  VERA (_to one of the Nihilists_). Won't you sit down? you must be tired.  SERGEANT. Come now, young woman, no talking to my prisoners.  VERA. I shall speak to them. How much do you want?  SERGEANT. How much have you?  VERA. Will you let these men sit down if I give you this? (_Takes off her peasant's necklace._) It is all I have; it was my mother's.  SERGEANT. Well, it looks pretty enough, and is heavy too. What do you want with these men?  VERA. They are hungry and tired. Let me go to them?  ONE OF THE SOLDIERS. Let the wench be, if she pays us.  SERGEANT. Well, have your way. If the Colonel sees you, you may have to come with us, my pretty one.  VERA (_advances to the Nihilists_). Sit down; you must be tired. (_Serves them food._) What are you?  A PRISONER. Nihilists.  VERA. Who put you in chains?  PRISONER. Our Father the Czar.  VERA. Why?  PRISONER. For loving liberty too well.  VERA (_to prisoner who hides his face_). What did you want to do?  DMITRI. To give liberty to thirty millions of people enslaved to one man.  VERA (_startled at the voice_). What is your name?  DMITRI. I have no name.  VERA. Where are your friends?  DMITRI. I have no friends.  VERA. Let me see your face!  DMITRI. You will see nothing but suffering in it. They have tortured me.  VERA (_tears the cloak from his face_). Oh, God! Dmitri! my brother!  DMITRI. Hush! Vera; be calm. You must not let my father know; it would kill him. I thought I could free Russia. I heard men talk of Liberty one night in a caf?. I had never heard the word before. It seemed to be a new god they spoke of. I joined them. It was there all the money went. Five months ago they seized us. They found me printing the paper. I am going to the mines for life. I could not write. I thought it would be better to let you think I was dead; for they are bringing me to a living tomb.  VERA (_looking round_). You must escape, Dmitri. I will take your place.  DMITRI. Impossible! You can only revenge us.  VERA. I shall revenge you.  DMITRI. Listen! there is a house in Moscow--  SERGEANT. Prisoners, attention!--the Colonel is coming--young woman, your time is up.  (_Enter COLONEL, AIDE-DE-CAMP and PETER._)  PETER. I hope your Highness is pleased with the venison. I shot it myself.  COLONEL. It had been better had you talked less about it. Sergeant, get ready. (_Gives purse to PETER._) Here, you cheating rascal!  PETER. My fortune is made! long live your Highness. I hope your Highness will come often this way.  COLONEL. By Saint Nicholas, I hope not. It is too cold here for me. (_To VERA._) Young girl, don't ask questions again about what does not concern you. I will not forget your face.  VERA. Nor I yours, or what you are doing.  COLONEL. You peasants are getting too saucy since you ceased to be serfs, and the knout is the best school for you to learn politics in. Sergeant, proceed.  (_The COLONEL turns and goes to top of stage. The prisoners pass out double file; as DMITRI passes VERA he lets a piece of paper fall on the ground; she puts her foot on it and remains immobile._)  PETER (_who has been counting the money the COLONEL gave him_). Long life to your Highness. I will hope to see another batch soon. (_Suddenly catches sight of DMITRI as he is going out of the door, and screams and rushes up._) Dmitri! Dmitri! my God! what brings you here? he is innocent, I tell you. I'll pay for him. Take your money (_flings money on the ground_), take all I have, give me my son. Villains! Villains! where are you bringing him?  COLONEL. To Siberia, old man.  PETER. No, no; take me instead.  COLONEL. He is a Nihilist.  PETER. You lie! you lie! He is innocent. (_The soldiers force him back with their guns and shut the door against him. He beats with his fists against it._) Dmitri! Dmitri! a Nihilist! (_Falls down on floor._)  VERA (_who has remained motionless, picks up paper now from under her feet and reads_). ""99 Rue Tchernavaya, Moscow. To strangle whatever nature is in me; neither to love nor to be loved; neither to pity nor to be pitied; neither to marry nor to be given in marriage, till the end is come."" My brother, I shall keep the oath. (_Kisses the paper._) You shall be revenged!  (_VERA stands immobile, holding paper in her lifted hand. PETER is lying on the floor. MICHAEL, who has just come in, is bending over him._)  SCENE.--_99 Rue Tchernavaya, Moscow. A large garret lit by oil lamps hung from ceiling. Some masked men standing silent and apart from one another. A man in a scarlet mask is writing at a table. Door at back. Man in yellow with drawn sword at it. Knocks heard. Figures in cloaks and masks enter._   _Password._ Per crucem ad lucem.  _Answer._ Per sanguinem ad libertatem.  (_Clock strikes. CONSPIRATORS form a semicircle in the middle of the stage._)  [2]PRESIDENT. What is the word?  FIRST CONSP. Nabat.  PRES. The answer?  SECOND CONSP. Kalit.  PRES. What hour is it?  THIRD CONSP. The hour to suffer.  PRES. What day?  FOURTH CONSP. The day of oppression.  PRES. What year?  FIFTH CONSP. Since the Revolution of France, the ninth year.[2]  PRES. How many are we in number?  SIXTH CONSP. Ten, nine, and three.  PRES. The Galil?an had less to conquer the world; but what is our mission?  SEVENTH CONSP. To give freedom.  PRES. Our creed?  EIGHTH CONSP. To annihilate.  PRES. Our duty?  NINTH CONSP. To obey.  PRES. Brothers, the questions have been answered well. There are none but Nihilists present. Let us see each other's faces. (_The CONSPIRATORS unmask._) Michael, recite the oath.  MICHAEL. To strangle whatever nature is in us; neither to love nor to be loved, neither to pity nor to be pitied, neither to marry nor to be given in marriage, till the end is come; to stab secretly by night; to drop poison in the glass; to set father against son, and husband against wife; without fear, without hope, without future, to suffer, to annihilate, to revenge.  PRES. Are we all agreed?  CONSPIRATORS. We are all agreed. (_They disperse in various directions about the stage._)  PRES. 'Tis after the hour, Michael, and she is not yet here.  MICH. Would that she were! We can do little without her.  ALEXIS. She cannot have been seized, President? but the police are on her track, I know.  MICH. You always seem to know a good deal about the movements of the police in Moscow--too much for an honest conspirator.  PRES. If those dogs have caught her, [3]the red flag of the people will float on a barricade in[3] every street till we find her! It was foolish of her to go to the Grand Duke's ball. I told her so, but she said she wanted to see the Czar and all his cursed brood face to face once.  ALEXIS. Gone to the State ball?  MICH. I have no fear. She is as hard to capture as a she-wolf is, and twice as dangerous; besides, she is well disguised. But is there any news from the Palace to-night, President? What is that bloody[4] despot doing now besides torturing his only son? Have any of you seen him? One hears strange stories about him. They say he loves the people; but a king's son never does that. You cannot breed them like that.  PRES. Since he came back from abroad a year ago his father has kept him in close prison in his palace.  MICH. An excellent training to make him a tyrant in his turn; but is there any news, I say?  PRES. A council is to be held to-morrow, at four o'clock, on some secret business the spies cannot find out.  MICH. A council in a king's palace is sure to be about some bloody work or other. But in what room is this council to be held?  PRES. (_reading from letter_). In the yellow tapestry room called after the Empress Catherine.  MICH. I care not for such long-sounding names. I would know where it is.  PRES. I cannot tell, Michael. I know more about the insides of prisons than of palaces.  MICH. (_speaking suddenly to ALEXIS_). Where is this room, Alexis?  ALEXIS. It is on the first floor, looking out on to the inner courtyard. But why do you ask, Michael?  MICH. Nothing, nothing, boy! I merely take a great interest in the Czar's life and movements, and I knew you could tell me all about the palace. Every poor student of medicine in Moscow knows all about king's houses. It is their duty, is it not?  ALEXIS (_aside_). Can Michael suspect me? There is something strange in his manner to-night. Why doesn't she come? The whole fire of revolution seems fallen into dull ashes when she is not here.  [5]MICH. Have you cured many patients lately, at your hospital, boy?  ALEX. There is one who lies sick to death I would fain cure, but cannot.  MICH. Ay, and who is that?  ALEX. Russia, our mother.  MICH. The curing of Russia is surgeon's business, and must be done by the knife. I like not your method of medicine.[5]  PRES. Professor, we have read the proofs of your last article; it is very good indeed.  MICH. What is it about, Professor?  PROFESSOR. The subject, my good brother, is assassination considered as a method of political reform.  MICH. I think little of pen and ink in revolutions. One dagger will do more than a hundred epigrams. Still, let us read this scholar's last production. Give it to me. I will read it myself.  PROF. Brother, you never mind your stops; let Alexis read it.  MICH. Ay! he is as tripping of speech as if he were some young aristocrat; but for my own part I care not for the stops so that the sense be plain.  ALEX. (_reading_). ""The past has belonged to the tyrant, and he has defiled it; ours is the future, and we shall make it holy."" Ay! let us make the future holy; let there be one revolution at least which is not bred in crime, nurtured in murder!  MICH. They have spoken to us by the sword, and by the sword we shall answer! You are too delicate for us, Alexis. There should be none here but men whose hands are rough with labour or red with blood.  PRES. Peace, Michael, peace! He is the bravest heart among us.  MICH. (_aside_). He will need to be brave to-night.  (_The sound of sleigh bells is heard outside._)  VOICE (_outside_). Per crucem ad lucem.  _Answer of man on guard._ Per sanguinem ad libertatem.  MICH. Who is that?  VERA. God save the people!  PRES. Welcome, Vera, welcome! [6]We have been sick at heart till we saw you; but now methinks the star of freedom has come to wake us from the night.[6]  VERA. [7]It is night, indeed, brother! Night without moon or star![7] Russia is smitten to the heart! The man Ivan whom men call the Czar strikes now at our mother with a dagger deadlier than ever forged by tyranny against a people's life!  MICH. What has the tyrant[8] done now?  VERA. To-morrow martial law is to be proclaimed in Russia.  OMNES. Martial law! We are lost! We are lost!  ALEX. Martial law! Impossible!  MICH. Fool, nothing is impossible in Russia but reform.  VERA. Ay, martial law. The last right to which the people clung has been taken from them. Without trial, without appeal, without accuser even, our brothers will be taken from their houses, shot in the streets like dogs, sent away to die in the snow, to starve in the dungeon, to rot in the mine. Do you know what martial law means? It means the strangling of a whole nation. [9]The streets will be filled with soldiers night and day; there will be sentinels at every door.[9] No man dare walk abroad now but the spy or the traitor. Cooped up in the dens we hide in, meeting by stealth, speaking with bated breath; what good can we do now for Russia?  PRES. We can suffer at least.  VERA. We have done that too much already. The hour is now come to annihilate and to revenge.  PRES. Up to this the people have borne everything.  VERA. Because they have understood nothing. But now we, the Nihilists, have given them the tree of knowledge to eat of and the day of silent suffering is over for Russia.  MICH. Martial law, Vera! This is fearful tidings you bring.  PRES. It is the death warrant of liberty in Russia.  VERA. Or the tocsin of[10] revolution.  MICH. Are you sure it is true?  VERA. Here is the proclamation. I stole it myself at the ball to-night from a young fool, one of Prince Paul's secretaries, who had been given it to copy. It was that which made me so late.  (_VERA hands proclamation to MICHAEL, who reads it._)  MICH. ""To ensure the public safety--martial law. By order of the Czar, father of his people."" The father of his people!  VERA. Ay! a father whose name shall not be hallowed, whose kingdom shall change to a republic, whose trespasses shall not be forgiven him, because he has robbed us of our daily bread; with whom is neither might, nor right, nor glory, now or for ever.  PRES. It must be about this that the council meet to-morrow. It has not yet been signed.  ALEX. It shall not be while I have a tongue to plead with.  MICH. Or while I have hands to smite with.  VERA. Martial law! O God, how easy it is for a king to kill his people by thousands, but we cannot rid ourselves of one crowned man in Europe! What is there of awful majesty in these men which makes the hand unsteady, the dagger treacherous, the pistol-shot harmless? Are they not men of like passions with ourselves, vulnerable to the same diseases, of flesh and blood not different from our own? What made Olgiati tremble at the supreme crisis of that Roman life, [11]and Guido's nerve fail him when he should have been of iron and of steel? A plague, I say, on these fools of Naples, Berlin, and Spain![11] Methinks that if I stood face to face with one of the crowned men my eye would see more clearly, my aim be more sure, my whole body gain a strength and power that was not my own! Oh, to think what stands between us and freedom in Europe! a few old men, wrinkled, feeble, tottering dotards whom a boy could strangle for a ducat, or a woman stab in a night-time. And these are the things that keep us from democracy, that keep us from liberty. But now methinks the brood of men is dead and the dull earth grown sick of child-bearing, else would no crowned dog pollute God's air by living.  OMNES. Try us! Try us! Try us!  MICH. We shall try thee, too, some day, Vera.  VERA. I pray God thou mayest! Have I not strangled whatever nature is in me, and shall I not keep my oath?  MICH. (_to PRESIDENT_). Martial law, President! Come, there is no time to be lost. We have twelve hours yet before us till the council meet. [12]Twelve hours! One can overthrow a dynasty in less time than that.[12]  PRES. [13]Ay! or lose one's own head.[13]  (_MICHAEL and the PRESIDENT retire to one corner of the stage and sit whispering. VERA takes up the proclamation, and reads it to herself; ALEXIS watches and suddenly rushes up to her._)  ALEX. Vera!  VERA. Alexis, you here! Foolish boy, have I not prayed you to stay away? All of us here are doomed to die before our time, fated to expiate by suffering whatever good we do; but you, with your [14]bright boyish face,[14] you are too young to die yet.  ALEX. One is never too young to die for one's country!  VERA. Why do you come here night after night?  ALEX. Because I love the people.  VERA. But your fellow-students must miss you. Are there no traitors among them? You know what spies there are in the University here. O Alexis, you must go! You see how desperate suffering has made us. There is no room here for a nature like yours. You must not come again.  ALEX. Why do you think so poorly of me? Why should I live while my brothers suffer?  VERA. You spake to me of your mother once. You said you loved her. Oh, think of her!  ALEX. I have no mother now but Russia, my life is hers to take or give away; but to-night I am here to see you. They tell me you are leaving for Novgorod to-morrow.  VERA. I must. They are getting faint-hearted there, and I would fan the flame of this revolution into such a blaze that the eyes of all kings in Europe shall be blinded. If martial law is passed they will need me all the more there. There is no limit, it seems, to the tyranny of one man; but there shall be a limit to the suffering of a whole people.  ALEX. God knows it, I am with you. But you must not go. [15]The police are watching every train for you.[15] When you are seized they have orders to place you without trial in the lowest dungeon of the palace.[16] I know it--no matter how. [17]Oh, think how without you the sun goes from our life, how the people will lose their leader and liberty her priestess.[17] Vera, you must not go!  VERA. If you wish it, I will stay. I would live a little longer for freedom, a little longer for Russia.  ALEX. When you die then Russia is smitten indeed; when you die then I shall lose all hope--all.... Vera, this is fearful news you bring--martial law--it is too terrible. I knew it not, by my soul, I knew it not!  VERA. How could you have known it? It is too well laid a plot for that. This great White Czar, whose hands are red with the blood of the people he has murdered, whose soul is black with his iniquity, is the cleverest conspirator of us all. Oh, how could Russia bear two hearts like yours and his!  ALEX. Vera, the Emperor was not always like this. There was a time when he loved the people. It is that devil, whom God curse, Prince Paul Maraloffski who has brought him to this. To-morrow, I swear it, I shall plead for the people to the Emperor.  VERA. Plead to the Czar! Foolish boy, it is only those who are sentenced to death that ever see our Czar. Besides, what should he care for a voice that pleads for mercy? The cry of a strong nation in its agony has not moved that heart of stone.  ALEX. (_aside_). Yet shall I plead to him. They can but kill me.  PROF. Here are the proclamations, Vera. Do you think they will do?  VERA. I shall read them. [18]How fair he looks?[18] Methinks he never seemed so noble as to-night. Liberty is blessed in having such a lover.  ALEX. Well, President, what are you deep in?  MICH. We are thinking of the best way of killing bears. (_Whispers to PRESIDENT and leads him aside._)  PROF. (_to VERA_). And the letters [19]from our brothers at Paris and Berlin. What answer shall we send to them?[19]  VERA (_takes them mechanically_). Had I not strangled nature, sworn neither to love nor be loved, methinks[20] I might have loved him. Oh, I am a fool, a traitor myself, a traitor myself! But why did he come amongst us with his bright[21] young face, his heart aflame for liberty, his pure white soul? Why does he make me feel at times as if I would have him as my king, Republican though I be? Oh, fool, fool, fool! False to your oath! weak as water! Have done! Remember what you are--a Nihilist, a Nihilist!  PRES. (_to MICHAEL_). But you will be seized, Michael.  MICH. I think not. I will wear the uniform of the Imperial Guard, and the Colonel on duty is one of us. It is on the first floor, you remember; so I can take a long shot.  PRES. Shall I tell the brethren?  [22]MICH. Not a word, not a word! There is a traitor amongst us.  VERA. Come, are these the proclamations? Yes, they will do; yes, they will do. Send five hundred to Kiev and Odessa and Novgorod, five hundred to Warsaw, and have twice the number distributed among the Southern Provinces, though these dull Russian peasants care little for our proclamations, and less for our martyrdoms. When the blow is struck, it must be from the town, not from the country.  MICH. Ay, and by the sword not by the goose-quill.  VERA. Where are the letters from Poland?  PROF. Here.  VERA. Unhappy Poland! The eagles of Russia have fed on her heart. We must not forget our brothers there.[22]  PRES. Is this true, Michael?  MICH. Ay, I stake my life on it.  PRES. [23]Let the doors be locked, then.[23] Alexis Ivanacievitch entered on our roll of the brothers as a Student of the School of Medicine at Moscow. Why did you not tell us of this bloody scheme[24] of martial law?  ALEX. I, President?  MICH. Ay, you! You knew it, none better. Such weapons as these are not forged in a day. Why did you not tell us of it? A week ago there had been time [25]to lay the mine, to raise the barricade, to strike one blow at least for liberty.[25] But now the hour is past. It is too late, [26]it is too late![26] Why did you keep it a secret from us, I say?  ALEX. Now by the hand of freedom, Michael, my brother, you wrong me. I knew nothing of this hideous law. By my soul, my brothers, I knew not of it! How should I know?  MICH. Because you are a traitor! Where did you go when you left us the night of our last meeting here?  [27]ALEX. To mine own house, Michael.[27]  MICH. Liar! I was on your track. You left here an hour after midnight. Wrapped in a large cloak, you crossed the river in a boat a mile below the second bridge, and gave the ferryman a gold piece, you, the poor student of medicine! You doubled back twice, and hid in an archway so long th"|2
89|"at I had almost made up my mind to stab you at once, only that I am fond of hunting. So! you thought that you had baffled all pursuit, did you? Fool! I am a bloodhound that never loses the scent. I followed you from street to street. At last I saw you pass swiftly across the Place St. Isaac, whisper to the guards the secret password, enter the palace by a private door with your own key.  CONSPIRATORS. The palace!  VERA. Alexis!  MICH. I waited. All through the dreary watches of our long Russian night I waited, that I might kill you with your Judas hire still hot in your hand. But you never came out; you never left that palace at all. I saw the blood-red sun rise through the yellow fog over the murky town; I saw a new day of oppression dawn on Russia; but you never came out. So you pass nights in the palace, do you? You know the password for the guards! you have a key to a secret door. Oh, you are a spy--you are a spy! I never trusted you, [28]with your soft white hands, your curled hair, your pretty graces.[28] You have no mark of suffering about you; you cannot be of the people. You are a spy--[29]a spy--traitor.[29]  OMNES. Kill him! Kill him! (_draw their knives_.)  VERA (_rushing in front of ALEXIS_). Stand back, I say, Michael! Stand back all! [30]Do not dare[30] lay a hand upon him! He is the noblest heart amongst us.  OMNES. Kill him! Kill him! He is a spy!  VERA. Dare to lay a finger on him, and I leave you all to yourselves.  PRES. Vera, did you not hear what Michael said of him? He stayed all night in the Czar's palace. He has a password and a private key. What else should he be but a spy?  VERA. Bah! I do not believe Michael. It is a lie! It is[31] a lie! Alexis, say it is a lie!  ALEX. It is true. Michael has told what he saw. I did pass that night in the Czar's palace. Michael has spoken the truth.  VERA. Stand back, I say; stand back! Alexis, I do not care. I trust you; you would not betray us; you would not sell the people for money. You are honest, true! Oh, say you are no spy!  ALEX. Spy? You know I am not. I am with you, my brothers, to the death.  MICH. Ay, to your own death.  ALEX. Vera, you[32] know I am true.  VERA. I know it well.  PRES. Why are you here, traitor?  ALEX. Because I love the people.  MICH. Then you can be a martyr for them?  VERA. You must kill me first, Michael, before you lay a finger on him.  PRES. Michael, we dare not lose Vera. It is her whim to let this boy live. We can keep him here to-night. Up to this he has not betrayed us.  (_Tramp of soldiers outside, knocking at door._)[33]  VOICE. Open in the name of the Emperor!  MICH. He _has_ betrayed us. This is your doing, spy!  PRES. Come, Michael, come. We have no time to cut one another's throats while we have our own heads to save.  VOICE. Open in the name of the Emperor!  PRES. Brothers, be masked all of you. [34]Michael, open the door. It is our only chance.[34]  (_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN and soldiers._)  GEN. All honest citizens should be in their own houses at an hour before midnight, and not more than five people have a right to meet privately. Have you not noticed the proclamation, fellows?  MICH. Ay, you have spoiled every honest[35] wall in Moscow with it.  VERA. Peace, Michael, peace. Nay, Sir, we knew it not. We are a company of strolling players travelling from Samara to Moscow to amuse His Imperial Majesty the Czar.  GEN. But I heard loud voices before I entered. What was that?  VERA. We were rehearsing a new tragedy.  GEN. Your answers are too _honest_ to be true. Come, let me see who you are. Take off those players' masks. By St. Nicholas, my beauty, if your face matches your figure, you must be a choice morsel! Come, I say, pretty one; I would sooner see your face than those of all the others.  PRES. O God! if he sees it is Vera, we are all lost!  GEN. No coquetting, my girl. Come, unmask, I say, or I shall tell my guards to do it for you.  ALEX. Stand back, I say, General Kotemkin!  GEN. Who are you, fellow, that talk with such a tripping tongue to your betters? (_ALEXIS takes his mask off_.) His Imperial Highness the Czarevitch!  OMNES. The Czarevitch! [36]It is all over![36]  [37]PRES. He will give us up to the soldiers.[37]  MICH. (_to VERA_). Why did you not let me kill him? Come, we must fight to the death for it.  VERA. Peace! he will not betray us.  ALEX. A whim of mine, General! You know how my father keeps me from the world and imprisons me in the palace. I should really be bored to death if I could not get out at night in disguise sometimes, and have some romantic adventure in town. I fell in with these honest folks a few hours ago.  GEN. But, your Highness--  ALEX. Oh, they are excellent actors, I assure you. If you had come in ten minutes ago, you would have witnessed a most interesting scene.  GEN. Actors, are they, Prince?  ALEX. Ay, and very ambitious actors, too. They only care to play before kings.  GEN. I' faith, your Highness, I was in hopes I had made a good haul of Nihilists.[38]  ALEX. Nihilists in Moscow, General! with you as head of the police? Impossible!  GEN. So I always tell your Imperial father. But I heard at the council to-day that that woman Vera Sabouroff, the head of them, had been seen in this very city. The Emperor's face turned as white as the snow outside. I think I never saw such terror in any man before.  ALEX. She is a dangerous woman, then, this Vera Sabouroff?  GEN. The most dangerous in all Europe.  ALEX. Did you ever see her, General?  GEN. Why, five years ago, when I was a plain Colonel, I remember her, your Highness, a common waiting girl in an inn. If I had known then what she was going to turn out, I would have flogged her to death on the roadside. She is not a woman at all; she is a sort of devil! For the last eighteen months I have been hunting her, and caught sight of her once last September outside Odessa.  ALEX. How did you let her go, General?  GEN. I was by myself, and she shot one of my horses just as I was gaining on her. If I see her again I shan't miss my chance. The Emperor has put twenty thousand roubles on her head.  ALEX. I hope you will get it, General; but meanwhile you are frightening these honest people out of their wits, and disturbing the tragedy. Good night, General.  GEN. Yes; but I should like to see their faces, your Highness.  ALEX. No, General; you must not ask that; you know how these gipsies hate to be stared at.  GEN. Yes. But, your Highness--  ALEX. (_haughtily_). General, they are my friends, that is enough. And, General, not a word of this little adventure here, you understand. I shall rely on you.  GEN. I shall not forget, Prince. But shall we not see you back to the palace? The State ball is almost over and you are expected.  ALEX. I shall be there; but I shall return alone. Remember, not a word about my strolling players.  GEN. Or your pretty gipsy, eh, Prince? your pretty gipsy! I' faith, I should like to see her before I go; she has such fine eyes through her mask. Well, good night, your Highness; good night.  ALEX. Good night, General.  (_Exit GENERAL and the soldiers._)  VERA (_throwing off her mask_). Saved! and by you!  ALEX. (_clasping her hand_). Brothers, you trust me now?  SCENE.--_Council Chamber in the Emperor's Palace, hung with yellow tapestry. Table, with chair of State, set for the Czar; window behind, opening on to a balcony. As the scene progresses the light outside gets darker._  _Present._--PRINCE PAUL MARALOFFSKI, PRINCE PETROVITCH, COUNT ROUVALOFF, BARON RAFF, COUNT PETOUCHOF.   PRINCE PETRO. So our young scatter-brained Czarevitch has been forgiven at last, and is to take his seat here again.  PRINCE PAUL. Yes; if that is not meant as an extra punishment. For my own part, at least, I find these Cabinet Councils extremely exhausting.  PRINCE PETRO. Naturally; you are always speaking.  PRINCE PAUL. No; I think it must be that I have to listen sometimes.  COUNT R. Still, anything is better than being kept in a sort of prison, like he was--never allowed to go out into the world.  PRINCE PAUL. My dear Count, for romantic young people like he is, the world always looks best at a distance; and a prison where one's allowed to order one's own dinner is not at all a bad place. (_Enter the CZAREVITCH. The courtiers rise._) Ah! good afternoon, Prince. Your Highness is looking a little pale to-day.  CZARE. (_slowly, after a pause_). I want change of air.  PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). A most revolutionary sentiment! Your Imperial father would highly disapprove of any reforms with the thermometer in Russia.  CZARE. (_bitterly_). My Imperial father had kept me for six months in this dungeon of a palace. This morning he has me suddenly woke up to see some wretched Nihilists hung; it sickened me, the bloody butchery, though it was a noble thing to see how well these men can die.  PRINCE PAUL. When you are as old as I am, Prince, you will understand that there are few things easier than to live badly and to die well.  CZARE. Easy to die well! A lesson experience cannot have taught you, whatever you may know of a bad life.  PRINCE PAUL (_shrugging his shoulders_). Experience, the name men give to their mistakes. I never commit any.  CZARE. (_bitterly_). No; crimes are more in your line.  PRINCE PETRO. (_to the CZAREVITCH_). The Emperor was a good deal agitated about your late appearance at the ball last night, Prince.  [1]COUNT R. (_laughing_). I believe he thought the Nihilists had broken into the palace and carried you off.  BARON RAFF. If they had you would have missed a charming dance.[1]  PRINCE PAUL. And[2] an excellent supper. Gringoire really excelled himself in his salad. Ah! you may laugh, Baron; but to make a good salad is a much more difficult thing than cooking accounts. To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist--the problem is so entirely the same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's vinegar.  BARON RAFF. A cook and a diplomatist! an excellent parallel. If I had a son who was a fool I'd make him one or the other.  PRINCE PAUL. I see your father did not hold the same opinion, Baron. But, believe me, you are wrong to run down cookery. For myself, the only immortality I desire is to invent a new sauce. I have never had time enough to think seriously about it, but I feel it is in me, I feel it is in me.  CZARE. You have certainly missed your _metier_,[3] Prince Paul; the _cordon bleu_ would have suited you much better than the Grand Cross of Honour. But you know you could never have worn your white apron well; you would have soiled it too soon, your hands are not clean enough.  PRINCE PAUL (_bowing_). Que voulez vous? I manage your father's business.  CZARE. (_bitterly_). You mismanage my father's business, you mean! Evil genius of his life that you are! before you came there was some love left in him. It is you who have embittered his nature, poured into his ear the poison of treacherous counsel, made him hated by the whole people, made him what he is--a tyrant!  (_The courtiers look significantly at each other._)  PRINCE PAUL (_calmly_). I see your Highness does want change of air. But I have been an eldest son myself. (_Lights a cigarette._) I know what it is when a father won't die to please one.  (_The CZAREVITCH goes to the top of the stage, and leans against the window, looking out._)  PRINCE PETRO. (_to BARON RAFF_). Foolish boy! [4]He will be sent into exile, or worse, if he is not careful.[4]  BARON RAFF. Yes.[5] What a mistake it is to be sincere!  PRINCE PETRO. The only folly you have never committed, Baron.  BARON RAFF. One has only one head, you know, Prince.  PRINCE PAUL. My dear Baron, your head is the last thing any one would wish to take from you. (_Pulls out snuffbox and offers it to PRINCE PETROVITCH._)  PRINCE PETRO. Thanks, Prince! Thanks!  PRINCE PAUL. Very delicate, isn't it? I get it direct from Paris. But under this vulgar Republic everything has degenerated over there. ""Cotelettes ? l'imp?riale"" vanished, of course, with the Bourbon, and omelettes went out with the Orleanists. La belle France is entirely ruined, Prince, through bad morals and worse cookery. (_Enter the MARQUIS DE POIVRARD._) Ah! Marquis. I trust Madame la Marquise is well.  MARQUIS DE P. You ought to know better than I do, Prince Paul; you see more _of_ her.  PRINCE PAUL (_bowing_). Perhaps I see more _in_ her, Marquis. Your wife is really a charming woman, so full of _esprit_, and so satirical too; she talks continually of you when we are together.  PRINCE PETRO. (_looking at the clock_). His Majesty is a little late to-day, is he not?  PRINCE PAUL. What has happened to you, my dear Petrovitch? you seem quite out of sorts. You haven't quarrelled with your cook, I hope? What a tragedy that would be for you; you would lose all your friends.  PRINCE PETRO. I fear I wouldn't be so fortunate as that. You forget I would still have my purse.[6] But you are wrong for once; my chef and I are on excellent[7] terms.  PRINCE PAUL. Then your creditors or Mademoiselle Vera Sabouroff have been writing to you? I find both of them such excellent correspondents. But really you needn't be alarmed. I find the most violent proclamations from the Executive Committee, as they call it, left all over my house. I never read them; they are so badly spelt as a rule.  PRINCE PETRO. Wrong again, Prince; the Nihilists leave me alone for some reason or other.  PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). Ah! true. I forgot. Indifference is the revenge the world takes on mediocrities.  PRINCE PETRO. I am bored with life,[8] Prince. Since the opera season ended I have been a perpetual martyr to ennui.  PRINCE PAUL. The maladie du si?cle! You want a new excitement, Prince. Let me see--you have been married twice already; suppose you try--falling in love, for once.  BARON R. Prince, I have been thinking a good deal lately--  PRINCE PAUL (_interrupting_). You surprise me very much, Baron.  BARON R. I cannot understand your nature.  PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). If my nature had been made to suit your comprehension rather than my own requirements, I am afraid I would have made a very poor figure in the world.  COUNT R. There seems to be nothing in life about which you would not jest.  PRINCE PAUL. Ah! my dear Count, life is much too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.  CZARE. (_coming back from the window_). I don't think Prince Paul's nature is such a mystery. He would stab his best friend for the sake of writing an epigram on his tombstone, or experiencing a new sensation.  PRINCE PAUL. Parbleu! I would sooner lose my best friend than my worst enemy. To have friends, you know, one need only be good-natured; but when a man has no enemy left there must be something mean about him.  CZARE. (_bitterly_). If to have enemies is a measure of greatness, then you must be a Colossus, indeed, Prince.  PRINCE PAUL. Yes, I know I'm the most hated man in Russia, except your father, [9]except your father, of course,[9] Prince. He doesn't seem to like it much, by the way, but I do, I assure you. (_Bitterly._) I love to drive through the streets and see how the canaille scowl at me from every corner. It makes me feel I am a power in Russia; one man against a hundred millions! Besides, I have no ambition to be a popular hero, to be crowned with laurels one year and pelted with stones the next; I prefer dying peaceably in my own bed.  CZARE. And after death?  PRINCE PAUL (_shrugging his shoulders_). Heaven is a despotism. I shall be at home there.  CZARE. Do you never think of the people and their rights?  PRINCE PAUL. The people and their rights bore me. I am sick of both. In these modern days to be vulgar, illiterate, common and vicious, seems to give a man a marvellous infinity of rights that his honest fathers never dreamed of. Believe me, Prince, in good democracy every man should be an aristocrat; but these people in Russia who seek to thrust us out are no better than the animals in one's preserves, and made to be shot at, most of them.  CZARE. (_excitedly_). If they are[10] common, illiterate, vulgar, no better than the beasts of the field, who made them so?  (_Enter AIDE-DE-CAMP._)  AIDE-DE-CAMP. His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor! (_PRINCE PAUL looks at the CZAREVITCH, and smiles._)  (_Enter the CZAR, surrounded by his guard._)  CZARE. (_rushing forward to meet him_). Sire!  CZAR (_nervous and frightened_). Don't come too near me, boy! Don't come too near me, I say! There is always something about an heir to a crown unwholesome to his father. Who is that man over there? I don't know him. What is he doing? Is he a conspirator? Have you searched him? Give him till to-morrow to confess, then hang him!--hang him!  PRINCE PAUL. Sire, you are anticipating history. This is Count Petouchof, your new ambassador to Berlin. He is come to kiss hands on his appointment.  CZAR. To kiss my hand? There is some plot in it. He wants to poison me. There, kiss my son's hand; it will do quite as well.  (_PRINCE PAUL signs to COUNT PETOUCHOF to leave the room. Exit PETOUCHOF and the guards. CZAR sinks down into his chair. The courtiers remain silent._)  PRINCE PAUL (_approaching_). Sire! will your Majesty--  CZAR. What do you startle me like that for? No, I won't. (_Watches the courtiers nervously._) Why are you clattering your sword, sir? (_To COUNT ROUVALOFF._) Take it off, I shall have no man wear a sword in my presence (_looking at CZAREVITCH_), least of all my son. (_To PRINCE PAUL._) You are not angry with me, Prince? You won't desert me, will you? Say you won't desert me. What do you want? You can have anything--anything.  PRINCE PAUL (_bowing very low_). Sire, 'tis enough for me to have your confidence. (_Aside._) I was afraid he was going to revenge himself and give me another decoration.  CZAR (_returning to his chair_). Well, gentlemen.  MARQ. DE POIV. Sire, I have the honour to present to you a loyal address from your subjects in the Province of Archangel, expressing their horror at the last attempt on your Majesty's life.  PRINCE PAUL. The last attempt but two, you ought to have said, Marquis. Don't you see it is dated three weeks back?  CZAR. They are good people in the Province of Archangel--honest, loyal people. They love me very much--simple, loyal people; give them a new saint, it costs nothing. Well, Alexis (_turning to the CZAREVITCH_)--how many traitors were hung this morning?  CZARE. There were three men strangled, Sire.  CZAR. There should have been three[11] thousand. I would to God that this people had but one neck that I might strangle them with one noose! Did they tell anything? whom did they implicate? what did they confess?  CZARE. Nothing, Sire.  CZAR. They should have been tortured then; why weren't they tortured? Must I always be fighting in the dark? Am I never to know from what root these traitors spring?  CZARE. What root should there be of discontent among the people but tyranny and injustice amongst their rulers?  CZAR. What did you say, boy? tyranny! tyranny! Am I a tyrant? I'm not. I love the people. I'm their father. I'm called so in every official proclamation. Have a care, boy; have a care. You don't seem to be cured yet of your foolish tongue. (_Goes over to PRINCE PAUL, and puts his hand on his shoulder._) Prince Paul, tell me were there many people there this morning to see the Nihilists hung?  PRINCE PAUL. Hanging is of course a good deal less of a novelty in Russia now, Sire, than it was three or four years ago; and you know how easily the people get tired even of their best amusements. But the square and the tops of the houses were really quite crowded, were they not, Prince? (_To the CZAREVITCH who takes no notice._)  CZAR. That's right; all loyal citizens should be there. It shows them what to look forward to. Did you arrest any one in the crowd?  PRINCE PAUL. Yes, Sire, a woman for cursing your name. (_The CZAREVITCH starts anxiously._) She was the mother of the two criminals.  CZAR (_looking at CZAREVITCH_). She should have blessed me for having rid her of her children. Send her to prison.  CZARE. The prisons of Russia are too full already, Sire. There is no room in them for any more victims.  [12]CZAR. They don't die fast enough, then. You should put more of them into one cell at once. You don't keep them long enough in the mines. If you do they're sure to die; but you're all too merciful. I'm too merciful myself. Send her to Siberia.[12] She is sure to die on the way. (_Enter an AIDE-DE-CAMP._) Who's that? Who's that?  AIDE-DE-CAMP. A letter for his Imperial Majesty.  CZAR (_to PRINCE PAUL_). I won't open it. There may be something in it.  PRINCE PAUL. It would be a very disappointing letter, Sire, if there wasn't. (_Takes letter himself, and reads it._)  PRINCE PETRO. (_to COUNT ROUVALOFF_). It must be some sad news. I know that smile too well.  PRINCE PAUL. From the Chief of the Police at Archangel, Sire. ""The Governor of the province was shot this morning by a woman as he was entering the courtyard of his own house. The assassin has been seized.""  CZAR. I never trusted the people of Archangel. It's a nest of Nihilists and conspirators. Take away their saints; they don't deserve them.  PRINCE PAUL. Your Highness would punish them more severely by giving them an extra one. Three governors shot in two months. (_Smiles to himself._) Sire, permit me to recommend your loyal subject, the Marquis de Poivrard, as the new governor of your Province of Archangel.  MARQ. DE POIV. (_hurriedly_). Sire, I am unfit for this post.  PRINCE PAUL. Marquis, you are too modest. Believe me, there is no man in Russia I would sooner see Governor of Archangel than yourself. (_Whispers to CZAR._)  CZAR. Quite right, Prince Paul; you are always right. See that the Marquis's letters are made out at once.  PRINCE PAUL. He can start to-night, Sire. I shall really miss you very much, Marquis. I always liked your taste in wines and wives extremely.  MARQ. DE POIV. (_to the CZAR_). Start to-night, Sire? (_PRINCE PAUL whispers to the CZAR._)  CZAR. Yes, Marquis, to-night; it is better to go at once.  PRINCE PAUL. I shall see that Madame la Marquise is not too lonely while you are away; so you need not be alarmed for her.  COUNT R. (_to PRINCE PETROVITCH_). I should be more alarmed for myself.  CZAR. The Governor of Archangel shot in his own courtyard by a woman! I'm not safe here. I'm not safe anywhere, with that she devil of the revolution, Vera Sabouroff, here in Moscow. Prince Paul, is that woman still here?  PRINCE PAUL. They tell me she was at the Grand Duke's ball last night. I can hardly believe that; but she certainly had intended to leave for Novgorod to-day, Sire. The police were watching every train for her; but, for some reason or other, she did not go. Some traitor must have warned her. But I shall catch her yet. A chase after a beautiful woman is always exciting.  CZAR. You must hunt her down with bloodhounds, and when she is taken I shall hew her limb from limb. I shall stretch her on the rack till her pale white body is twisted and curled like paper in the fire.  PRINCE PAUL. Oh, we shall have another hunt immediately for her, Sire! Prince Alexis will assist us, I am sure.  CZARE. You never require any assistance to ruin a woman, Prince Paul.  CZAR. Vera, the Nihilist, in Moscow! O God,[13] were it not better to die at once the dog's death they plot for me than to live as I live now! Never to sleep, or, if I do, to dream such horrid dreams that Hell itself were peace when matched with them. To trust none but those I have bought, to buy none worth trusting! To see a traitor in every smile, poison in every dish, a dagger in every hand! To lie awake at night, listening from hour to hour for the stealthy creeping of the murderer, for the laying of the damned mine! You are all spies! you are all spies! You worst of all--you, my own son! Which of you is it who hides these bloody proclamations under my own pillow, or at the table where I sit? Which of ye all is the Judas who betrays me? O God! O God! methinks there was a time once, in our war with England, when nothing could make me afraid. (_This with more calm and pathos._) I have ridden into the crimson heart of war, and borne back an eagle which those wild islanders had taken from us. Men said I was brave then. My father gave me the Iron Cross of valour. Oh, could he see me now with this coward's livery ever in my cheek! (_Sinks into his chair._) I never knew any love when I was a boy. I was ruled by terror myself, how else should I rule now? (_Starts up._) But I will have revenge; I will have revenge. For every hour I have lain awake at night, waiting for the noose or the dagger, they shall pass years in Siberia, centuries in the mines! Ay! I shall have revenge.  CZARE. Father! have mercy on the people. Give them what they ask.  PRINCE PAUL. And begin, Sire, with your own head; they have a particular liking for that.  CZAR. The people! the people! A tiger which I have let loose upon myself; but I will fight with it to the death. [14]I am done with half measures.[14] I shall crush these Nihilists at a blow. There shall not be a man of them, ay, or a woman either, left alive in Russia. [15]Am I Emperor for[15] nothing, that a woman should hold me at bay? Vera Sabouroff shall be in my power, I swear it, before a week is ended, [16]though I burn my whole city to find her.[16] She shall be flogged by the knout, stifled in the fortress, strangled in the square!  CZARE. O God!  CZAR. For two years her hands have been clutching at my throat; for two years she has made my life a hell; but I shall have revenge. Martial law, Prince, martial law over the whole Empire; that will give me revenge. A good measure, Prince, eh? a good measure.  PRINCE PAUL. And an economical one too, Sire. It would carry off your surplus population in six months, and save you many expenses in courts of justice; they will not be needed now.  CZAR. Quite right. There are too many people in Russia, too much money spent on them, too much money in courts of justice. I'll shut them up.  CZARE. Sire, reflect before--  CZAR. When can you have the proclamations ready, Prince Paul?  PRINCE PAUL. They have been printed for the last six months, Sire. I knew you would need them.  CZAR. That's good! That's very good! Let us begin at once. Ah, Prince, if every king in Europe had a minister like you--  CZARE. There would be less kings in Europe than there are.  CZAR (_in frightened whisper, to PRINCE PAUL_). What does he mean? Do you trust him? His prison hasn't cured him yet. Shall I banish him? Shall I (_whispers_)...? The Emperor Paul did it. The Empress Catherine there[17] (_points to picture on the wall_) did it. Why shouldn't I?  PRINCE PAUL. Your Majesty, there is no need for alarm. The Prince is a very ingenuous young man. He pretends to be devoted to the people, and lives in a palace; preaches socialism, and draws a salary that would support a province. He'll find out one day that the best cure for Republicanism is the Imperial crown, and will cut up the ""bonnet rogue"" of Democracy to make decorations for his Prime Minister.  CZAR. You are right. If he really loved the people, he could not be my son.  PRINCE PAUL. If he lived with the people for a fortnight, their bad dinners would soon cure him of his democracy. Shall we begin, Sire?  CZAR. At once. Read the proclamation. Gentlemen, be seated. Alexis, Alexis, I say, come and hear it! It will be good practice for you; you will be doing it yourself some day.  CZARE. I have heard too much of it already. (_Takes his seat at the table. COUNT ROUVALOFF whispers to him._)  CZAR. What are you whispering about there, Count Rouvaloff?  COUNT R. I was giving his Royal Highness some good advice, your Majesty.  PRINCE PAUL. Count Rouvaloff is the typical spendthrift, Sire; he is always giving away what he needs most. (_Lays papers before the CZAR._) I think, Sire, you will approve of this:--""Love of the people,"" ""Father of his people,"" ""Martial law,"" and the usual allusions to Providence in the last line. All it requires now is your Imperial Majesty's signature.  CZARE. Sire!  PRINCE PAUL (_hurriedly_). I promise your Majesty to crush every Nihilist in Russia in six months if you sign this proclamation; every Nihilist in Russia.  CZAR. Say that again! To crush every Nihilist in Russia; to crush this woman, their leader, who makes war upon me in my own city. Prince Paul Maraloffski, I create you Marechale of the whole Russian Empire to help you to carry out martial law."|2
90|"  CZAR. Give me the proclamation. I will sign it at once.  PRINCE PAUL (_points on paper_). Here, Sire.  CZARE. (_starts up and puts his hands on the paper_). Stay! I tell you, stay! The priests have taken heaven from the people, and you would take the earth away too.  PRINCE PAUL. We have no time, Prince, now. This boy will ruin everything. The pen, Sire.  CZARE. What! is it so small a thing to strangle a nation, to murder a kingdom, to wreck an empire? Who are we who dare lay this ban of terror on a people? Have we less vices than they have, that we bring them to the bar of judgment before us?  PRINCE PAUL. What a Communist the Prince is! He would have an equal distribution of sin as well as of property.  CZARE. Warmed by the same sun, nurtured by the same air, fashioned of flesh and blood like to our own, wherein are they different to us, save that they starve while we surfeit, that they toil while we idle, that they sicken while we poison, that they die while we strangle?  CZAR. How dare--?  CZARE. I dare all for the people; but you would rob them of common rights of common men.  CZAR. The people have no rights.  CZARE. Then they have great wrongs. Father, they have won your battles for you; from the pine forests of the Baltic to the palms of India they have ridden on victory's mighty wings in search of your glory! Boy as I am in years, I have seen wave after wave of living men sweep up the heights of battle to their death; ay, and snatch perilous conquest from the scales of war when the bloody crescent seemed to shake above our eagles.  CZAR (_somewhat moved_). Those men are dead. What have I to do with them?  CZARE. Nothing! The dead are safe; you[18] cannot harm them now. They sleep their last long sleep. Some in Turkish waters, others by the windswept heights of Norway and the Dane! But these, the living, our brothers, what have you done for them? They asked you for bread, you gave them a stone. They sought for freedom, you scourged them with scorpions. You have sown the seeds of this revolution yourself!--  PRINCE PAUL. And are we not cutting down the harvest?  CZARE. Oh, my brothers! better far that ye had died in the iron hail and screaming shell of battle than to come back to such a doom as[19] this! The beasts of the forests have their lairs, and the wild beasts their caverns, but the people of Russia, conquerors of the world, have not where to lay their heads.  PRINCE PAUL. They have the headsman's block.  CZARE. The headsman's block! Ay! you have killed their souls at your pleasure, you would kill their bodies now.  CZAR. Insolent boy! Have you forgotten who is Emperor of Russia?  CZARE. No! The people reign now, by the grace of God.[20] You should have been their shepherd; you have fled away like the hireling, and let the wolves in upon them.  CZAR. Take him away! Take him away, Prince Paul!  CZARE. God hath given this people tongues to speak with; you would cut them out that they may be dumb in their agony, silent in their torture! But God hath given them hands to smite with, and they shall smite! Ay! from the sick and labouring womb of this unhappy land some revolution, like a bloody child, shall[21] rise up and slay you.  CZAR (_leaping up_). Devil! Assassin! Why do you beard me thus to my face?  CZARE. Because I[22] am a Nihilist! (_The ministers start to their feet; there is dead silence for a few minutes._)  CZAR. A Nihilist! a Nihilist! Scorpion whom I have nurtured, traitor whom I have fondled, is this your bloody secret? Prince Paul Maraloffski, Marechale of the Russian Empire, arrest the Czarevitch!  MINISTERS. Arrest the Czarevitch!  CZAR. A Nihilist! If you have sown with them, you shall reap with them! If you have talked with them, you shall rot with them! If you have lived with them, with them you shall die!  PRINCE PETRO. Die!  CZAR. A plague on all sons, I say! There should be no more marriages in Russia when one can breed such vipers as you are! Arrest the Czarevitch, I say!  PRINCE PAUL. Czarevitch! by order of the Emperor, I demand your sword. (_CZAREVITCH gives up sword; PRINCE PAUL places it on the table._) Foolish boy! you are not made for a conspirator; you have not learned to hold your tongue. Heroics are out of place in a palace.  CZAR (_sinks into his chair with his eyes fixed on the CZAREVITCH_). O God!  CZARE. If I am to die for the people, I am ready; one Nihilist more or less in Russia, what does that matter?  PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). A good deal I should say to the one Nihilist.  [23]CZARE. The mighty brotherhood to which I belong has a thousand such as I am, ten thousand better still! (_The CZAR starts in his seat._) The star of freedom is risen already, and far off I hear the mighty wave democracy break on these cursed shores.[23]  PRINCE PAUL (_to PRINCE PETROVITCH_). In that case you and I had better learn how to swim.  CZARE. Father, Emperor, Imperial Master, I plead not for my own life, but for the lives of my brothers, the people.  PRINCE PAUL (_bitterly_). Your brothers, the people, Prince, are not content with their own lives, they always want to take their neighbour's too.  CZAR (_standing up_). I am sick of being afraid. I have done with terror now. From this day I proclaim war against the people--war to their annihilation. As they have dealt with me, so shall I deal with them. I shall grind them to powder, and strew their dust upon the air. There shall be a spy in every man's house, a traitor on every hearth, a hangman in every village, a gibbet in every square. Plague, leprosy, or fever shall be less deadly than my wrath; I will make every frontier a grave-yard, every province a lazar-house, and cure the sick by the sword. I shall have peace in Russia, though it be the peace of the dead. Who said I was a coward? Who said I was afraid? See, thus shall I crush this people beneath my feet! (_Takes up sword of CZAREVITCH off table and tramples on it._)  CZARE. Father, beware, the sword you tread on may turn and wound you. The people suffer long, but vengeance comes at last, vengeance with red hands and bloody purpose.  PRINCE PAUL. Bah! the people are bad shots; they always miss one.  CZARE. There are times when the people are instruments of God.  CZAR. Ay! and when kings are God's scourges for the people. Oh, my own son, in my own house! My own flesh and blood against me! Take him away! Take him away! Bring in my guards. (_Enter the Imperial Guard. CZAR points to CZAREVITCH, who stands alone at the side of the stage._) To the blackest prison in Moscow! Let me never see his face again. (_CZAREVITCH is being led out._) No, no, leave him! I don't trust guards. They are all Nihilists! They would let him escape and he would kill me, kill me! No, I'll bring him to prison myself, you and I (_to PRINCE PAUL_). I trust you, you have no mercy. I shall have no mercy. Oh, my own son against me! How hot it is! The air stifles me! I feel as if I were going to faint, as if something were at my throat. Open the windows, I say! Out of my sight! Out of my sight! I can't bear his eyes. Wait, wait for me. (_Throws window open and goes out on balcony._)  PRINCE PAUL (_looking at his watch_). The dinner is sure to be spoiled. How annoying politics are and eldest sons!  VOICE (_outside, in the street_). God save the people! (_CZAR is shot, and staggers back into the room._)  CZARE. (_breaking from the guards, and rushing over_). Father!  CZAR. Murderer! Murderer! You did it! Murderer! (_Dies._)   TABLEAU.   END OF ACT II.     ACT III.  _Same scene and business as Act I. Man in yellow dress, with drawn sword, at the door._   _Password outside._ V? tyrannis.  _Answer._ V? victis (_repeated three times_).  (_Enter CONSPIRATORS, who form a semicircle, masked and cloaked._)  PRESIDENT. What hour is it?  FIRST CONSP. The hour to strike.  PRES. What day?  SECOND CONSP. The day of Marat.[1]  PRES. In what month?  SECOND CONSP. The month of liberty.  PRES. What is our duty?  FOURTH CONSP. To obey.  PRES. Our creed?  FIFTH CONSP. Parbleu, Mons. le President, I never knew you had one.  CONSPS. A spy! A spy! Unmask! Unmask! A spy!  PRES. [2]Let the doors be shut. There are others but Nihilists present.[2]  CONSPS. Unmask! Unmask! [3]Kill him! kill him![3] (_Masked CONSPIRATOR unmasks._) Prince Paul!  VERA. Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?  CONSPS. Kill him! kill him![4]  PRINCE PAUL. En v?rit?, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your welcome.  VERA. Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the noose?  PRINCE PAUL. I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_ to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never have been Prime Minister in Russia.  VERA. The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom; but are you turned a lover of the people?  PRINCE PAUL. Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and dine off one dish.  PRES. What have you to gain, then, by a revolution?  PRINCE PAUL. Mon ami, I have nothing left to lose. That scatter-brained boy, this new Czar, has banished me.  VERA. To Siberia?  PRINCE PAUL. No, to Paris. He has confiscated my estates, robbed me of my office and my cook. I have nothing left but my decorations. I am here for revenge.[5]  PRES. Then you have a right to be one of us. [5]We also meet daily for revenge.[5]  PRINCE PAUL. You want money, of course. No one ever joins a conspiracy who has any. Here. (_Throws money on table._) You have so many spies that I should think you want information. Well, you will find me the best informed man in Russia on the abuses of our Government. I made them nearly all myself.  VERA. President, I don't trust this man. He has done us too much harm in Russia to let him go in safety.  PRINCE PAUL. Believe me, Mademoiselle, you are wrong; I will be a most valuable addition to your circle; as for you, gentlemen, if I had not thought that you would be useful to me I shouldn't have risked my neck among you, or dined an hour earlier than usual so as to be in time.  PRES. Ay, if he had wanted to spy on us, Vera, he wouldn't have come himself.  PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). No; I should have sent my best friend.  PRES. Besides, Vera, he is just the man to give us the information we want about some business we have in hand to-night.  VERA. Be it so if you wish it.  PRES. Brothers, is it your will that Prince Paul Maraloffski be admitted, and take the oath of the Nihilist?  CONSPS. It is! it is!  PRES. (_holding out dagger and a paper_). Prince Paul, the dagger or the oath?  PRINCE PAUL (_smiles sardonically_). I would sooner annihilate than be annihilated. (_Takes paper._)  PRES. Remember: [6]Betray us, and as long as the earth holds poison or steel, as long as men can strike or woman betray, you shall not escape vengeance.[6] The Nihilists never forget their friends, or forgive their enemies.  PRINCE PAUL. Really? I did not think you were so civilized.  VERA (_pacing up and down_). Why is he not here? He will not keep the crown. I know him well.  PRES. Sign. (_PRINCE PAUL signs_.) You said you thought we had no creed. You were wrong. Read it!  VERA. This is a dangerous thing, President. What can we do with this man?  PRES. We can use him.  VERA. And afterwards?  PRES. (_shrugging his shoulders_). Strangle him.  PRINCE PAUL (_reading_). ""The rights of humanity!"" In the old times men carried out their rights for themselves as they lived, but nowadays every baby seems born with a social manifesto in its mouth much bigger than itself.[7] ""Nature is not a temple, but a workshop: we demand the right to labour."" Ah, I shall surrender my own rights in that respect.  VERA (_pacing up and down behind_). Oh, will he never come? will he never come?  PRINCE PAUL. ""The family as subversive of true socialistic and communal unity is to be annihilated."" Yes, President, I agree completely with Article 5. A family is a terrible incumbrance, especially when one is not married. (_Three knocks at the door._)  VERA. Alexis at last!  _Password._ V? tyrannis!  _Answer._ V? victis!  (_Enter MICHAEL STROGANOFF._)  PRES.[8] Michael, the regicide! Brothers, let us do honour to a man who has killed a king.  [9]VERA (_aside_). Oh, he will come yet.[9]  PRES. Michael, you have saved Russia.  MICH. Ay, Russia was free for a moment [10]when the tyrant fell, but the sun of liberty has set again like that false dawn which cheats our eyes in autumn.  PRES. The dread night of tyranny is not yet past for Russia.  MICH. (_clutching his knife_).[10] One more blow, and the end is come indeed.  VERA (_aside_). One more blow! What does he mean? Oh, impossible! but why is he not with us? Alexis! Alexis! why are you not here?  PRES. But how did you escape, Michael? They said you had been seized.  MICH. I was dressed in the uniform of the Imperial Guard. The Colonel on duty was a brother, and gave me the password. I drove through the troops in safety with it, and, thanks to my good horse, reached the walls before the gates were closed.  PRES. What a chance his coming out on the balcony was!  MICH. A chance? There is no such thing as chance. It was God's finger led him there.  PRES. And where have you been these three days?  MICH. Hiding in the house of the priest Nicholas at the cross-roads.  PRES. Nicholas is an honest man.  MICH. Ay, honest enough for a priest. I am here now for vengeance on a traitor!  VERA (_aside_). O God, will he never come? Alexis! why are you not here? You cannot have turned traitor!  MICH. (_seeing PRINCE PAUL_). Prince Paul Maraloffski here! By St. George, a lucky capture! This must have been Vera's doing. She is the only one who could have lured that serpent into the trap.  PRES. Prince Paul has just taken the oath.  VERA. Alexis, the Czar, has banished him from Russia.  MICH. Bah! A blind to cheat us. We will keep Prince Paul here, [11]and find some office for him in our reign of terror.[11] He is well accustomed by this time to bloody work.  PRINCE PAUL (_approaching MICHAEL_). That was a long shot of yours, mon camarade.  MICH. I have had a good deal of practice shooting, since I have been a boy, off your Highness's wild boars.  PRINCE PAUL. Are my gamekeepers like moles, then, always asleep?  MICH. No, Prince. I am one of them; but, like you, I am fond of robbing what I am put to watch.  PRES. This must be a new atmosphere for you, Prince Paul. We speak the truth to one another here.  PRINCE PAUL. How misleading you must find it. You have an odd medley here, President--a little rococo, I am afraid.  PRES. You recognise a good many friends, I dare say?  PRINCE PAUL. Yes, there is always more brass than brains in an aristocracy.  PRES. But you are here yourself?  PRINCE PAUL. I? As I cannot be Prime Minister, I must be a Nihilist. There is no alternative.  VERA. O God, will he never come? The hand is on the stroke of the hour. Will he never come?  MICH. (_aside_). President, you know what we have to do? 'Tis but a sorry hunter who leaves the wolf cub alive to avenge his father. How are we to get at this boy? It must be to-night. To-morrow he will be throwing some sop of reform to the people, and it will be too late for a Republic.  PRINCE PAUL. You are quite right. Good kings are the enemies of Democracy, and when he has begun by banishing me you may be sure he intends to be a patriot.  MICH. I am sick of patriot kings; [12]what Russia needs is a Republic.[12]  PRINCE PAUL. Messieurs, I have brought you two documents which I think will interest you--the proclamation this young Czar intends publishing to-morrow, and a plan of the Winter Palace, where he sleeps to-night. (_Hands paper._)  VERA. [13]I dare not ask them what they are plotting about.[13] Oh, why is Alexis not here?  PRES. Prince, this is most valuable information. Michael, you were right. If it is not to-night it will be too late. Read that.  MICH. Ah! A loaf of bread flung to a starving nation. [14]A lie to cheat the people.[14] (_Tears it up._) It must be to-night. I do not believe in him. Would he have kept his crown had he loved the people? But how are we to get at him?  PRINCE PAUL. The key of the private door in the street. (_Hands key._)  PRES. Prince, we are in your debt.  PRINCE PAUL (_smiling_). The normal condition of the Nihilists.  MICH. Ay, but we are paying our debts off with interest now. Two Emperors in one week. That will make the balance straight. We would have thrown in a Prime Minister if you had not come.  PRINCE PAUL. Ah, I am sorry you told me. It robs my visit of all its picturesqueness and adventure. I thought I was perilling my head by coming here, and you tell me I have saved it. One is sure to be disappointed if one tries to get romance out of modern life.  MICH. It is not so romantic a thing to lose one's head, Prince Paul.  PRINCE PAUL. No, but it must often be very dull to keep it. Don't you find that sometimes? (_Clock strikes six._)  VERA (_sinking into a seat_). Oh, it is past the hour! It is past the hour!  MICH. (_to PRESIDENT_). Remember to-morrow will be too late.  PRES. Brothers, it is full time. Which of us is absent?  CONSPS. Alexis! Alexis!  PRES. Michael, read Rule 7.  MICH. ""When any brother shall have disobeyed a summons to be present, the President shall enquire if there is anything alleged against him.""  PRES. Is there anything against our brother Alexis?  CONSPS. He wears a crown! He wears a crown!  PRES. Michael, read Article 7 of the Code of Revolution.  MICH. ""Between the Nihilists and all men who wear crowns above their fellows, there is war to the death.""  PRES. Brothers, what say you? Is Alexis, the Czar, guilty or not?  OMNES. He is guilty!  PRES. What shall the penalty be?  OMNES. Death!  PRES. Let the lots be prepared; it shall be to-night.  PRINCE PAUL. Ah, this is really interesting! I was getting afraid conspiracies were as dull as courts are.  PROF. MARFA. My forte is more in writing pamphlets than in taking shots. Still a regicide has always a place in history.  MICH. If your pistol is as harmless as your pen, this young tyrant will have a long life.  PRINCE PAUL. You ought to remember, too, Professor, that if you were seized, as you probably would be, and hung, as you certainly would be, there would be nobody left to read your own articles.  PRES. Brothers, are you ready?  VERA (_starting up_). Not yet! Not yet! I have a word to say.  MICH. (_aside_). [15]Plague take her! I knew it would come to this.[15]  VERA. This boy has been our brother. Night after night he has perilled his own life to come here. [16]Night after night, when every street was filled with spies, every house with traitors.[16] Delicately nurtured like a king's son, he has dwelt among us.  PRES. Ay! under a false name. [17]He lied to us at the beginning. He lies to us now at the end.[17]  VERA. I swear he is true. There is not a man here who does not owe him his life a thousand times. When the bloodhounds were on us that night, who saved us [18]from arrest, torture, flogging, death,[18] but he ye seek to kill?--  MICH. To kill all tyrants is our mission!  VERA. He is no tyrant. I know him well! He loves the people.  PRES. We know him too; he is a traitor.  VERA. A traitor! Three days ago he could have betrayed every man of you here, [19]and the gibbet would have been your doom.[19] He gave you all your lives once. Give him a little time--a week, a month, a few days; but not now!--O God,[20] not now!  CONSPS. (_brandishing daggers_). To-night! to-night! to-night!  VERA. Peace, you gorged adders; peace!  MICH. What, are we not here to annihilate? shall we not keep our oath?  VERA. Your oath! your oath! [21]Greedy that you are of gain, every man's hand lusting for his neighbour's pelf, every heart set on pillage and rapine;[21] who, of ye all, if the crown were set on his head, would give an empire up for the mob to scramble for? The people are not yet fit for a Republic in Russia.  PRES. Every nation is fit for a Republic.  MICH. The man is a tyrant.  VERA. A tyrant! Hath he not dismissed his evil counsellors. That ill-omened raven of his father's life hath had his wings clipped and his claws pared, and comes to us croaking for revenge. Oh, have mercy on him![22] Give him a week to live!  PRES. Vera pleading for a king!  VERA (_proudly_). I plead not for a king, but for a brother.  MICH. For a traitor to his oath, for a coward who should have flung the purple back to the fools that gave it to him. No, Vera, no. The brood of men is not dead yet, nor the dull earth grown sick of child-bearing. No crowned man in Russia shall pollute God's air by living.  PRES. You bade us try you once; we have tried you, and you are found wanting.  MICH. Vera, I am not blind; I know your secret. You love this boy, this young prince with his pretty face, his curled hair, his soft white hands. Fool that you are, dupe of a lying tongue, do you know what he would have done to you, this boy you think loved you? He would have made you his mistress, used your body at his pleasure, thrown you away when he was wearied of you; you, the priestess of liberty, the flame of Revolution, the torch of democracy.  VERA. What he would have done to me matters little. To the people, at least, he will be true. He loves the people--at least, he loves liberty.  PRES. So he would play the citizen-king, would he, while we starve? [23]Would flatter us with sweet speeches, would cheat us with promises like his father, would lie to us as his whole race have lied.[23]  MICH. And you whose very name made every despot tremble for his life, you, Vera Sabouroff, you would betray liberty for a lover and the people for a paramour!  CONSPS. [24]Traitress! Draw the lots; draw the lots![24]  VERA. In thy throat thou liest, Michael! I love him not. He loves me not.  MICH. You love him not? Shall he not die then?  VERA (_with an effort, clenching her hands_). Ay, it is right that he should die. He hath broken his oath. [25]There should be no crowned man in Europe. Have I not sworn it? To be strong our new Republic should be drunk with the blood of kings. He hath broken his oath. As the father died so let the son die too.[25] Yet not to-night, not to-night. Russia, that hath borne her centuries of wrong, can wait a week for liberty. Give him a week.  PRES. We will have none of you! Begone from us to this boy you love.  MICH. Though I find him in your arms I shall kill him.  CONSPS. To-night! To-night! To-night!  MICH. (_holding up his hand_). A moment! I have something to say. (_Approaches VERA; speaks very slowly._) Vera Sabouroff, have you forgotten your brother? (_Pauses to see effect; VERA starts._) Have you forgotten that young face, pale with famine; those young limbs twisted with torture; the iron chains they made him walk in? What week of liberty did they give him? What pity did they show him for a day? (_VERA falls in a chair._) Oh! you could talk glibly enough then of vengeance, glibly enough of liberty. When you said you would come to Moscow, your old father caught you by the knees and begged you not to leave him childless and alone.[26] I seem to hear his cries still ringing in my ears, but you were as deaf to him as the rocks on the roadside; as chill and cold as the snow on the hill. You left your father that night, and three weeks after he died of a broken heart. You wrote to me to follow you here. I did so; first because I loved you; but you soon cured me of that; whatever gentle feeling, whatever pity, whatever humanity, was in my heart you withered up and destroyed, as the canker worm eats the corn, and the plague kills the child. You bade me cast out love from my breast as a vile thing, you turned my hand to iron, and my heart to stone; you told me to live for freedom and for revenge. I have done so; but you, what have you done?  VERA. Let the lots be drawn! (_CONSPIRATORS applaud._)  PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). Ah, the Grand Duke will come to the throne sooner than he expected. He is sure to make a good king under my guidance. He is so cruel to animals, and never keeps his word.  MICH. Now you are yourself at last, Vera.  VERA (_standing motionless in the middle_). The lots, I say, the lots! I am no woman now. My blood seems turned to gall; my heart is as cold as steel is; my hand shall be more deadly. From the desert and the tomb the voice of my prisoned brother cries aloud, and bids me strike one blow for liberty. The lots, I say, the lots!  PRES. Are you ready. Michael, you have the right to draw first; you are a Regicide.  VERA. O God, into my hands! Into my hands! (_They draw the lots from a bowl surmounted by a skull._)  PRES. Open your lots.  VERA (_opening her lot_). The lot is mine! see the bloody sign upon it! Dmitri, my brother, you shall have your revenge now.  PRES. Vera Sabouroff, you are chosen to be a regicide. God has been good to you. The dagger or the poison? (_Offers her dagger and vial._)  VERA. I can trust my hand better with the dagger; it never fails. (_Take dagger._) I shall stab him to the heart, as he has stabbed me. Traitor, to leave us for a ribbon, a gaud, a bauble, to lie to me every day he came here, to forget us in an hour. [27]Michael was right, he loved me not, nor the people either.[27] Methinks that if I was a mother and bore a man-child I would poison my breast to him, lest he might grow to a traitor or to a king. (_PRINCE PAUL whispers to the PRESIDENT._)  PRES. Ay, Prince Paul, that is the best way. Vera, the Czar[28] sleeps to-night in his own room in the north wing of the palace. Here is the key of the private door in the street. The passwords of the guards will be given to you. His own servants will be drugged. You will find him alone.  VERA. It is well. I shall not fail.  PRES. We will wait outside in the Place St. Isaac, under the window. As the clock strikes twelve from the tower of St. Nicholas you will give us the sign that the dog is dead.  VERA. And what shall the sign be?  PRES. You are to throw us out the bloody dagger.  MICH. Dripping with the traitor's life.  PRES. Else we shall know that you have been seized, and we will burst our way in, drag you from his guards.  MICH. And kill him in the midst of them.  PRES. Michael, you will head us?  MICH. Ay, I shall head you. See that your hand fails not, Vera Sabouroff.  [29]VERA. Fool, is it so hard a thing to kill one's enemy.[29]  PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). This is the ninth conspiracy I have been in in Russia. They always end in a ""voyage en Siberie"" for my friends and a new decoration for myself.  MICH. It is your last conspiracy, Prince.  PRES. At twelve o'clock, the bloody dagger.  VERA. Ay, red with the blood of that false heart. I shall not forget it. (_Standing in the middle of the stage._) [30]To strangle whatever nature is in me, neither to love nor to be loved, neither to pity nor to be pitied. Ay! it is an oath, an oath. Methinks the spirit of Charlotte Corday has entered my soul now. I shall carve my name on the world, and be ranked among the great heroines. Ay! the spirit of Charlotte Corday beats in each petty vein, and nerves my woman's hand to strike, as I have nerved my woman's heart to hate. Though he laughs in his dreams, I shall not falter. Though he sleep peacefully I shall not miss my blow.[30] Be glad, my brother, in your stifled cell; be glad and laugh to-night. To-night this new-fledged Czar shall post with bloody feet to Hell, and greet his father there! [31]This Czar! O traitor, liar, false to his oath, false to me! To play the patriot amongst us, and now to wear a crown; to sell us, like Judas, for thirty silver pieces, to betray us with a kiss![31] (_With more passion._) O Liberty, O mighty mother of eternal time, thy robe is purple with the blood of those who have died for thee! Thy throne is the Calvary of the people, thy crown the crown of thorns. O crucified mother, the despot has driven a nail through thy right hand, and the tyrant through thy left! Thy feet are pierced with their iron. When thou wert athirst thou calledst on the priests for water, and they gave thee bitter drink. They thrust a sword into thy side. They mocked thee in thine agony of age on age. [32]Here, on thy altar, O Liberty, do I dedicate myself to thy service; do with me as thou wilt![32] (_Brandishing dagger._) The end has come now, and by thy sacred wounds, O crucified mother, O Liberty, I swear that Russia shall be saved!  ACT"|2
91|" IV.  SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the back, with drawn curtains over it._  _Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT ROUVALOFF.   PRINCE PETRO. He is beginning well, this young Czar.  BARON RAFF (_shrugs his shoulders_). All young Czars do begin well.  COUNT R. And end badly.  [1]MARQ. DE POIV. Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one good service, at any rate.  PRINCE PETRO. Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?  MARQ. DE POIV. Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an hour.[1]  (_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)  BARON RAFF. Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor?  GEN. KOTEMK. You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.  PRINCE PETRO. Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than common murderers!  COUNT R. And the other half much worse?  BARON RAFF. Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has always been more respectable than retail.  COUNT R. But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to have cheap salt.  MARQ. DE POIV. Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern provinces. (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)  PRINCE PETRO. Quelle b?tise! The more starvation there is among the people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue, Baron, an excellent virtue.  BARON RAFF. I have often heard so; I have often heard so.  GEN. KOTEMK. He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the people should have deputies to represent them.  BARON RAFF. As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already, but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.  MARQ. DE POIV. He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says she must have a new diamond bracelet.  COUNT R. (_aside to BARON RAFF_). Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave her last week, I suppose.  PRINCE PETRO. I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.  BARON RAFF. What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!  GEN. KOTEMK. You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.  PRINCE PETRO. My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He seems to get married three times a week regularly.  GEN. KOT. Well, he wants a dowry to console him.  COUNT R. I am sick of town. I want a house in the country.  MARQ. DE POIV. I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.  BARON RAFF. Mes amis, I am extremely sorry for you. It is out of the question.  PRINCE PETRO. But my son, Baron?  GEN. KOTEMK. But my nephew?  MARQ. DE POIV. But my house in town?  COUNT R. But my house in the country?  MARQ. DE POIV. But my wife's diamond bracelet?  BARON RAFF. Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead; the funeral begins to-day.  COUNT R. Then I shall wait for the resurrection.  PRINCE PETRO. Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?  BARON RAFF. What have we always done in Russia when a Czar suggests reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but they always end in a farce.  COUNT R. I wish Prince Paul were here. [3]By the bye, I think this boy is rather ungrateful to him. If that clever old Prince had not proclaimed him Emperor at once without giving him time to think about it, he would have given up his crown, I believe, to the first cobbler he met in the street.  PRINCE PETRO. But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really going?[3]  BARON RAFF. He is exiled.  PRINCE PETRO. Yes; but is he going?  BARON RAFF. I am sure of it; at least he told me he had sent two telegrams already to Paris about his dinner.  COUNT R. Ah! that settles the matter.  CZAR (_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and order (_counting them_) six extra places.  BARON RAFF. The devil!  CZAR. No, Baron, the Czar. Traitors! There would be no bad kings in the world if there were no bad ministers like you. It is men such as you who wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness. Our mother, Russia, hath no need of such unnatural sons. You can make no atonement now; it is too late for that. The grave cannot give back your dead, nor the gibbet your martyrs, but I shall be more merciful to you. I give you your lives! That is the curse I would lay on you. But if there is a man of you found in Moscow by to-morrow night your heads will be off your shoulders.  BARON RAFF. You remind us wonderfully, Sire, of your Imperial father.  CZAR. I banish you all from Russia. Your estates are confiscated to the people. You may carry your titles with you. Reforms in Russia, Baron, always end in a farce. You will have a good opportunity, Prince Petrovitch, of practising self-denial, that excellent virtue! that excellent virtue! So, Baron, you think a Parliament in Russia would be merely a place for brawling. Well, I will see that the reports of each session are sent to you regularly.  BARON RAFF. Sire, you are adding another horror to exile.  CZAR. But you will have such time for literature now. You forget you are diplomatists. Men of thought should have nothing to do with action.  PRINCE PETRO. Sire, we did but jest.  CZAR. Then I banish you for your bad jokes. Bon voyage, Messieurs.[4] If you value your lives you will catch the first train for Paris. (_Exeunt MINISTERS._) Russia is well rid of such men as these. They are the jackals that follow in the lion's track. [5]They have no courage themselves, except to pillage and rob.[5] But for these men and for Prince Paul my father would have been a good king, would not have died so horribly as he did die. How strange it is, the most real parts of one's life always seem to be a dream! The council, the fearful law which was to kill the people, the arrest, the cry in the courtyard, the pistol-shot, my father's bloody hands, and then the crown! One can live for years sometimes, without living at all, and then all life comes crowding into a single hour. I had no time to think. Before my father's hideous shriek of death had died in my ears I found this crown on my head, the purple robe around me, and heard myself called a king. I would have given it up all then; it seemed nothing to me then; but now, can I give it up now? Well, Colonel, well? (_Enter COLONEL OF THE GUARD._)  COLONEL. What password does your Imperial Majesty desire should be given to-night?  CZAR. Password?  COLONEL. [6]For the cordon of[6] guards, Sire, on night duty around the palace.  CZAR. You can dismiss them. I have no need of them. (_Exit COLONEL._) (_Goes to the crown lying on the table._) What subtle potency lies hidden in this gaudy bauble, the crown,[7] that makes one feel like a god when one wears it? To hold in one's hand this little fiery coloured world, to reach out one's arm to earth's uttermost limit, to girdle the seas with one's hosts; this is to wear a crown! to wear a crown! The meanest serf in Russia who is loved is better crowned than I. How love outweighs the balance! How poor appears the widest empire of this golden world when matched with love! Pent up in this palace, with spies dogging every step, I have heard nothing of her; I have not seen her once since that fearful hour three days ago, when I found myself suddenly the Czar of this wide waste, Russia. Oh, could I see her for a moment; tell her now the secret of my life I have never dared utter before; tell her why I wear this crown, when I have sworn eternal war against all crowned men! There was a meeting to-night. I received my summons by an unknown hand; but how could I go? I who have broken my oath! who have broken my oath!  (_Enter PAGE._)  PAGE. It is after eleven, Sire. Shall I take the first watch in your room to-night?  CZAR. Why should you watch me, boy? The stars are my best sentinels.  PAGE. It was your Imperial father's wish, Sire, never to be left alone while he slept.  CZAR. My father was troubled with bad dreams. Go, get to your bed, boy; it is nigh on midnight, and these late hours will spoil those red cheeks. (_PAGE tries to kiss his hand._) Nay, nay; we have played together too often as children for that. Oh, to breathe the same air as her, and not to see her! the light seems to have gone from my life, the sun vanished from my day.  PAGE. Sire,--Alexis,--let me stay with[8] you to-night! There is some danger over you; I feel there is.  CZAR. What should I fear? I have banished all my enemies from Russia. Set the brazier here, by me; it is very cold, and I would sit by it for a time. Go, boy, go; I have much to think about to-night. (_Goes to back of stage, draws aside curtain. View of Moscow by moonlight._) The snow has fallen heavily since sunset. How white and cold my city looks under this pale moon! And yet, what hot and fiery hearts beat in this icy Russia, for all its frost and snow! Oh, to see her for a moment; to tell her all; to tell her why I am a king! But she does not doubt me; she said she would trust in me. Though I have broken my oath, she will have trust. It is very cold. Where is my cloak? I shall sleep for an hour. Then I have ordered my sledge, and, though I die for it, I shall see Vera to-night. Did I not bid thee go, boy? What! must I play the tyrant so soon? Go, go! I cannot live without seeing her. My horses will be here in an hour; one hour between me and love! How heavy this charcoal fire smells. (_Exit the PAGE. Lies down on a couch beside brazier._)  (_Enter VERA in a black cloak._)  VERA. Asleep! God, thou art good! Who shall deliver him from my hands now? [9]This is he! The democrat who would make himself a king, the republican who hath worn a crown, the traitor who hath lied to us. Michael was right. He loved not the people. He loved me not.[9] (_Bends over him._) Oh, why should such deadly poison lie in such sweet lips? Was there not gold enough in his hair before, that he should tarnish it with this crown? But my day has come now; the day of the people, of liberty, has come! Your day, my brother, has come! Though I have strangled whatever nature is in me, I did not think it had been so easy to kill. One blow and it is over, and I can wash my hands in water afterwards, I can wash my hands afterwards. Come, I shall save Russia. I have sworn it. (_Raises dagger to strike._)  CZAR (_staring up, seizes her by both hands_). Vera, you here! My dream was no dream at all. Why have you left me three days alone, when I most needed you? O God, you think I am a traitor, a liar, a king? I am, for love of you. Vera, it was for you I broke my oath and wear my father's crown. I would lay at your feet this mighty Russia, which you and I have loved so well; would give you this earth as a footstool! set this crown on your head. The people will love us. We will rule them by love, as a father rules his children. There shall be liberty in Russia for every man to think as his heart bids him; liberty for men to speak as they think. I have banished the wolves that preyed on us; I have brought back your brother from Siberia; I have opened the blackened jaws of the mine. The courier is already on his way; within a week Dmitri and all those with him will be back in their own land. The people shall be free--are free now--and you and I, Emperor and Empress of this mighty realm, will walk among them openly, in love. When they gave me this crown first, I would have flung it back to them, had it not been for you, Vera. O God! It is men's custom in Russia to bring gifts to those they love. I said, I will bring to the woman I love a people, an empire, a world! Vera, it is for you, for you alone, I kept this crown; for you alone I am a king. Oh, I have loved you better than my oath! Why will you not speak to me? You love me not! You love me not! You have come to warn me of some plot against my life. What is life worth to me without you? (_CONSPIRATORS murmur outside._)  VERA. Oh, lost! lost! lost!  CZAR. Nay, you are safe here. It wants five hours still of dawn. To-morrow, I will lead you forth to the whole people--  VERA. To-morrow--!  CZAR. Will crown you with my own hands as Empress in that great cathedral which my fathers built.  VERA (_loosens her hands violently from him, and starts up_). I am a Nihilist! I cannot wear a crown!  CZAR (_falls at her feet_). I am no king now. I am only a boy who has loved you better than his honour, better than his oath. For love of the people I would have been a patriot. For love of you I have been a traitor. Let us go forth together, we will live amongst the common people. I am no king. I will toil for you like the peasant or the serf. Oh, love me a little too! (_CONSPIRATORS murmur outside._)  VERA (_clutching dagger_). To strangle whatever nature is in me, neither to love nor to be loved, neither to pity nor---- Oh, I am a woman! God help me, I am a woman! O Alexis! I too have broken my oath; I am a traitor. I love. Oh, do not speak, do not speak--(_kisses his lips_)--the first, the last time. (_He clasps her in his arms; they sit on the couch together._)  CZAR. I could die now.  VERA. What does death do in thy lips? Thy life, thy love are enemies of death. Speak not of death. Not yet, not yet.  CZAR. I know not why death came into my heart. Perchance the cup of life is filled too full of pleasure to endure. This is our wedding night.  VERA. Our wedding night!  CZAR. And if death came himself, methinks that I could kiss his pallid mouth, and suck sweet poison from it.  VERA. Our wedding night! Nay, nay. Death should not sit at the feast. There is no such thing as death.  CZAR. There shall not be for us. (_CONSPIRATORS murmur outside._)  VERA. What is that? Did you not hear something?  CZAR. Only your voice, that fowler's note which lures my heart away like a poor bird upon the limed twig.  VERA. Methought that some one laughed.  CZAR. It was but the wind and rain; the night is full of storm. (_CONSPIRATORS murmur outside._)  VERA. It should be so indeed. Oh, where are your guards? where are your guards?  CZAR. Where should they be but at home? I shall not live pent round by sword and steel. The love of a people is a king's best body-guard.  VERA. The love of a people!  CZAR. Sweet, you are safe here. Nothing can harm you here. O love, I knew you trusted me! You said you would have trust.  VERA. I have had trust. O love, the past seems but some dull grey dream from which our souls have wakened. This is life at last.  CZAR. Ay, life at last.  VERA. Our wedding night! Oh, let me drink my fill of love to-night! Nay, sweet, not yet, not yet. How still it is, and yet methinks the air is full of music. It is some nightingale who, wearying of the south, has come to sing in this bleak north to lovers such as we. It is the nightingale. Dost thou not hear it?  CZAR. Oh, sweet, mine ears are clogged to all sweet sounds save thine own voice, and mine eyes blinded to all sights but thee, else had I heard that nightingale, and seen the golden-vestured morning sun itself steal from its sombre east before its time for jealousy that thou art twice as fair.  VERA. Yet would that thou hadst heard the nightingale. Methinks that bird will never sing again.  CZAR. It is no nightingale. 'Tis love himself singing for very ecstasy of joy that thou art changed into his votaress. (_Clock begins striking twelve._) Oh, listen, sweet, it is the lover's hour. Come, let us stand without, and hear the midnight answered from tower to tower over the wide white town. Our wedding night! What is that? What is that?  (_Loud murmurs of CONSPIRATORS in the street._)  VERA (_breaks from him and rushes across the stage_). The wedding guests are here already! Ay, you shall have your sign! (_Stabs herself._) You shall have your sign! (_Rushes to the window._)  CZAR (_intercepts her by rushing between her and window, and snatches dagger out of her hand_). Vera!  VERA (_clinging to him_). Give me back the dagger! Give me back the dagger! There are men in the street who seek your life! Your guards have betrayed you! This bloody dagger is the signal that you are dead. (_CONSPIRATORS begin to shout below in the street._) Oh, there is not a moment to be lost! Throw it out! Throw it out! Nothing can save me now; this dagger is poisoned! I feel death already in my heart.  CZAR (_holding dagger out of her reach_). Death is in my heart too; we shall die together.  VERA. Oh, love! love! love! be merciful to me! The wolves are hot upon you! you must live for liberty, for Russia, for me! Oh, you do not love me! You offered me an empire once! Give me this dagger now! Oh, you are cruel! My life for yours! What does it matter? (_Loud shouts in the street, ""VERA! VERA! To the rescue! To the rescue!_"")  CZAR. The bitterness of death is past for me.  VERA. Oh, they are breaking in below! See! The bloody man behind you! (_CZAREVITCH turns round for an instant._) Ah! (_VERA snatches dagger and flings it out of window._)  CONSPS. (_below_). Long live the people!  CZAR. What have you done?  VERA. I have saved Russia (_Dies._)                                    SCENE  _Morning-room of Lord Windermere's house in Carlton House Terrace_. _Doors C. and R.  Bureau with books and papers R._  _Sofa with small tea-table L._  _Window opening on to terrace L._  _Table R._  [LADY WINDERMERE _is at table R._, _arranging roses in a blue bowl_.]  [_Enter_ PARKER.]  PARKER.  Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes?who has called?  PARKER.  Lord Darlington, my lady.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Hesitates for a moment_.]  Show him up?and I?m at home to any one who calls.  PARKER.  Yes, my lady.                                                                 [_Exit C._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  It's best for me to see him before to-night.  I?m glad he's come.  [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]  PARKER.  Lord Darlington,  [_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON _C._]                                                            [_Exit_ PARKER.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can?t shake hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren?t they lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.  LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn?t it!  It's got my name on it, and everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It's my husband's birthday present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?  LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I?m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my life, isn?t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for you.                                                          [_A short pause_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.  LORD DARLINGTON.  I, Lady Windermere?  [_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.] Won?t you come over, Lord Darlington?                                                        [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at table L._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the whole evening.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They?re the only things we _can_ pay.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously. You mustn?t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don?t like compliments, and I don?t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn?t mean.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers him_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that. But I shouldn?t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes think you pretend to be worse.  LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated at table L._]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides, there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn?t.  Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Don?t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then, Lord Darlington?  LORD DARLINGTON.  No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down to the bores.  I should like _you_ to take me very seriously, Lady Windermere, _you_ more than any one else in life.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why?why me?  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_After a slight hesitation_.]  Because I think we might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend some day.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you say that?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Oh!?we all want friends at times.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I think we?re very good friends already, Lord Darlington.  We can always remain so as long as you don?t?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Don?t what?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Don?t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to me.  You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?  Well, I have something of the Puritan in me.  I was brought up like that.  I am glad of it.  My mother died when I was a mere child.  I lived always with Lady Julia, my father's elder sister, you know.  She was stern to me, but she taught me what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what is right and what is wrong.  _She_ allowed of no compromise.  _I_ allow of none.  LORD DARLINGTON.  My dear Lady Windermere!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Leaning back on the sofa_.]  You look on me as being behind the age.?Well, I am!  I should be sorry to be on the same level as an age like this.  LORD DARLINGTON.  You think the age very bad?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Nowadays people seem to look on life as a speculation.  It is not a speculation.  It is a sacrament.  Its ideal is Love.  Its purification is sacrifice.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Oh, anything is better than being sacrificed!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Leaning forward_.]  Don?t say that.  LORD DARLINGTON.  I do say it.  I feel it?I know it.  [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]  PARKER.  The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the terrace for to-night, my lady?  LADY WINDERMERE.  You don?t think it will rain, Lord Darlington, do you?  LORD DARLINGTON.  I won?t hear of its raining on your birthday!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Tell them to do it at once, Parker.                                                        [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated_.]  Do you think then?of course I am only putting an imaginary instance?do you think that in the case of a young married couple, say about two years married, if the husband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman of?well, more than doubtful character?is always calling upon her, lunching with her, and probably paying her bills?do you think that the wife should not console herself?  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Frowning_.]  Console herself?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Yes, I think she should?I think she has the right.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Because the husband is vile'should the wife be vile also?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world.  Certainly the greatest harm they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance.  It is absurd to divide people into good and bad.  People are either charming or tedious. I take the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can?t help belonging to them.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Now, Lord Darlington.  [_Rising and crossing R._, _front of him_.]  Don?t stir, I am merely going to finish my flowers. [_Goes to table R.C._]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Rising and moving chair_.]  And I must say I think you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere.  Of course there is much against it, I admit.  Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather mercenary.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Don?t talk about such people.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who have committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing at table_.]  I think they should never be forgiven.  LORD DARLINGTON.  And men?  Do you think that there should be the same laws for men as there are for women?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Certainly!  LORD DARLINGTON.  I think life too complex a thing to be settled by these hard and fast rules.  LADY WINDERMERE.  If we had ?these hard and fast rules,? we should find life much more simple.  LORD DARLINGTON.  You allow of no exceptions?  LADY WINDERMERE.  None!  LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady Windermere!  LADY WINDERMERE.  The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.  LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldn?t help it.  I can resist everything except temptation.  LADY WINDERMERE.  You have the modern affectation of weakness.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Looking at her_.]  It's only an affectation, Lady Windermere.  [_Enter_ PARKER _C._]  PARKER.  The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.  [_Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE _C._]                                                        [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Coming down C._, _and shaking hands_.]  Dear Margaret, I am so pleased to see you.  You remember Agatha, don?t you? [_Crossing L.C._]  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  I won?t let you know my daughter, you are far too wicked.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Don?t say that, Duchess.  As a wicked man I am a complete failure.  Why, there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course they only say it behind my back.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Isn?t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington. Mind you don?t believe a word he says.  [LORD DARLINGTON _crosses R.C._] No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa_.]  We have just had tea at Lady Markby's.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable. I wasn?t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn?t think it is going to be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A small and early.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Standing L.C._]  Very small, very early, and very select, Duchess.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_On sofa L._]  Of course it's going to be select. But we know _that_, dear Margaret, about _your_ house.  It is really one of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, and where I feel perfectly secure about dear Berwick.  I don?t know what society is coming to.  The most dreadful people seem to g"|2
92|o everywhere.  They certainly come to my parties?the men get quite furious if one doesn?t ask them.  Really, some one should make a stand against it.  LADY WINDERMERE.  _I_ will, Duchess.  I will have no one in my house about whom there is any scandal.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_R.C._]  Oh, don?t say that, Lady Windermere.  I should never be admitted!  [_Sitting_.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, men don?t matter.  With women it is different. We?re good.  Some of us are, at least.  But we are positively getting elbowed into the corner.  Our husbands would really forget our existence if we didn?t nag at them from time to time, just to remind them that we have a perfect legal right to do so.  LORD DARLINGTON.  It's a curious thing, Duchess, about the game of marriage?a game, by the way, that is going out of fashion?the wives hold all the honours, and invariably lose the odd trick.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.   The odd trick?  Is that the husband, Lord Darlington?  LORD DARLINGTON.  It would be rather a good name for the modern husband.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depraved you are!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington is trivial.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, don?t say that, Lady Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you _talk_ so trivially about life, then?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Because I think that life is far too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.  [_Moves up C._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Coming down back of table_.]  I think I had better not, Duchess.  Nowadays to be intelligible is to be found out.  Good-bye! [_Shakes hands with_ DUCHESS.]  And now?[_goes up stage_] Lady Windermere, good-bye.  I may come to-night, mayn?t I?  Do let me come.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing up stage with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Yes, certainly.  But you are not to say foolish, insincere things to people.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and exit C._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Who has risen_, _goes C._]  What a charming, wicked creature!  I like him so much.  I?m quite delighted he's gone! How sweet you?re looking!  Where _do_ you get your gowns?  And now I must tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.  [_Crosses to sofa and sits with_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  Agatha, darling!  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Rises_.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go and look over the photograph album that I see there?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  [_Goes to table up L._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear girl!  She is so fond of photographs of Switzerland.  Such a pure taste, I think.  But I really am so sorry for you, Margaret.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling_.]  Why, Duchess?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, on account of that horrid woman.  She dresses so well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such a dreadful example. Augustus?you know my disreputable brother'such a trial to us all?well, Augustus is completely infatuated about her.  It is quite scandalous, for she is absolutely inadmissible into society.  Many a woman has a past, but I am told that she has at least a dozen, and that they all fit.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Whom are you talking about, Duchess?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  About Mrs. Erlynne.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne?  I never heard of her, Duchess.  And what _has_ she to do with me?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  My poor child!  Agatha, darling!  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Will you go out on the terrace and look at the sunset?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.                                               [_Exit through window_, _L._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Sweet girl!  So devoted to sunsets!  Shows such refinement of feeling, does it not?  After all, there is nothing like Nature, is there?  LADY WINDERMERE.  But what is it, Duchess?  Why do you talk to me about this person?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Don?t you really know?  I assure you we?re all so distressed about it.  Only last night at dear Lady Jansen's every one was saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, Windermere should behave in such a way.  LADY WINDERMERE.  My husband?what has _he_ got to do with any woman of that kind?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah, what indeed, dear?  That is the point.  He goes to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, and while he is there she is not at home to any one.  Not that many ladies call on her, dear, but she has a great many disreputable men friends?my own brother particularly, as I told you?and that is what makes it so dreadful about Windermere.  We looked upon _him_ as being such a model husband, but I am afraid there is no doubt about it.  My dear nieces?you know the Saville girls, don?t you?'such nice domestic creatures?plain, dreadfully plain, but so good?well, they?re always at the window doing fancy work, and making ugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in these dreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken a house in Curzon Street, right opposite them'such a respectable street, too!  I don?t know what we?re coming to!  And they tell me that Windermere goes there four and five times a week?they _see_ him.  They can?t help it?and although they never talk scandal, they?well, of course?they remark on it to every one.  And the worst of it all is that I have been told that this woman has got a great deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that she came to London six months ago without anything at all to speak of, and now she has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in the Park every afternoon and all?well, all'since she has known poor dear Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, I can?t believe it!  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  But it's quite true, my dear.  The whole of London knows it.  That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where he?ll have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day long.  I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.  He was so extremely susceptible.  Though I am bound to say he never gave away any large sums of money to anybody.  He is far too high-principled for that!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Interrupting_.]  Duchess, Duchess, it's impossible! [_Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.  Our child is but six months old.  [_Sits in chair R. of L. table_.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah, the dear pretty baby!  How is the little darling?  Is it a boy or a girl?  I hope a girl?Ah, no, I remember it's a boy!  I?m so sorry.  Boys are so wicked.  My boy is excessively immoral. You wouldn?t believe at what hours he comes home.  And he's only left Oxford a few months?I really don?t know what they teach them there.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Are _all_ men bad?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Oh, all of them, my dear, all of them, without any exception.  And they never grow any better.  Men become old, but they never become good.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Windermere and I married for love.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Yes, we begin like that.  It was only Berwick's brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all, and before the year was out, he was running after all kinds of petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material.  In fact, before the honeymoon was over, I caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty, respectable girl.  I dismissed her at once without a character.?No, I remember I passed her on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so short-sighted, I thought it wouldn?t matter.  But it did, though?it was most unfortunate.  [_Rises_.]  And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out.  And mind you don?t take this little aberration of Windermere's too much to heart.  Just take him abroad, and he?ll come back to you all right.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Come back to me?  [_C._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.   [_L.C._]  Yes, dear, these wicked women get our husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of course.  And don?t make scenes, men hate them!  LADY WINDERMERE.  It is very kind of you, Duchess, to come and tell me all this.  But I can?t believe that my husband is untrue to me.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Pretty child!  I was like that once.  Now I know that all men are monsters.  [LADY WINDERMERE _rings bell_.]  The only thing to do is to feed the wretches well.  A good cook does wonders, and that I know you have.  My dear Margaret, you are not going to cry?  LADY WINDERMERE.  You needn?t be afraid, Duchess, I never cry.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  That's quite right, dear.  Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.  Agatha, darling!  LADY AGATHA.  [_Entering L._]  Yes, mamma.  [_Stands back of table L.C._]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, and thank her for your charming visit.  [_Coming down again_.]  And by the way, I must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper?he's that rich young Australian people are taking such notice of just at present.  His father made a great fortune by selling some kind of food in circular tins?most palatable, I believe?I fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse to eat.  But the son is quite interesting.  I think he's attracted by dear Agatha's clever talk.  Of course, we should be very sorry to lose her, but I think that a mother who doesn?t part with a daughter every season has no real affection.  We?re coming to-night, dear.  [PARKER _opens C. doors_.]  And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of town at once, it is the only thing to do.  Good-bye, once more; come, Agatha.                                   [_Exeunt_ DUCHESS _and_ LADY AGATHA _C._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  How horrible!  I understand now what Lord Darlington meant by the imaginary instance of the couple not two years married.  Oh! it can?t be true'she spoke of enormous sums of money paid to this woman. I know where Arthur keeps his bank book?in one of the drawers of that desk.  I might find out by that.  I _will_ find out.  [_Opens drawer_.] No, it is some hideous mistake.  [_Rises and goes C._]  Some silly scandal!  He loves _me_!  He loves _me_!  But why should I not look?  I am his wife, I have a right to look!  [_Returns to bureau_, _takes out book and examines it page by page_, _smiles and gives a sigh of relief_.] I knew it! there is not a word of truth in this stupid story.  [_Puts book back in dranver_.  _As the does so_, _starts and takes out another book_.]  A second book?private?locked!  [_Tries to open it_, _but fails_. _Sees paper knife on bureau_, _and with it cuts cover from book_. _Begins to start at the first page_.]  ?Mrs. Erlynne??600?Mrs. Erlynne??700?Mrs. Erlynne??400.?  Oh! it is true!  It is true!  How horrible!  [_Throws book on floor_.]                                              [_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE _C._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Well, dear, has the fan been sent home yet?  [_Going R.C._  _Sees book_.]  Margaret, you have cut open my bank book.  You have no right to do such a thing!  LADY WINDERMERE.  You think it wrong that you are found out, don?t you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  I think it wrong that a wife should spy on her husband.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I did not spy on you.  I never knew of this woman's existence till half an hour ago.  Some one who pitied me was kind enough to tell me what every one in London knows already?your daily visits to Curzon Street, your mad infatuation, the monstrous sums of money you squander on this infamous woman!  [_Crossing L._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret! don?t talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne, you don?t know how unjust it is!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Turning to him_.]  You are very jealous of Mrs. Erlynne's honour.  I wish you had been as jealous of mine.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Your honour is untouched, Margaret.  You don?t think for a moment that?[_Puts book back into desk_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  I think that you spend your money strangely.  That is all.  Oh, don?t imagine I mind about the money.  As far as I am concerned, you may squander everything we have.  But what I _do_ mind is that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to love you, should pass from the love that is given to the love that is bought.  Oh, it's horrible!  [_Sits on sofa_.]  And it is I who feel degraded! _you_ don?t feel anything.  I feel stained, utterly stained.  You can?t realise how hideous the last six months seems to me now?every kiss you have given me is tainted in my memory.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Don?t say that, Margaret.  I never loved any one in the whole world but you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rises_.]  Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a house for her?  LORD WINDERMERE.  I did not take a house for her.  LADY WINDERMERE.  You gave her the money to do it, which is the same thing.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Is there a Mr. Erlynne?or is he a myth?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Her husband died many years ago.  She is alone in the world.  LADY WINDERMERE.  No relations?  [_A pause_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  None.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Rather curious, isn?t it?  [_L._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, I was saying to you?and I beg you to listen to me?that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has conducted herself well.  If years ago?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh!  [_Crossing R.C._]  I don?t want details about her life!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  I am not going to give you any details about her life.  I tell you simply this?Mrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.  She was well born, she had position'she lost everything?threw it away, if you like.  That makes it all the more bitter.  Misfortunes one can endure?they come from outside, they are accidents.  But to suffer for one's own faults?ah!?there is the sting of life.  It was twenty years ago, too.  She was little more than a girl then.  She had been a wife for even less time than you have.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I am not interested in her?and?you should not mention this woman and me in the same breath.  It is an error of taste. [_Sitting R. at desk_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, you could save this woman.  She wants to get back into society, and she wants you to help her.  [_Crossing to her_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Me!  LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes, you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  How impertinent of her!  [_A pause_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, I came to ask you a great favour, and I still ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intended you should never have known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a large sum of money.  I want you to send her an invitation for our party to-night.  [_Standing L. of her_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  You are mad!  [_Rises_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  I entreat you.  People may chatter about her, do chatter about her, of course, but they don?t know anything definite against her.  She has been to several houses?not to houses where you would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are in what is called Society nowadays do go.  That does not content her.  She wants you to receive her once.  LADY WINDERMERE.  As a triumph for her, I suppose?  LORD WINDERMERE.  No; but because she knows that you are a good woman?and that if she comes here once she will have a chance of a happier, a surer life than she has had.  She will make no further effort to know you. Won?t you help a woman who is trying to get back?  LADY WINDERMERE.  No!  If a woman really repents, she never wishes to return to the society that has made or seen her ruin.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I beg of you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to door R._]  I am going to dress for dinner, and don?t mention the subject again this evening.  Arthur [_going to him C._], you fancy because I have no father or mother that I am alone in the world, and that you can treat me as you choose.  You are wrong, I have friends, many friends.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_L.C._]  Margaret, you are talking foolishly, recklessly.  I won?t argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs. Erlynne to-night.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_R.C._]  I shall do nothing of the kind.  [_Crossing L.C._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  You refuse?  [_C._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Absolutely!  LORD WINDERMERE.  Ah, Margaret, do this for my sake; it is her last chance.  LADY WINDERMERE.  What has that to do with me?  LORD WINDERMERE.  How hard good women are!  LADY WINDERMERE.  How weak bad men are!  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, none of us men may be good enough for the women we marry?that is quite true?but you don?t imagine I would ever?oh, the suggestion is monstrous!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why should _you_ be different from other men?  I am told that there is hardly a husband in London who does not waste his life over _some_ shameful passion.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I am not one of them.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I am not sure of that!  LORD WINDERMERE.  You are sure in your heart.  But don?t make chasm after chasm between us.  God knows the last few minutes have thrust us wide enough apart.  Sit down and write the card.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Nothing in the whole world would induce me.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to bureau_.]  Then I will!  [_Rings electric bell_, _sits and writes card_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  You are going to invite this woman?  [_Crossing to him_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes.  [_Pause_.  _Enter_ PARKER.]  Parker!  PARKER.  Yes, my lord.  [_Comes down L.C._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Have this note sent to Mrs. Erlynne at No. 84A Curzon Street.  [_Crossing to L.C. and giving note to_ PARKER.]  There is no answer!                                                        [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur, if that woman comes here, I shall insult her.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, don?t say that.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I mean it.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Child, if you did such a thing, there's not a woman in London who wouldn?t pity you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  There is not a _good_ woman in London who would not applaud me.  We have been too lax.  We must make an example.  I propose to begin to-night.  [_Picking up fan_.]  Yes, you gave me this fan to-day; it was your birthday present.  If that woman crosses my threshold, I shall strike her across the face with it.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, you couldn?t do such a thing.  LADY WINDERMERE.  You don?t know me!  [_Moves R._]  [_Enter_ PARKER.]  Parker!  PARKER.  Yes, my lady.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I shall dine in my own room.  I don?t want dinner, in fact.  See that everything is ready by half-past ten.  And, Parker, be sure you pronounce the names of the guests very distinctly to-night. Sometimes you speak so fast that I miss them.  I am particularly anxious to hear the names quite clearly, so as to make no mistake.  You understand, Parker?  PARKER.  Yes, my lady.  LADY WINDERMERE.  That will do!                                                        [_Exit_ PARKER _C._]  [_Speaking to_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  Arthur, if that woman comes here?I warn you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, you?ll ruin us!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Us!  From this moment my life is separate from yours. But if you wish to avoid a public scandal, write at once to this woman, and tell her that I forbid her to come here!  LORD WINDERMERE.  I will not?I cannot'she must come!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Then I shall do exactly as I have said.  [_Goes R._] You leave me no choice.                                                                 [_Exit R._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Calling after her_.]  Margaret!  Margaret!  [_A pause_.]  My God!  What shall I do?  I dare not tell her who this woman really is.  The shame would kill her.

DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Up C._]  So strange Lord Windermere isn?t here. Mr. Hopper is very late, too.  You have kept those five dances for him, Agatha?  [_Comes down_.]  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Sitting on sofa_.]  Just let me see your card. I?m so glad Lady Windermere has revived cards.?They?re a mother's only safeguard.  You dear simple little thing!  [_Scratches out two names_.] No nice girl should ever waltz with such particularly younger sons!  It looks so fast!  The last two dances you might pass on the terrace with Mr. Hopper.  [_Enter_ MR. DUMBY _and_ LADY PLYMDALE _from the ball-room_.]  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Fanning herself_.]  The air is so pleasant there.  PARKER.  Mrs. Cowper-Cowper.  Lady Stutfield.  Sir James Royston.  Mr. Guy Berkeley.  [_These people enter as announced_.]  DUMBY.  Good evening, Lady Stutfield.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?  LADY STUTFIELD.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It's been a delightful season, hasn?t it?  DUMBY.  Quite delightful!  Good evening, Duchess.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I suppose so, Mr. Dumby.  It has been a very dull season, hasn?t it?  DUMBY.  Dreadfully dull!  Dreadfully dull!  MR. COWPER-COWPER.  Good evening, Mr. Dumby.  I suppose this will be the last ball of the season?  DUMBY.  Oh, I think not.  There?ll probably be two more.  [_Wanders back to_ LADY PLYMDALE.]  PARKER.  Mr. Rufford.  Lady Jedburgh and Miss Graham.  Mr. Hopper.  [_These people enter as announced_.]  HOPPER.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  How do you do, Duchess?  [_Bows to_ LADY AGATHA.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Mr. Hopper, how nice of you to come so early. We all know how you are run after in London.  HOPPER.  Capital place, London!  They are not nearly so exclusive in London as they are in Sydney.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper.  We wish there were more like you.  It would make life so much easier.  Do you know, Mr. Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.  It must be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.  Agatha has found it on the map.  What a curious shape it is!  Just like a large packing case.  However, it is a very young country, isn?t it?  HOPPER.  Wasn?t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  How clever you are, Mr. Hopper.  You have a cleverness quite of your own.  Now I mustn?t keep you.  HOPPER.  But I should like to dance with Lady Agatha, Duchess.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Well, I hope she has a dance left.  Have you a dance left, Agatha?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  The next one?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  HOPPER.  May I have the pleasure?  [LADY AGATHA _bows_.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Mind you take great care of my little chatterbox, Mr. Hopper.  [LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _pass into ball-room_.]  [_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Margaret, I want to speak to you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  In a moment.  [_The music drops_.]  PARKER.  Lord Augustus Lorton.  [_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Good evening, Lady Windermere.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Sir James, will you take me into the ball-room? Augustus has been dining with us to-night.  I really have had quite enough of dear Augustus for the moment.  [SIR JAMES ROYSTON _gives the_ DUCHESS _his aim and escorts her into the ball-room_.]  PARKER.  Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bowden.  Lord and Lady Paisley.  Lord Darlington.  [_These people enter as announced_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Coming up to_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  Want to speak to you particularly, dear boy.  I?m worn to a shadow.  Know I don?t look it. None of us men do look what we really are.  Demmed good thing, too.  What I want to know is this.  Who is she?  Where does she come from?  Why hasn?t she got any demmed relations?  Demmed nuisance, relations!  But they make one so demmed respectable.  LORD WINDERMERE.  You are talking of Mrs. Erlynne, I suppose?  I only met her six months ago.  Till then, I never knew of her existence.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  You have seen a good deal of her since then.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Coldly_.]  Yes, I have seen a good deal of her since then.  I have just seen her.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Egad! the women are very down on her.  I have been dining with Arabella this evening!  By Jove! you should have heard what she said about Mrs. Erlynne.  She didn?t leave a rag on her. . . . [_Aside_.] Berwick and I told her that didn?t matter much, as the lady in question must have an extremely fine figure.  You should have seen Arabella's expression! . . . But, look here, dear boy.  I don?t know what to do about Mrs. Erlynne.  Egad!  I might be married to her; she treats me with such demmed indifference.  She's deuced clever, too!  She explains everything.  Egad! she explains you.  She has got any amount of explanations for you?and all of them different.  LORD WINDERMERE.  No explanations are necessary about my friendship with Mrs. Erlynne.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Hem!  Well, look here, dear old fellow.  Do you think she will ever get into this demmed thing called Society?  Would you introduce her to your wife?  No use beating about the confounded bush.  Would you do that?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here to-night.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Your wife has sent her a card?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne has received a card.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Then she's all right, dear boy.  But why didn?t you tell me that before?  It would have saved me a heap of worry and demmed misunderstandings!  [LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _cross and exit on terrace L.U.E._]  PARKER.  Mr. Cecil Graham!  [_Enter_ MR. CECIL GRAHAM.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_Bows to_ LADY WINDERMERE, _passes over and shakes hands with_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  Good evening, Arthur.  Why don?t you ask me how I am?  I like people to ask me how I am.  It shows a wide-spread interest in my health.  Now, to-night I am not at all well.  Been dining with my people.  Wonder why it is one's people are always so tedious?  My father would talk morality after dinner.  I told him he was old enough to know better.  But my experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better, they don?t know anything at all.  Hallo, Tuppy!  Hear you?re going to be married again; thought you were tired of that game.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  You?re excessively trivial, my dear boy, excessively trivial!  CECIL GRAHAM.  By the way, Tuppy, which is it?  Have you been twice married and once divorced, or twice divorced and once married?  I say you?ve been twice divorced and once married.  It seems so much more probable.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  I have a very bad memory.  I really don?t remember which. [_Moves away R._]  LADY PLYMDALE.  Lord Windermere, I?ve something most particular to ask you.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I am afraid?if you will excuse me?I must join my wife.  LADY PLYMDALE.  Oh, you mustn?t dream of such a thing.  It's most dangerous nowadays for a husband to pay any attention to his wife in public.  It always makes people think that he beats her when they?re alone.  The world has grown so suspicious of anything that looks like a happy married life.  But I?ll tell you what it is at supper.  [_Moves towards door of ball-room_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  Margaret!  I _must_ speak to you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Will you hold my fan for me, Lord Darlington?  Thanks. [_Comes down to him_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Margaret, what you said before dinner was, of course, impossible?  LADY WINDERMERE.  That woman is not coming here to-night!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_R.C._]  Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both. Remember that!  Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her husband!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_C._]  London is full of women who trust their husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly unhappy.  I am not going to be one of them.  [_Moves up_.]  Lord Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful thing a fan, isn?t it? . . . I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I didn?t know I would want one so soon.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Lady Windermere!  I knew the time would come some day; but why to-night?  LORD WINDERMERE|2
93|.  I _will_ tell her.  I must.  It would be terrible if there were any scene.  Margaret . . .  PARKER.  Mrs. Erlynne!  [LORD WINDERMERE _starts_.  MRS. ERLYNNE _enters_, _very beautifully dressed and very dignified_.  LADY WINDERMERE _clutches at her fan_, _then lets it drop on the door_.  _She bows coldly to_ MRS. ERLYNNE, _who bows to her sweetly in turn_, _and sails into the room_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  You have dropped your fan, Lady Windermere.  [_Picks it up and hands it to her_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._]  How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_In a low voice_.]  It was terribly rash of you to come!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Smiling_.]  The wisest thing I ever did in my life. And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening. I am afraid of the women.  You must introduce me to some of them.  The men I can always manage.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  You have quite neglected me lately.  I have not seen you since yesterday.  I am afraid you?re faithless.  Every one told me so.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_R._]  Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_R.C._]  No, dear Lord Augustus, you can?t explain anything.  It is your chief charm.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Ah! if you find charms in me, Mrs. Erlynne?  [_They converse together_.  LORD WINDERMERE _moves uneasily about the room watching_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_To_ LADY WINDERMERE.]  How pale you are!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Cowards are always pale!  LORD DARLINGTON.  You look faint.  Come out on the terrace.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  [_To_ PARKER.]  Parker, send my cloak out.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Crossing to her_.]  Lady Windermere, how beautifully your terrace is illuminated.  Reminds me of Prince Doria's at Rome.  [LADY WINDERMERE _bows coldly_, _and goes off with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Oh, how do you do, Mr. Graham?  Isn?t that your aunt, Lady Jedburgh?  I should so much like to know her.  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_After a moment's hesitation and embarrassment_.]  Oh, certainly, if you wish it.  Aunt Caroline, allow me to introduce Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  So pleased to meet you, Lady Jedburgh.  [_Sits beside her on the sofa_.]  Your nephew and I are great friends.  I am so much interested in his political career.  I think he's sure to be a wonderful success.  He thinks like a Tory, and talks like a Radical, and that's so important nowadays.  He's such a brilliant talker, too.  But we all know from whom he inherits that.  Lord Allandale was saying to me only yesterday, in the Park, that Mr. Graham talks almost as well as his aunt.  LADY JEDBURGH.  [_R._]  Most kind of you to say these charming things to me!  [MRS. ERLYNNE _smiles_, _and continues conversation_.]  DUMBY.  [_To_ CECIL GRAHAM.]  Did you introduce Mrs. Erlynne to Lady Jedburgh?  CECIL GRAHAM.  Had to, my dear fellow.  Couldn?t help it!  That woman can make one do anything she wants.  How, I don?t know.  DUMBY.  Hope to goodness she won?t speak to me!  [_Saunters towards_ LADY PLYMDALE.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._  _To_ LADY JEDBURGH.]  On Thursday?  With great pleasure.  [_Rises_, _and speaks to_ LORD WINDERMERE, _laughing_.]  What a bore it is to have to be civil to these old dowagers!  But they always insist on it!  LADY PLYMDALE.  [_To_ MR. DUMBY.]  Who is that well-dressed woman talking to Windermere?  DUMBY.  Haven?t got the slightest idea!  Looks like an _?dition de luxe_ of a wicked French novel, meant specially for the English market.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  So that is poor Dumby with Lady Plymdale?  I hear she is frightfully jealous of him.  He doesn?t seem anxious to speak to me to-night.  I suppose he is afraid of her.  Those straw-coloured women have dreadful tempers.  Do you know, I think I?ll dance with you first, Windermere.  [LORD WINDERMERE _bits his lip and frowns_.]  It will make Lord Augustus so jealous!  Lord Augustus!  [LORD AUGUSTUS _comes down_.] Lord Windermere insists on my dancing with him first, and, as it's his own house, I can?t well refuse.  You know I would much sooner dance with you.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_With a low bow_.]  I wish I could think so, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You know it far too well.  I can fancy a person dancing through life with you and finding it charming.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Placing his hand on his white waistcoat_.]  Oh, thank you, thank you.  You are the most adorable of all ladies!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  What a nice speech!  So simple and so sincere!  Just the sort of speech I like.  Well, you shall hold my bouquet.  [_Goes towards ball-room on_ LORD WINDERMERE?S _arm_.]  Ah, Mr. Dumby, how are you?  I am so sorry I have been out the last three times you have called.  Come and lunch on Friday.  DUMBY.  [_With perfect nonchalance_.]  Delighted!  [LADY PLYMDALE _glares with indignation at_ MR. DUMBY.  LORD AUGUSTUS _follows_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and_ LORD WINDERMERE _into the ball-room holding bouquet_.]  LADY PLYMDALE.  [_To_ MR. DUMBY.]  What an absolute brute you are!  I never can believe a word you say!  Why did you tell me you didn?t know her?  What do you mean by calling on her three times running?  You are not to go to lunch there; of course you understand that?  DUMBY.  My dear Laura, I wouldn?t dream of going!  LADY PLYMDALE.  You haven?t told me her name yet!  Who is she?  DUMBY.  [_Coughs slightly and smooths his hair_.]  She's a Mrs. Erlynne.  LADY PLYMDALE.  That woman!  DUMBY.  Yes; that is what every one calls her.  LADY PLYMDALE.  How very interesting!  How intensely interesting!  I really must have a good stare at her.  [_Goes to door of ball-room and looks in_.]  I have heard the most shocking things about her.  They say she is ruining poor Windermere.  And Lady Windermere, who goes in for being so proper, invites her!  How extremely amusing!  It takes a thoroughly good woman to do a thoroughly stupid thing.  You are to lunch there on Friday!  DUMBY.  Why?  LADY PLYMDALE.  Because I want you to take my husband with you.  He has been so attentive lately, that he has become a perfect nuisance.  Now, this woman is just the thing for him.  He?ll dance attendance upon her as long as she lets him, and won?t bother me.  I assure you, women of that kind are most useful.  They form the basis of other people's marriages.  DUMBY.  What a mystery you are!  LADY PLYMDALE.  [_Looking at him_.]  I wish _you_ were!  DUMBY.  I am?to myself.  I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly; but I don?t see any chance of it just at present.  [_They pass into the ball-room_, _and_ LADY WINDERMERE _and_ LORD DARLINGTON _enter from the terrace_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Her coming here is monstrous, unbearable.  I know now what you meant to-day at tea-time.  Why didn?t you tell me right out? You should have!  LORD DARLINGTON.  I couldn?t!  A man can?t tell these things about another man!  But if I had known he was going to make you ask her here to-night, I think I would have told you.  That insult, at any rate, you would have been spared.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I did not ask her.  He insisted on her coming?against my entreaties?against my commands.  Oh! the house is tainted for me!  I feel that every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband. What have I done to deserve this?  I gave him all my life.  He took it?used it'spoiled it!  I am degraded in my own eyes; and I lack courage?I am a coward!  [_Sits down on sofa_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  If I know you at all, I know that you can?t live with a man who treats you like this!  What sort of life would you have with him? You would feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day.  You would feel that the look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his touch false, his passion false.  He would come to you when he was weary of others; you would have to comfort him.  He would come to you when he was devoted to others; you would have to charm him.  You would have to be to him the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his secret.  LADY WINDERMERE.  You are right?you are terribly right.  But where am I to turn?  You said you would be my friend, Lord Darlington.?Tell me, what am I to do?  Be my friend now.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship.  I love you?  LADY WINDERMERE.  No, no!  [_Rises_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  Yes, I love you!  You are more to me than anything in the whole world.  What does your husband give you?  Nothing.  Whatever is in him he gives to this wretched woman, whom he has thrust into your society, into your home, to shame you before every one.  I offer you my life?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington!  LORD DARLINGTON.  My life?my whole life.  Take it, and do with it what you will. . . . I love you?love you as I have never loved any living thing.  From the moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly, madly!  You did not know it then?you know it now!  Leave this house to-night.  I won?t tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice, or the voice of society.  They matter a great deal.  They matter far too much.  But there are moments when one has to choose between living one's own life, fully, entirely, completely?or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.  You have that moment now.  Choose!  Oh, my love, choose.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Moving slowly away from him_, _and looking at him with startled eyes_.]  I have not the courage.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Following her_.]  Yes; you have the courage.  There may be six months of pain, of disgrace even, but when you no longer bear his name, when you bear mine, all will be well.  Margaret, my love, my wife that shall be some day?yes, my wife!  You know it!  What are you now?  This woman has the place that belongs by right to you.  Oh! go?go out of this house, with head erect, with a smile upon your lips, with courage in your eyes.  All London will know why you did it; and who will blame you?  No one.  If they do, what matter?  Wrong?  What is wrong? It's wrong for a man to abandon his wife for a shameless woman.  It is wrong for a wife to remain with a man who so dishonours her.  You said once you would make no compromise with things.  Make none now.  Be brave! Be yourself!  LADY WINDERMERE.  I am afraid of being myself.  Let me think!  Let me wait!  My husband may return to me.  [_Sits down on sofa_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  And you would take him back!  You are not what I thought you were.  You are just the same as every other woman.  You would stand anything rather than face the censure of a world, whose praise you would despise.  In a week you will be driving with this woman in the Park.  She will be your constant guest?your dearest friend.  You would endure anything rather than break with one blow this monstrous tie.  You are right.  You have no courage; none!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Ah, give me time to think.  I cannot answer you now. [_Passes her hand nervously over her brow_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  It must be now or not at all.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising from the sofa_.]  Then, not at all!  [_A pause_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  You break my heart!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Mine is already broken.  [_A pause_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  To-morrow I leave England.  This is the last time I shall ever look on you.  You will never see me again.  For one moment our lives met?our souls touched.  They must never meet or touch again. Good-bye, Margaret.  [_Exit_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  How alone I am in life!  How terribly alone!  [_The music stops_.  _Enter the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK _and_ LORD PAISLEY _laughing and talking_.  _Other guests come on from ball-room_.]  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Dear Margaret, I?ve just been having such a delightful chat with Mrs. Erlynne.  I am so sorry for what I said to you this afternoon about her.  Of course, she must be all right if _you_ invite her.  A most attractive woman, and has such sensible views on life.  Told me she entirely disapproved of people marrying more than once, so I feel quite safe about poor Augustus.  Can?t imagine why people speak against her.  It's those horrid nieces of mine?the Saville girls?they?re always talking scandal.  Still, I should go to Homburg, dear, I really should.  She is just a little too attractive.  But where is Agatha?  Oh, there she is:  [LADY AGATHA _and_ MR. HOPPER _enter from terrace L.U.E._]  Mr. Hopper, I am very, very angry with you.  You have taken Agatha out on the terrace, and she is so delicate.  HOPPER.  Awfully sorry, Duchess.  We went out for a moment and then got chatting together.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_C._]  Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?  HOPPER.  Yes!  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Agatha, darling!  [_Beckons her over_.]  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma!  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Aside_.]  Did Mr. Hopper definitely?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  And what answer did you give him, dear child?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Affectionately_.]  My dear one!  You always say the right thing.  Mr. Hopper!  James!  Agatha has told me everything. How cleverly you have both kept your secret.  HOPPER.  You don?t mind my taking Agatha off to Australia, then, Duchess?  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Indignantly_.]  To Australia?  Oh, don?t mention that dreadful vulgar place.  HOPPER.  But she said she?d like to come with me.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  [_Severely_.]  Did you say that, Agatha?  LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.  I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more healthy place to reside in.  There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about.  But we?ll talk about that to-morrow.  James, you can take Agatha down.  You?ll come to lunch, of course, James.  At half-past one, instead of two.  The Duke will wish to say a few words to you, I am sure.  HOPPER.  I should like to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess.  He has not said a single word to me yet.  DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  I think you?ll find he will have a great deal to say to you to-morrow.  [_Exit_ LADY AGATHA _with_ MR. HOPPER.]  And now good-night, Margaret.  I?m afraid it's the old, old story, dear. Love?well, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season, which is so much more satisfactory.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Good-night, Duchess.  [_Exit the_ DUCHESS OF BERWICK _on_ LORD PAISLEY?S _arm_.]  LADY PLYMDALE.  My dear Margaret, what a handsome woman your husband has been dancing with!  I should be quite jealous if I were you!  Is she a great friend of yours?  LADY WINDERMERE.  No!  LADY PLYMDALE.  Really?  Good-night, dear.  [_Looks at_ MR. DUMBY _and exit_.]  DUMBY.  Awful manners young Hopper has!  CECIL GRAHAM.  Ah!  Hopper is one of Nature's gentlemen, the worst type of gentleman I know.  DUMBY.  Sensible woman, Lady Windermere.  Lots of wives would have objected to Mrs. Erlynne coming.  But Lady Windermere has that uncommon thing called common sense.  CECIL GRAHAM.  And Windermere knows that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion.  DUMBY.  Yes; dear Windermere is becoming almost modern.  Never thought he would.  [_Bows to_ LADY WINDERMERE _and exit_.]  LADY JEDBURGH.  Good night, Lady Windermere.  What a fascinating woman Mrs. Erlynne is!  She is coming to lunch on Thursday, won?t you come too? I expect the Bishop and dear Lady Merton.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I am afraid I am engaged, Lady Jedburgh.  LADY JEDBURGH.  So sorry.  Come, dear.  [_Exeunt_ LADY JEDBURGH _and_ MISS GRAHAM.]  [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Charming ball it has been!  Quite reminds me of old days. [_Sits on sofa_.]  And I see that there are just as many fools in society as there used to be.  So pleased to find that nothing has altered! Except Margaret.  She's grown quite pretty.  The last time I saw her?twenty years ago, she was a fright in flannel.  Positive fright, I assure you.  The dear Duchess! and that sweet Lady Agatha!  Just the type of girl I like!  Well, really, Windermere, if I am to be the Duchess's sister-in-law?  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Sitting L. of her_.]  But are you??  [_Exit_ MR. CECIL GRAHAM _with rest of guests_.  LADY WINDERMERE _watches_, _with a look of scorn and pain_, MRS. ERLYNNE _and her husband_.  _They are unconscious of her presence_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh, yes!  He's to call to-morrow at twelve o?clock!  He wanted to propose to-night.  In fact he did.  He kept on proposing.  Poor Augustus, you know how he repeats himself.  Such a bad habit!  But I told him I wouldn?t give him an answer till to-morrow.  Of course I am going to take him.  And I dare say I?ll make him an admirable wife, as wives go.  And there is a great deal of good in Lord Augustus.  Fortunately it is all on the surface.  Just where good qualities should be.  Of course you must help me in this matter.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I am not called on to encourage Lord Augustus, I suppose?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh, no!  I do the encouraging.  But you will make me a handsome settlement, Windermere, won?t you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Frowning_.]  Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_With a gesture of impatience_.]  I will not talk of it here.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Laughing_.]  Then we will talk of it on the terrace. Even business should have a picturesque background.  Should it not, Windermere?  With a proper background women can do anything.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Won?t to-morrow do as well?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  No; you see, to-morrow I am going to accept him.  And I think it would be a good thing if I was able to tell him that I had?well, what shall I say???2000 a year left to me by a third cousin?or a second husband?or some distant relative of that kind.  It would be an additional attraction, wouldn?t it?  You have a delightful opportunity now of paying me a compliment, Windermere.  But you are not very clever at paying compliments.  I am afraid Margaret doesn?t encourage you in that excellent habit.  It's a great mistake on her part.  When men give up saying what is charming, they give up thinking what is charming.  But seriously, what do you say to ?2000?  ?2500, I think.  In modern life margin is everything.  Windermere, don?t you think the world an intensely amusing place?  I do!  [_Exit on terrace with_ LORD WINDERMERE.  Music strikes up in ball-room.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  To stay in this house any longer is impossible. To-night a man who loves me offered me his whole life.  I refused it.  It was foolish of me.  I will offer him mine now.  I will give him mine.  I will go to him!  [_Puts on cloak and goes to the door_, _then turns back_.  _Sits down at table and writes a letter_, _puts it into an envelope_, _and leaves it on table_.]  Arthur has never understood me. When he reads this, he will.  He may do as he chooses now with his life. I have done with mine as I think best, as I think right.  It is he who has broken the bond of marriage?not I.  I only break its bondage.                                                                   [_Exit_.]  [_PARKER enters L. and crosses towards the ball-room R._  _Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Is Lady Windermere in the ball-room?  PARKER.  Her ladyship has just gone out.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Gone out?  She's not on the terrace?  PARKER.  No, madam.  Her ladyship has just gone out of the house.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Starts_, _and looks at the servant with a puzzled expression in her face_.]  Out of the house?  PARKER.  Yes, madam?her ladyship told me she had left a letter for his lordship on the table.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  A letter for Lord Windermere?  PARKER.  Yes, madam.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thank you.  [_Exit_ PARKER.  _The music in the ball-room stops_.]  Gone out of her house!  A letter addressed to her husband!  [_Goes over to bureau and looks at letter_.  _Takes it up and lays it down again with a shudder of fear_.]  No, no!  It would be impossible!  Life doesn?t repeat its tragedies like that!  Oh, why does this horrible fancy come across me? Why do I remember now the one moment of my life I most wish to forget? Does life repeat its tragedies?  [_Tears letter open and reads it_, _then sinks down into a chair with a gesture of anguish_.]  Oh, how terrible! The same words that twenty years ago I wrote to her father! and how bitterly I have been punished for it!  No; my punishment, my real punishment is to-night, is now!  [_Still seated R._]  [_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE _L.U.E._]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Have you said good-night to my wife?  [_Comes C._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Crushing letter in her hand_.]  Yes.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Where is she?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  She is very tired.  She has gone to bed.  She said she had a headache.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I must go to her.  You?ll excuse me?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Rising hurriedly_.]  Oh, no!  It's nothing serious. She's only very tired, that is all.  Besides, there are people still in the supper-room.  She wants you to make her apologies to them.  She said she didn?t wish to be disturbed.  [_Drops letter_.]  She asked me to tell you!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Picks up letter_.]  You have dropped something.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh yes, thank you, that is mine.  [_Puts out her hand to take it_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Still looking at letter_.]  But it's my wife's handwriting, isn?t it?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Takes the letter quickly_.]  Yes, it's?an address.  Will you ask them to call my carriage, please?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Certainly.                                                       [_Goes L. and Exit_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thanks!  What can I do?  What can I do?  I feel a passion awakening within me that I never felt before.  What can it mean?  The daughter must not be like the mother?that would be terrible.  How can I save her?  How can I save my child?  A moment may ruin a life.  Who knows that better than I?  Windermere must be got out of the house; that is absolutely necessary.  [_Goes L._]  But how shall I do it?  It must be done somehow.  Ah!  [_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS _R.U.E. carrying bouquet_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Dear lady, I am in such suspense!  May I not have an answer to my request?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lord Augustus, listen to me.  You are to take Lord Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as possible.  You understand?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  But you said you wished me to keep early hours!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Nervously_.]  Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  And my reward?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Your reward?  Your reward?  Oh! ask me that to-morrow. But don?t let Windermere out of your sight to-night.  If you do I will never forgive you.  I will never speak to you again.  I?ll have nothing to do with you.  Remember you are to keep Windermere at your club, and don?t let him come back to-night.                                                                 [_Exit L._]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Well, really, I might be her husband already.  Positively I might.  [_Follows her in a bewildered manner_.]                                  * * * * *                                  ACT DROP.

Table C. with syphons, glasses, and Tantalus frame_.  _Table L. with cigar and cigarette box. Lamps lit_.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Standing by the fireplace_.]  Why doesn?t he come? This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to wake by passionate words some fire within me?  I am cold?cold as a loveless thing.  Arthur must have read my letter by this time.  If he cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by force.  But he doesn?t care.  He's entrammelled by this woman?fascinated by her?dominated by her.  If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely to appeal to what is worst in him.  We make gods of men and they leave us.  Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  How hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad. And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who loves one, or the wife of a man who in one's own house dishonours one? What woman knows?  What woman in the whole world?  But will he love me always, this man to whom I am giving my life?  What do I bring him?  Lips that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill hands and icy heart.  I bring him nothing.  I must go back?no; I can?t go back, my letter has put me in their power?Arthur would not take me back! That fatal letter!  No!  Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow.  I will go with him?I have no choice.  [_Sits down for a few moments_. _Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.]  No, no!  I will go back, let Arthur do with me what he pleases.  I can?t wait here.  It has been madness my coming.  I must go at once.  As for Lord Darlington?Oh! here he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away at all?  I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh!  [_Hides her face in her hands_.]  [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _L._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lady Windermere!  [LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_. _Then recoils in contempt_.]  Thank Heaven I am in time.  You must go back to your husband's house immediately.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Must?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Authoritatively_.]  Yes, you must!  There is not a second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Don?t come near me!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh!  You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of a hideous precipice.  You must leave this place at once, my carriage is waiting at the corner of the street.  You must come with me and drive straight home.  [LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]  What are you doing?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne?if you had not come here, I would have gone back.  But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere. You fill me with horror.  There is something about you that stirs the wildest?rage within me.  And I know why you are here.  My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist between you and him.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh!  You don?t think that?you can?t.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.  He belongs to you and not to me.  I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.  Men are such cowards.  They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the world's tongue.  But he had better prepare himself.  He shall have a scandal.  He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for years.  He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous placard.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  No?no?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for me?I was going back?but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his messenger?oh! it was infamous?infamous.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_C._]  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly?you wrong your husband horribly.  He doesn?t know you are here?he thinks you are safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He never read the mad letter you wrote to him!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_R._]  Never read it!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  No?he knows nothing about it.  LADY WINDERMERE.  How simple you think me!  [_Going to her_.]  You are lying to me!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Restraining herself_.]  I am not.  I am telling you the truth.  LADY WINDERMERE.  If my husband didn?t read my letter, how is it that you are here?  Who told you I had left the house you were shameless enough to enter?  Who told you where I had gone to?  My husband told you, and sent you to decoy me back.  [_Crosses L._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_R.C._]  Your husband has never seen the letter.  I'saw it, I opened it.  I?read it.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Turning to her_.]  You opened a letter of mine to my husband?  You wouldn?t dare!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Dare!  Oh! to save you from the abyss into which you are falling, there is nothing in the world I would not dare, nothing in the whole world.  Here is the letter.  Your husband has never read it.  He never shall read it.  [_Going to fireplace_.]  It should never have been written.  [_Tears it and throws it into the fire_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_With infinite contempt in her voice and look_.]  Ho|2
94|w do I know that that was my letter after all?  You seem to think the commonest device can take me in!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh! why do you disbelieve everything I tell you?  What object do you think I have in coming here, except to save you from utter ruin, to save you from the consequence of a hideous mistake?  That letter that is burnt now _was_ your letter.  I swear it to you!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Slowly_.]  You took good care to burn it before I had examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could you speak the truth about anything?  [_Sits down_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Hurriedly_.]  Think as you like about me'say what you choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Sullenly_.]  I do _not_ love him!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You do, and you know that he loves you.  LADY WINDERMERE.  He does not understand what love is.  He understands it as little as you do?but I see what you want.  It would be a great advantage for you to get me back.  Dear Heaven! what a life I would have then!  Living at the mercy of a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in her, a woman whom it is an infamy to meet, a degradation to know, a vile woman, a woman who comes between husband and wife!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With a gesture of despair_.]  Lady Windermere, Lady Windermere, don?t say such terrible things.  You don?t know how terrible they are, how terrible and how unjust.  Listen, you must listen!  Only go back to your husband, and I promise you never to communicate with him again on any pretext?never to see him?never to have anything to do with his life or yours.  The money that he gave me, he gave me not through love, but through hatred, not in worship, but in contempt.  The hold I have over him?  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  Ah! you admit you have a hold!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes, and I will tell you what it is.  It is his love for you, Lady Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  You expect me to believe that?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You must believe it!  It is true.  It is his love for you that has made him submit to?oh! call it what you like, tyranny, threats, anything you choose.  But it is his love for you.  His desire to spare you'shame, yes, shame and disgrace.  LADY WINDERMERE.  What do you mean?  You are insolent!  What have I to do with you?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Humbly_.]  Nothing.  I know it?but I tell you that your husband loves you?that you may never meet with such love again in your whole life?that such love you will never meet?and that if you throw it away, the day may come when you will starve for love and it will not be given to you, beg for love and it will be denied you?Oh! Arthur loves you!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur?  And you tell me there is nothing between you?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lady Windermere, before Heaven your husband is guiltless of all offence towards you!  And I?I tell you that had it ever occurred to me that such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind, I would have died rather than have crossed your life or his?oh! died, gladly died!  [_Moves away to sofa R._]  LADY WINDERMERE.  You talk as if you had a heart.  Women like you have no hearts.  Heart is not in you.  You are bought and sold.  [_Sits L.C._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Starts_, _with a gesture of pain_.  _Then restrains herself_, _and comes over to where_ LADY WINDERMERE _is sitting_.  _As she speaks_, _she stretches out her hands towards her_, _but does not dare to touch her_.]  Believe what you choose about me.  I am not worth a moment's sorrow.  But don?t spoil your beautiful young life on my account!  You don?t know what may be in store for you, unless you leave this house at once.  You don?t know what it is to fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at?to be an outcast! to find the door shut against one, to have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from one's face, and all the while to hear the laughter, the horrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed.  You don?t know what it is.  One pays for one's sin, and then one pays again, and all one's life one pays.  You must never know that.?As for me, if suffering be an expiation, then at this moment I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have been; for to-night you have made a heart in one who had it not, made it and broken it.?But let that pass.  I may have wrecked my own life, but I will not let you wreck yours.  You?why, you are a mere girl, you would be lost.  You haven?t got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back.  You have neither the wit nor the courage.  You couldn?t stand dishonour!  No!  Go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who loves you, whom you love.  You have a child, Lady Windermere.  Go back to that child who even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling to you.  [LADY WINDERMERE _rises_.]  God gave you that child. He will require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over him.  What answer will you make to God if his life is ruined through you? Back to your house, Lady Windermere?your husband loves you!  He has never swerved for a moment from the love he bears you.  But even if he had a thousand loves, you must stay with your child.  If he was harsh to you, you must stay with your child.  If he ill-treated you, you must stay with your child.  If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.  [LADY WINDERMERE _bursts into tears and buries her face in her hands_.]  [_Rushing to her_.]  Lady Windermere!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Holding out her hands to her_, _helplessly_, _as a child might do_.]  Take me home.  Take me home.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Is about to embrace her_.  _Then restrains herself_. _There is a look of wonderful joy in her face_.]  Come!  Where is your cloak?  [_Getting it from sofa_.]  Here.  Put it on.  Come at once!  [_They go to the door_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Stop!  Don?t you hear voices?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  No, no!  There was no one!  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, there is!  Listen!  Oh! that is my husband's voice!  He is coming in!  Save me!  Oh, it's some plot!  You have sent for him.  [_Voices outside_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Silence!  I?m here to save you, if I can.  But I fear it is too late!  There! [_Points to the curtain across the window_.]  The first chance you have, slip out, if you ever get a chance!  LADY WINDERMERE.  But you?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh! never mind me.  I?ll face them.  [LADY WINDERMERE _hides herself behind the curtain_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Outside_.]  Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not leave me!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Lord Augustus!  Then it is I who am lost!  [_Hesitates for a moment_, then _looks round and sees door R._, _and exits through it_.]  [_Enter_ LORD DARLINGTON, MR. DUMBY, LORD WINDERMERE, LORD AUGUSTUS LORTON, _and_ MR. CECIL GRAHAM.  DUMBY.  What a nuisance their turning us out of the club at this hour! It's only two o?clock.  [_Sinks into a chair_.]  The lively part of the evening is only just beginning.  [_Yawns and closes his eyes_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  It is very good of you, Lord Darlington, allowing Augustus to force our company on you, but I?m afraid I can?t stay long.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Really!  I am so sorry!  You?ll take a cigar, won?t you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Thanks!  [_Sits down_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_To_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  My dear boy, you must not dream of going.  I have a great deal to talk to you about, of demmed importance, too.  [_Sits down with him at L. table_.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  Oh!  We all know what that is!  Tuppy can?t talk about anything but Mrs. Erlynne.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Well, that is no business of yours, is it, Cecil?  CECIL GRAHAM.  None!  That is why it interests me.  My own business always bores me to death.  I prefer other people's.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Have something to drink, you fellows.  Cecil, you?ll have a whisky and soda?  CECIL GRAHAM.  Thanks.  [_Goes to table with_ LORD DARLINGTON.]  Mrs. Erlynne looked very handsome to-night, didn?t she?  LORD DARLINGTON.  I am not one of her admirers.  CECIL GRAHAM.  I usen?t to be, but I am now.  Why! she actually made me introduce her to poor dear Aunt Caroline.  I believe she is going to lunch there.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_In Purple_.]  No?  CECIL GRAHAM.  She is, really.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Excuse me, you fellows.  I?m going away to-morrow.  And I have to write a few letters.  [_Goes to writing table and sits down_.]  DUMBY.  Clever woman, Mrs. Erlynne.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Hallo, Dumby!  I thought you were asleep.  DUMBY.  I am, I usually am!  LORD AUGUSTUS.  A very clever woman.  Knows perfectly well what a demmed fool I am?knows it as well as I do myself.  [CECIL GRAHAM _comes towards him laughing_.]  Ah, you may laugh, my boy, but it is a great thing to come across a woman who thoroughly understands one.  DUMBY.  It is an awfully dangerous thing.  They always end by marrying one.  CECIL GRAHAM.  But I thought, Tuppy, you were never going to see her again!  Yes! you told me so yesterday evening at the club.  You said you?d heard?  [_Whispering to him_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Oh, she's explained that.  CECIL GRAHAM.  And the Wiesbaden affair?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  She's explained that too.  DUMBY.  And her income, Tuppy?  Has she explained that?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_In a very serious voice_.]  She's going to explain that to-morrow.  [CECIL GRAHAM _goes back to C. table_.]  DUMBY.  Awfully commercial, women nowadays.  Our grandmothers threw their caps over the mills, of course, but, by Jove, their granddaughters only throw their caps over mills that can raise the wind for them.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  You want to make her out a wicked woman.  She is not!  CECIL GRAHAM.  Oh!  Wicked women bother one.  Good women bore one.  That is the only difference between them.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Puffing a cigar_.]  Mrs. Erlynne has a future before her.  DUMBY.  Mrs. Erlynne has a past before her.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  I prefer women with a past.  They?re always so demmed amusing to talk to.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Well, you?ll have lots of topics of conversation with _her_, Tuppy.  [_Rising and going to him_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  You?re getting annoying, dear-boy; you?re getting demmed annoying.  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_Puts his hands on his shoulders_.]  Now, Tuppy, you?ve lost your figure and you?ve lost your character.  Don?t lose your temper; you have only got one.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  My dear boy, if I wasn?t the most good-natured man in London?  CECIL GRAHAM.  We?d treat you with more respect, wouldn?t we, Tuppy? [_Strolls away_.]  DUMBY.  The youth of the present day are quite monstrous.  They have absolutely no respect for dyed hair.  [LORD AUGUSTUS _looks round angrily_.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  Mrs. Erlynne has a very great respect for dear Tuppy.  DUMBY.  Then Mrs. Erlynne sets an admirable example to the rest of her sex.  It is perfectly brutal the way most women nowadays behave to men who are not their husbands.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Dumby, you are ridiculous, and Cecil, you let your tongue run away with you.  You must leave Mrs. Erlynne alone.  You don?t really know anything about her, and you?re always talking scandal against her.  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_Coming towards him L.C._]  My dear Arthur, I never talk scandal.  _I_ only talk gossip.  LORD WINDERMERE.  What is the difference between scandal and gossip?  CECIL GRAHAM.  Oh! gossip is charming!  History is merely gossip.  But scandal is gossip made tedious by morality.  Now, I never moralise.  A man who moralises is usually a hypocrite, and a woman who moralises is invariably plain.  There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a Nonconformist conscience.  And most women know it, I?m glad to say.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Just my sentiments, dear boy, just my sentiments.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Sorry to hear it, Tuppy; whenever people agree with me, I always feel I must be wrong.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  My dear boy, when I was your age?  CECIL GRAHAM.  But you never were, Tuppy, and you never will be.  [_Goes up C._]  I say, Darlington, let us have some cards.  You?ll play, Arthur, won?t you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  No, thanks, Cecil.  DUMBY.  [_With a sigh_.]  Good heavens! how marriage ruins a man!  It's as demoralising as cigarettes, and far more expensive.  CECIL GRAHAM.  You?ll play, of course, Tuppy?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Pouring himself out a brandy and soda at table_.] Can?t, dear boy.  Promised Mrs. Erlynne never to play or drink again.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Now, my dear Tuppy, don?t be led astray into the paths of virtue.  Reformed, you would be perfectly tedious.  That is the worst of women.  They always want one to be good.  And if we are good, when they meet us, they don?t love us at all.  They like to find us quite irretrievably bad, and to leave us quite unattractively good.  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Rising from R. table_, _where he has been writing letters_.]  They always do find us bad!  DUMBY.  I don?t think we are bad.  I think we are all good, except Tuppy.  LORD DARLINGTON.  No, we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.  [_Sits down at C. table_.]  DUMBY.  We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars?  Upon my word, you are very romantic to-night, Darlington.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Too romantic!  You must be in love.  Who is the girl?  LORD DARLINGTON.  The woman I love is not free, or thinks she isn?t. [_Glances instinctively at_ LORD WINDERMERE _while he speaks_.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  A married woman, then!  Well, there's nothing in the world like the devotion of a married woman.  It's a thing no married man knows anything about.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Oh! she doesn?t love me.  She is a good woman.  She is the only good woman I have ever met in my life.  CECIL GRAHAM.  The only good woman you have ever met in your life?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Yes!  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_Lighting a cigarette_.]  Well, you are a lucky fellow! Why, I have met hundreds of good women.  I never seem to meet any but good women.  The world is perfectly packed with good women.  To know them is a middle-class education.  LORD DARLINGTON.  This woman has purity and innocence.  She has everything we men have lost.  CECIL GRAHAM.  My dear fellow, what on earth should we men do going about with purity and innocence?  A carefully thought-out buttonhole is much more effective.  DUMBY.  She doesn?t really love you then?  LORD DARLINGTON.  No, she does not!  DUMBY.  I congratulate you, my dear fellow.  In this world there are only two tragedies.  One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.  The last is much the worst; the last is a real tragedy!  But I am interested to hear she does not love you.  How long could you love a woman who didn?t love you, Cecil?  CECIL GRAHAM.  A woman who didn?t love me?  Oh, all my life!  DUMBY.  So could I.  But it's so difficult to meet one.  LORD DARLINGTON.  How can you be so conceited, DUMBY?  DUMBY.  I didn?t say it as a matter of conceit.  I said it as a matter of regret.  I have been wildly, madly adored.  I am sorry I have.  It has been an immense nuisance.  I should like to be allowed a little time to myself now and then.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Looking round_.]  Time to educate yourself, I suppose.  DUMBY.  No, time to forget all I have learned.  That is much more important, dear Tuppy.  [LORD AUGUSTUS _moves uneasily in his chair_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  What cynics you fellows are!  CECIL GRAHAM.  What is a cynic?  [_Sitting on the back of the sofa_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.  CECIL GRAHAM.  And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything, and doesn?t know the market price of any single thing.  LORD DARLINGTON.  You always amuse me, Cecil.  You talk as if you were a man of experience.  CECIL GRAHAM.  I am.  [_Moves up to front off fireplace_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  You are far too young!  CECIL GRAHAM.  That is a great error.  Experience is a question of instinct about life.  I have got it.  Tuppy hasn?t.  Experience is the name Tuppy gives to his mistakes.  That is all.  [LORD AUGUSTUS _looks round indignantly_.]  DUMBY.  Experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes.  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_Standing with his back to the fireplace_.]  One shouldn?t commit any.  [_Sees_ LADY WINDERMERE?S _fan on sofa_.]  DUMBY.  Life would be very dull without them.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Of course you are quite faithful to this woman you are in love with, Darlington, to this good woman?  LORD DARLINGTON.  Cecil, if one really loves a woman, all other women in the world become absolutely meaningless to one.  Love changes one?_I_ am changed.  CECIL GRAHAM.  Dear me!  How very interesting!  Tuppy, I want to talk to you.  [LORD AUGUSTUS _takes no notice_.]  DUMBY.  It's no use talking to Tuppy.  You might just as well talk to a brick wall.  CECIL GRAHAM.  But I like talking to a brick wall?it's the only thing in the world that never contradicts me!  Tuppy!  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Well, what is it?  What is it?  [_Rising and going over to_ CECIL GRAHAM.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  Come over here.  I want you particularly.  [_Aside_.] Darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love, and that sort of thing, and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  No, really! really!  CECIL GRAHAM.  [_In a low voice_.]  Yes, here is her fan.  [_Points to the fan_.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Chuckling_.]  By Jove!  By Jove!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Up by door_.]  I am really off now, Lord Darlington. I am sorry you are leaving England so soon.  Pray call on us when you come back!  My wife and I will be charmed to see you!  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Upstage with_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  I am afraid I shall be away for many years.  Good-night!  CECIL GRAHAM.  Arthur!  LORD WINDERMERE.  What?  CECIL GRAHAM.  I want to speak to you for a moment.  No, do come!  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Putting on his coat_.]  I can?t?I?m off!  CECIL GRAHAM.  It is something very particular.  It will interest you enormously.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling_.]  It is some of your nonsense, Cecil.  CECIL GRAHAM.  It isn?t!  It isn?t really.  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Going to him_.]  My dear fellow, you mustn?t go yet.  I have a lot to talk to you about.  And Cecil has something to show you.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Walking over_.]  Well, what is it?  CECIL GRAHAM.  Darlington has got a woman here in his rooms.  Here is her fan.  Amusing, isn?t it?  [_A pause_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Good God!  [_Seizes the fan_?DUMBY _rises_.]  CECIL GRAHAM.  What is the matter?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington!  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Turning round_.]  Yes!  LORD WINDERMERE.  What is my wife's fan doing here in your rooms?  Hands off, Cecil.  Don?t touch me.  LORD DARLINGTON.  Your wife's fan?  LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes, here it is!  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Walking towards him_.]  I don?t know!  LORD WINDERMERE.  You must know.  I demand an explanation.  Don?t hold me, you fool.  [_To_ CECIL GRAHAM.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Aside_.]  She is here after all!  LORD WINDERMERE.  Speak, sir!  Why is my wife's fan here?  Answer me!  By God!  I?ll search your rooms, and if my wife's here, I?ll?  [_Moves_.]  LORD DARLINGTON.  You shall not search my rooms.  You have no right to do so.  I forbid you!  LORD WINDERMERE.  You scoundrel!  I?ll not leave your room till I have searched every corner of it!  What moves behind that curtain?  [_Rushes towards the curtain C._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Enters behind R._]  Lord Windermere!  LORD WINDERMERE.  Mrs. Erlynne!  [_Every one starts and turns round_.  LADY WINDERMERE _slips out from behind the curtain and glides from the room L._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I am afraid I took your wife's fan in mistake for my own, when I was leaving your house to-night.  I am so sorry.  [_Takes fan from him_.  LORD WINDERMERE _looks at her in contempt_.  LORD DARLINGTON _in mingled astonishment and anger_.  LORD AUGUSTUS _turns away_.  _The other men smile at each other_.]                                  ACT DROP.     FOURTH ACT                            SCENE?Same as in Act I.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Lying on sofa_.]  How can I tell him?  I can?t tell him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there, and the real meaning of that?fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows?how can I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.  [_Touches bell_.]  How securely one thinks one lives?out of reach of temptation, sin, folly.  And then suddenly?Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do not rule it.  [_Enter_ ROSALIE _R._]  ROSALIE.  Did your ladyship ring for me?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?  ROSALIE.  His lordship did not come in till five o?clock.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Five o?clock?  He knocked at my door this morning, didn?t he?  ROSALIE.  Yes, my lady?at half-past nine.  I told him your ladyship was not awake yet.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Did he say anything?  ROSALIE.  Something about your ladyship's fan.  I didn?t quite catch what his lordship said.  Has the fan been lost, my lady?  I can?t find it, and Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms.  He has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well.  LADY WINDERMERE.  It doesn?t matter.  Tell Parker not to trouble.  That will do.                                                           [_Exit_ ROSALIE.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  She is sure to tell him.  I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly, nobly?and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.  Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange!  I would have publicly disgraced her in my own house.  She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women. . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us!  For even if she doesn?t tell, I must.  Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it.  To tell it is to live through it all again.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.  Words are perhaps the worst.  Words are merciless. . . . Oh! [_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Kisses her_.]  Margaret?how pale you look!  LADY WINDERMERE.  I slept very badly.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Sitting on sofa with her_.]  I am so sorry.  I came in dreadfully late, and didn?t like to wake you.  You are crying, dear.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I am crying, for I have something to tell you, Arthur.  LORD WINDERMERE.  My dear child, you are not well.  You?ve been doing too much.  Let us go away to the country.  You?ll be all right at Selby.  The season is almost over.  There is no use staying on.  Poor darling!  We?ll go away to-day, if you like.  [_Rises_.]  We can easily catch the 3.40. I?ll send a wire to Fannen.  [_Crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes; let us go away to-day.  No; I can?t go to-day, Arthur.  There is some one I must see before I leave town'some one who has been kind to me.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Rising and leaning over sofa_.]  Kind to you?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Far more than that.  [_Rises and goes to him_.]  I will tell you, Arthur, but only love me, love me as you used to love me.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Used to?  You are not thinking of that wretched woman who came here last night?  [_Coming round and sitting R. of her_.]  You don?t still imagine?no, you couldn?t.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I don?t.  I know now I was wrong and foolish.  LORD WINDERMERE.  It was very good of you to receive her last night?but you are never to see her again.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you say that?  [_A pause_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Holding her hand_.]  Margaret, I thought Mrs. Erlynne was a woman more sinned against than sinning, as the phrase goes.  I thought she wanted to be good, to get back into a place that she had lost by a moment's folly, to lead again a decent life.  I believed what she told me?I was mistaken in her.  She is bad?as bad as a woman can be.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur, Arthur, don?t talk so bitterly about any woman. I don?t think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as though they were two separate races or creations.  What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, jealousy, sin.  Bad women, as they are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice.  And I don?t think Mrs. Erlynne a bad woman?I know she's not.  LORD WINDERMERE.  My dear child, the woman's impossible.  No matter what harm she tries to do us, you must never see her again.  She is inadmissible anywhere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  But I want to see her.  I want her to come here.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Never!  LADY WINDERMERE.  She came here once as _your_ guest.  She must come now as _mine_.  That is but fair.  LORD WINDERMERE.  She should never have come here.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  It is too late, Arthur, to say that now. [_Moves away_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.  It was absolutely shameless, the whole thing.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur, I can?t bear it any longer.  I must tell you. Last night?  [_Enter_ PARKER _with a tray on which lie_ LADY WINDERMERE?S _fan and a card_.]  PARKER.  Mrs. Erlynne has called to return your ladyship's fan which she took away by mistake last night.  Mrs. Erlynne has written a message on the card.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, ask Mrs. Erlynne to be kind enough to come up. [_Reads card_.]  Say I shall be very glad to see her.                                                            [_Exit_ PARKER.]  She wants to see me, Arthur.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Takes card and looks at it_.]  Margaret, I _beg_ you not to.  Let me see her first, at any rate.  She's a very dangerous woman.  She is the most dangerous woman I know.  You don?t realise what you?re doing.  LADY WINDERMERE.  It is right that I should see her.  LORD WINDERMERE.  My child, you may be on the brink of a great sorrow. Don?t go to meet it.  It is absolutely necessary that I should see her before you do.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Why should it be necessary?  [_Enter_ PARKER.]  PARKER.  Mrs. Erlynne.  [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]                                                            [_Exit_ PARKER.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  [_To_ LORD WINDERMERE.] How do you do?  Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your fan.  I can?t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Good-bye?  [_Moves towards sofa with_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and sits down beside her_.]  Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes; I am going to live abroad again.  The English climate doesn?t suit me.  My?heart is affected here, and that I don?t like.  I prefer living in the south.  London is too full of fogs and?and serious people, Lord Windermere.  Whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don?t know, but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I?m leaving this afternoon by the Club Train.  LADY WINDERMERE.  This afternoon?  But I wanted so much to come and see you.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  How kind of you!  But I am afraid I have to go.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I am afraid not.  Our lives lie too far apart.  But there is a little thing I would like you to do for me.  I want a photograph of you, Lady Windermere?would you give me one?  You don?t know how gratified I should be.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, with pleasure.  There is one on that table.  I?ll show it to you. [_Goes across to the table_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Coming up to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and speaking in a low voice_.]  It is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct last night.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With an amused smile_.]  My dear Windermere, manners before morals!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Returning_.]  I?m afraid it is very flattering?I am not so pretty as that.  [_Showing photograph_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You are much prettier.  But haven?t you got one of yourself with your little boy?  LADY WINDERMERE.  I have.  Would you prefer one of those?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.  LADY|2
95| WINDERMERE.  I?ll go and get it for you, if you?ll excuse me for a moment.  I have one upstairs.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  So sorry, Lady Windermere, to give you so much trouble.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Moves to door R._]  No trouble at all, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thanks so much.  [_Exit_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._]  You seem rather out of temper this morning, Windermere.  Why should you be?  Margaret and I get on charmingly together.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I can?t bear to see you with her.  Besides, you have not told me the truth, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I have not told _her_ the truth, you mean.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Standing C._]  I sometimes wish you had.  I should have been spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance of the last six months.  But rather than my wife should know?that the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead, is living?a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be?rather than that, I was ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have ever had with my wife.  You don?t understand what that means to me.  How could you?  But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next her.  You sully the innocence that is in her. [_Moves L.C._]  And then I used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest.  You are not.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Why do you say that?  LORD WINDERMERE.  You made me get you an invitation to my wife's ball.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  For my daughter's ball?yes.  LORD WINDERMERE.  You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house you are found in a man's rooms?you are disgraced before every one. [_Goes up stage C._]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Turning round on her_.]  Therefore I have a right to look upon you as what you are?a worthless, vicious woman.  I have the right to tell you never to enter this house, never to attempt to come near my wife?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Coldly_.]  My daughter, you mean.  LORD WINDERMERE.  You have no right to claim her as your daughter.  You left her, abandoned her when she was but a child in the cradle, abandoned her for your lover, who abandoned you in turn.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Rising_.]  Do you count that to his credit, Lord Windermere?or to mine?  LORD WINDERMERE.  To his, now that I know you.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Take care?you had better be careful.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Oh, I am not going to mince words for you.  I know you thoroughly.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Looks steadily at him_.]  I question that.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I _do_ know you.  For twenty years of your life you lived without your child, without a thought of your child.  One day you read in the papers that she had married a rich man.  You saw your hideous chance.  You knew that to spare her the ignominy of learning that a woman like you was her mother, I would endure anything.  You began your blackmailing.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Shrugging her shoulders_.]  Don?t use ugly words, Windermere.  They are vulgar.  I saw my chance, it is true, and took it.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Yes, you took it?and spoiled it all last night by being found out.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With a strange smile_.]  You are quite right, I spoiled it all last night.  LORD WINDERMERE.  And as for your blunder in taking my wife's fan from here and then leaving it about in Darlington's rooms, it is unpardonable. I can?t bear the sight of it now.  I shall never let my wife use it again.  The thing is soiled for me.  You should have kept it and not brought it back.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I think I shall keep it.  [_Goes up_.]  It's extremely pretty.  [_Takes up fan_.]  I shall ask Margaret to give it to me.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I hope my wife will give it you.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Oh, I?m sure she will have no objection.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I wish that at the same time she would give you a miniature she kisses every night before she prays?It's the miniature of a young innocent-looking girl with beautiful _dark_ hair.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Ah, yes, I remember.  How long ago that seems!  [_Goes to sofa and sits down_.]  It was done before I was married.  Dark hair and an innocent expression were the fashion then, Windermere!  [_A pause_.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  What do you mean by coming here this morning?  What is your object?  [_Crossing L.C. and sitting_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With a note of irony in her voice_.]  To bid good-bye to my dear daughter, of course.  [LORD WINDERMERE _bites his under lip in anger_.  MRS. ERLYNNE _looks at him_, _and her voice and manner become serious_.  _In her accents at she talks there is a note of deep tragedy_. _For a moment she reveals herself_.]  Oh, don?t imagine I am going to have a pathetic scene with her, weep on her neck and tell her who I am, and all that kind of thing.  I have no ambition to play the part of a mother.  Only once in my life have I known a mother's feelings.  That was last night.  They were terrible?they made me suffer?they made me suffer too much.  For twenty years, as you say, I have lived childless,?I want to live childless still.  [_Hiding her feelings with a trivial laugh_.] Besides, my dear Windermere, how on earth could I pose as a mother with a grown-up daughter?  Margaret is twenty-one, and I have never admitted that I am more than twenty-nine, or thirty at the most.  Twenty-nine when there are pink shades, thirty when there are not.  So you see what difficulties it would involve.  No, as far as I am concerned, let your wife cherish the memory of this dead, stainless mother.  Why should I interfere with her illusions?  I find it hard enough to keep my own.  I lost one illusion last night.  I thought I had no heart.  I find I have, and a heart doesn?t suit me, Windermere.  Somehow it doesn?t go with modern dress.  It makes one look old.  [_Takes up hand-mirror from table and looks into it_.]  And it spoils one's career at critical moments.  LORD WINDERMERE.  You fill me with horror?with absolute horror.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Rising_.]  I suppose, Windermere, you would like me to retire into a convent, or become a hospital nurse, or something of that kind, as people do in silly modern novels.  That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don?t do such things?not as long as we have any good looks left, at any rate.  No?what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure.  Repentance is quite out of date.  And besides, if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.  And nothing in the world would induce me to do that.  No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives.  My coming into them has been a mistake?I discovered that last night.  LORD WINDERMERE.  A fatal mistake.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Smiling_.]  Almost fatal.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I am sorry now I did not tell my wife the whole thing at once.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I regret my bad actions.  You regret your good ones?that is the difference between us.  LORD WINDERMERE.  I don?t trust you.  I _will_ tell my wife.  It's better for her to know, and from me.  It will cause her infinite pain?it will humiliate her terribly, but it's right that she should know.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You propose to tell her?  LORD WINDERMERE.  I am going to tell her.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Going up to him_.]  If you do, I will make my name so infamous that it will mar every moment of her life.  It will ruin her, and make her wretched.  If you dare to tell her, there is no depth of degradation I will not sink to, no pit of shame I will not enter.  You shall not tell her?I forbid you.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Why?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_After a pause_.]  If I said to you that I cared for her, perhaps loved her even?you would sneer at me, wouldn?t you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  I should feel it was not true.  A mother's love means devotion, unselfishness, sacrifice.  What could you know of such things?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You are right.  What could I know of such things?  Don?t let us talk any more about it?as for telling my daughter who I am, that I do not allow.  It is my secret, it is not yours.  If I make up my mind to tell her, and I think I will, I shall tell her before I leave the house?if not, I shall never tell her.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Angrily_.]  Then let me beg of you to leave our house at once.  I will make your excuses to Margaret.  [_Enter_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._  _She goes over to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _with the photograph in her hand_.  LORD WINDERMERE _moves to back of sofa_, _and anxiously watches_ MRS. ERLYNNE _as the scene progresses_.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  I am so sorry, Mrs. Erlynne, to have kept you waiting. I couldn?t find the photograph anywhere.  At last I discovered it in my husband's dressing-room?he had stolen it.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Takes the photograph from her and looks at it_.]  I am not surprised?it is charming.  [_Goes over to sofa with_ LADY WINDERMERE, _and sits down beside her_.  _Looks again at the photograph_.]  And so that is your little boy!  What is he called?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Gerard, after my dear father.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Laying the photograph down_.]  Really?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  If it had been a girl, I would have called it after my mother.  My mother had the same name as myself, Margaret.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  My name is Margaret too.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Indeed!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.  [_Pause_.]  You are devoted to your mother's memory, Lady Windermere, your husband tells me.  LADY WINDERMERE.  We all have ideals in life.  At least we all should have.  Mine is my mother.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Ideals are dangerous things.  Realities are better.  They wound, but they?re better.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  If I lost my ideals, I should lose everything.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Everything?  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  [_Pause_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Did your father often speak to you of your mother?  LADY WINDERMERE.  No, it gave him too much pain.  He told me how my mother had died a few months after I was born.  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke.  Then he begged me never to mention her name to him again.  It made him suffer even to hear it.  My father?my father really died of a broken heart.  His was the most ruined life know.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Rising_.]  Oh no, don?t.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  I think I had better.  My carriage must have come back by this time.  I sent it to Lady Jedburgh's with a note.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Arthur, would you mind seeing if Mrs. Erlynne's carriage has come back?  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Pray don?t trouble, Lord Windermere.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, Arthur, do go, please.  [LORD WINDERMERE _hesitated for a moment and looks at_ MRS. ERLYNNE. _She remains quite impassive_.  _He leaves the room_.]  [_To_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]  Oh!  What am I to say to you?  You saved me last night?  [_Goes towards her_.]  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Hush?don?t speak of it.  LADY WINDERMERE.  I must speak of it.  I can?t let you think that I am going to accept this sacrifice.  I am not.  It is too great.  I am going to tell my husband everything.  It is my duty.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  It is not your duty?at least you have duties to others besides him.  You say you owe me something?  LADY WINDERMERE.  I owe you everything.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Then pay your debt by silence.  That is the only way in which it can be paid.  Don?t spoil the one good thing I have done in my life by telling it to any one.  Promise me that what passed last night will remain a secret between us.  You must not bring misery into your husband's life.  Why spoil his love?  You must not spoil it.  Love is easily killed.  Oh! how easily love is killed.  Pledge me your word, Lady Windermere, that you will never tell him.  I insist upon it.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_With bowed head_.]  It is your will, not mine.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes, it is my will.  And never forget your child?I like to think of you as a mother.  I like you to think of yourself as one.  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Looking up_.]  I always will now.  Only once in my life I have forgotten my own mother?that was last night.  Oh, if I had remembered her I should not have been so foolish, so wicked.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With a slight shudder_.]  Hush, last night is quite over.  [_Enter_ LORD WINDERMERE.]  LORD WINDERMERE.  Your carriage has not come back yet, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  It makes no matter.  I?ll take a hansom.  There is nothing in the world so respectable as a good Shrewsbury and Talbot.  And now, dear Lady Windermere, I am afraid it is really good-bye.  [_Moves up C._] Oh, I remember.  You?ll think me absurd, but do you know I?ve taken a great fancy to this fan that I was silly enough to run away with last night from your ball.  Now, I wonder would you give it to me?  Lord Windermere says you may.  I know it is his present.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, certainly, if it will give you any pleasure.  But it has my name on it.  It has ?Margaret? on it.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  But we have the same Christian name.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, I forgot.  Of course, do have it.  What a wonderful chance our names being the same!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  Quite wonderful.  Thanks?it will always remind me of you. [_Shakes hands with her_.]  [_Enter_ PARKER.]  PARKER.  Lord Augustus Lorton.  Mrs. Erlynne's carriage has come.  [_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS.]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Good morning, dear boy.  Good morning, Lady Windermere. [_Sees_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]  Mrs. Erlynne!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  Are you quite well this morning?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Coldly_.]  Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  You don?t look at all well, Lord Augustus.  You stop up too late?it is so bad for you.  You really should take more care of yourself.  Good-bye, Lord Windermere. [_Goes towards door with a bow to_ LORD AUGUSTUS.  _Suddenly smiles and looks back at him_.]  Lord Augustus! Won?t you see me to my carriage?  You might carry the fan.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Allow me!  MRS. ERLYNNE.  No; I want Lord Augustus.  I have a special message for the dear Duchess.  Won?t you carry the fan, Lord Augustus?  LORD AUGUSTUS.  If you really desire it, Mrs. Erlynne.  MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_Laughing_.]  Of course I do.  You?ll carry it so gracefully.  You would carry off anything gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.  [_When she reaches the door she looks back for a moment at_ LADY WINDERMERE.  _Their eyes meet_.  _Then she turns_, _and exit C. followed by_ LORD AUGUSTUS.]  LADY WINDERMERE.  You will never speak against Mrs. Erlynne again, Arthur, will you?  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  She is better than one thought her.  LADY WINDERMERE.  She is better than I am.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Smiling as he strokes her hair_.]  Child, you and she belong to different worlds.  Into your world evil has never entered.  LADY WINDERMERE.  Don?t say that, Arthur.  There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in hand.  To shut one's eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice.  LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Moves down with her_.]  Darling, why do you say that?  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Sits on sofa_.]  Because I, who had shut my eyes to life, came to the brink.  And one who had separated us?  LORD WINDERMERE.  We were never separated.  LADY WINDERMERE.  We never must be again.  O Arthur, don?t love me less, and I will trust you more.  I will trust you absolutely.  Let us go to Selby.  In the Rose Garden at Selby the roses are white and red.  [_Enter_ LORD AUGUSTUS _C._]  LORD AUGUSTUS.  Arthur, she has explained everything!  [LADY WINDERMERE _looks horribly frightened at this_.  LORD WINDERMERE _starts_.  LORD AUGUSTUS _takes_ WINDERMERE _by the arm and brings him to front of stage_.  _He talks rapidly and in a low voice_.  LADY WINDERMERE _stands watching them in terror_.]  My dear fellow, she has explained every demmed thing.  We all wronged her immensely.  It was entirely for my sake she went to Darlington's rooms.  Called first at the Club?fact is, wanted to put me out of suspense?and being told I had gone on?followed?naturally frightened when she heard a lot of us coming in?retired to another room?I assure you, most gratifying to me, the whole thing.  We all behaved brutally to her.  She is just the woman for me. Suits me down to the ground.  All the conditions she makes are that we live entirely out of England.  A very good thing too.  Demmed clubs, demmed climate, demmed cooks, demmed everything.  Sick of it all!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Frightened_.]  Has Mrs. Erlynne??  LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Advancing towards her with a low bow_.]  Yes, Lady Windermere?  Mrs. Erlynne has done me the honour of accepting my hand.  LORD WINDERMERE.  Well, you are certainly marrying a very clever woman!  LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Taking her husband's hand_.]  Ah, you?re marrying a very good woman!  FIRST ACT                                     SCENE                _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_.  [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under large yew tree_.]  LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley?  HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.  LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?  HESTER.  We have not many.  LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?  HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as France and England put together.  LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy. [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of my always knitting mufflers for you if you won?t wear them?  SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.  LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn?t come to a more charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of Parliament, Mr. Kettle?  SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.  LADY CAROLINE.  He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his name before in the whole course of one's life, which speaks volumes for a man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.  HESTER.  I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.  LADY CAROLINE.  I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord Brancaster's.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don?t believe she ran away more than once.  HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.  LADY CAROLINE.  Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.  Lady Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to have taken quite a fancy to him.  I am not sure, however, that Jane is right in taking him out of his position.  In my young days, Miss Worsley, one never met any one in society who worked for their living.  It was not considered the thing.  HESTER.  In America those are the people we respect most.  LADY CAROLINE.  I have no doubt of it.  HESTER.  Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature!  He is so simple, so sincere.  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come across.  It is a privilege to meet _him_.  LADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex. English women conceal their feelings till after they are married.  They show them then.  HESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young man and a young girl?  [_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a cushion_.]  LADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just saying what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a wonderful power of selection.  It is quite a gift.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all do fit in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American visitor will carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life.  [_To Footman_.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my shawl.  The Shetland. Get the Shetland.  [_Exit Footman for shawl_.]  [_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]  GERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.  It means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear mother will be delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night. Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how difficult it is to get her to go anywhere.  GERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord Illingworth had made me such an offer.  [_Enter Footman with shawl_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come up and meet him.  [_To Footman_.]  Just wait, Francis.  [_Writes letter_.]  LADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.  GERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to show myself worthy of it.  LADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.  GERALD.  [_To_ HESTER.]  _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss Worsley.  HESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?  GERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me?things that were out of the reach of hope before may be within hope's reach now.  HESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a hope.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that may not be true.  LADY CAROLINE.  I don?t think that England should be represented abroad by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She was made to be an ambassador's wife.  LADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering people's names, and forgetting their faces.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?  [_To Footman_.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a line to your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and to say she really must come to dinner.  [_Exit Footman_.]  GERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [_To_ HESTER.] Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?  HESTER.  With pleasure.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot's good fortune.  He is quite a _prot?g?_ of mine.  And I am particularly pleased that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord without my suggesting anything.  Nobody likes to be asked favours.  I remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season, because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one.  LADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to me. It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking to be in any respectable household.  I don?t wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to get rid of her.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.  LADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had better go and put on your overshoes at once.  SIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.  LADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that, John. Pray do as I tell you.  [SIR JOHN _gets up and goes off_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!  [_Enter_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is said to be well timbered.  MRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.  MRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that effect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I remember the occurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of joy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large party staying here at the time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It's running away from danger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.  LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing with fire.  MRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never gets even singed.  It is the people who don?t know how to play with it who get burned up.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don?t know how the world would get on with such a theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don?t say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much better time than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to us than are forbidden to them.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought of that.  [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?  KELVIL.  I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.  It has been an arduous task.  The demands on the time of a public man are very heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed.  And I don?t think they meet with adequate recognition.  LADY CAROLINE.  John, have you got your overshoes on?  SIR JOHN.  Yes, my love.  LADY CAROLINE.  I think you had better come over here, John.  It is more sheltered.  SIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline.  LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  You had better sit beside me.  [SIR JOHN _rises and goes across_.]  LADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr. Kelvil?  KELVIL.  On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield.  On Purity.  LADY STUTFIELD.  That must be such a very, very interesting thing to write about.  KELVIL.  It is the one subject of really national importance, nowadays, Lady Stutfield.  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question before Parliament meets.  I find that the poorer classes of this country display a marked desire for a higher ethical standard.  LADY STUTFIELD.  How quite, quite nice of them.  LADY CAROLINE.  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics, Mr. Kettle?  SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.  KELVIL.  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in our political life, Lady Caroline.  Women are always on the side of morality, public and private.  LADY STUTFIELD.  It is so very, very gratifying to hear you say that.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes!?the moral qualities in women?that is the important thing.  I am afraid, Caroline, that dear Lord Illingworth doesn?t value the moral qualities in women as much as he should.  [_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  LADY STUTFIELD.  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very wicked.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  But what world says that, Lady Stutfield?  It must be the next world.  This world and I are on excellent terms.  [_Sits down beside_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  LADY STUTFIELD.  Every one _I_ know says you are very, very wicked.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, Lady Stutfield.  I have given up trying to reform him.  It would take a Public Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that.  But you have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth, haven?t you?  Gerald Arbuthnot has tol|2
96|d us of his good fortune; it is really most kind of you.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, don?t say that, Lady Hunstanton.  Kind is a dreadful word.  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met him, and he?ll be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish enough to think of doing.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  He is an admirable young man.  And his mother is one of my dearest friends.  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty American.  She is very pretty, is she not?  LADY CAROLINE.  Far too pretty.  These American girls carry off all the good matches.  Why can?t they stay in their own country?  They are always telling us it is the Paradise of women.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve, they are so extremely anxious to get out of it.  LADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley's parents?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing their parents.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss Worsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy millionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained my son quite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don?t know how he made his money, originally.  KELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever source her large fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley.  She dresses exceedingly well.  All Americans do dress well.  They get their clothes in Paris.  MRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die they go to Paris.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do they go to?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.  KELVIL.  I am afraid you don?t appreciate America, Lord Illingworth.  It is a very remarkable country, especially considering its youth.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.  It has been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them talk one would imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far as civilisation goes they are in their second.  KELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American politics.  I suppose you allude to that?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.  They certainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country.  I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don?t think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.  KELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore.  However, the House of Commons really does very little harm.  You can?t make people good by Act of Parliament,?that is something.  KELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special vice of the age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life.  The less said about life's sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.  KELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr. Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really admirable recreations for the poor during the winter.  And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind.  LADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor, Jane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much love of pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is what we want in modern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy at all.  KELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.  LADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word ?health.?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so well the popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman galloping after a fox?the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.  KELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as a better institution than the House of Commons?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes us a civilised body.  KELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.] Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one has given them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is serious except passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and never has been.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is all.  The only serious form of intellect I know is the British intellect.  And on the British intellect the illiterates play the drum.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the drum?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the leading articles in the London newspapers.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the newspapers?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs. [_Rises with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth told me this morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly sins.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I will certainly speak to the gardener.  [_Exit_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  LADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes.  LADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows to run away with her?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.  [_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.]  Dear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED _sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  LADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great fault.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that one should believe evil of every one?  LADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield. Until, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that requires a great deal of investigation nowadays.  LADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life.  LADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty.  KELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but he seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which is so important in this century.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?  KELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the beauty of our English home-life.  I would say that he was tainted with foreign ideas on the subject.  LADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life, is there?  KELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady Stutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.  LADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?  KELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as a toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman is the intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.  Without her we should forget the true ideals.  [_Sits down beside_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  LADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.  LADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?  SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.  KELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.  LADY CAROLINE.  Family?  KELVIL.  Yes.  LADY CAROLINE.  How many?  KELVIL.  Eight.  [LADY STUTFIELD _turns her attention to_ LORD ALFRED.]  LADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the seaside?  [SIR JOHN _shrugs his shoulders_.]  KELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady Caroline.  LADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?  KELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.  LADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of gratification to Mrs. Kettle.  SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.  LADY STUTFIELD.  [_To_ LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.  LORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them when I?m in debt.  LADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in debt.  LORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn?t my debts I shouldn?t have anything to think about.  All the chaps I know are in debt.  LADY STUTFIELD.  But don?t the people to whom you owe the money give you a great, great deal of annoyance?  [_Enter Footman_.]  LORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don?t.  LADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She won?t dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in the evening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest of women. Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [_Hands letter to_ LADY CAROLINE.]  LADY CAROLINE.  [_Looking at it_.]  A little lacking in femininity, Jane. Femininity is the quality I admire most in women.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Taking back letter and leaving it on table_.]  Oh! she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should hear what the Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right hand in the parish.  [_Footman speaks to her_.]  In the Yellow Drawing-room.  Shall we all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in to tea?  LADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [_They rise and proceed to go off_.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD?S cloak.]  LADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady Stutfield's cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.  [_Enter_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  SIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [_Exeunt_.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their husbands, beautiful women never are!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are always so occupied in being jealous of other people's husbands.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired of conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.  Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too brilliant. Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one should be serious, except the thing that is worshipped.  MRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don?t.  MRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for the last quarter of an hour.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery'she is a mood.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don?t last.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.  [_Enter_ HESTER _and_ GERALD.]  GERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me, Lady Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I shall make a good secretary.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.  [_Talks to him_.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?  HESTER.  Very much indeed.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Don?t find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?  HESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and the stupid people never talk.  HESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn?t like you I wouldn?t have made you the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you with me.  [_Exit_ HESTER _with_ GERALD.]  Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!  MRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can?t stand the American young lady.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?  MRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice too, that she was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.  MRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don?t mind plain women being Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  But she is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.  [_Looks steadfastly at_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?  MRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe?on yourself.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don?t believe in the existence of Puritan women?  I don?t think there is a woman in the world who would not be a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is that which makes women so irresistibly adorable.  MRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would object to being kissed?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she?d do if I kissed her?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?  MRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don?t you know that I always succeed in whatever I try?  MRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.  They lean on us.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.  MRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment of triumph.  MRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [_A pause_.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like you for.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad qualities.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don?t be too conceited about them.  You may lose them as you grow old.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born old but grows young.  That is the comedy of life.  MRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is life's tragedy.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the mysterious reason why you will always like me?  MRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for both of us.  MRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except death, and live down anything except a good reputation.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never been subjected.  MRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?  MRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.  [_Enter Footman_.]  FRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.  FRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Exit_.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last refuge of the complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes, let us stay here. The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden.  MRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of your foil.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT?S _letter on table_, _and takes it up and looks at envelope_.]  What a curious handwriting!  It reminds me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Who?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of no importance.  [_Throws letter down_, _and passes up the steps of the terrace with_ MRS. ALLONBY.  _They smile at each other_.]                                    SCENE   _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.                                _Door_ R.C.  [_Ladies seated on sofas_.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a little!  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don?t they?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!  MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman's duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.  [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.  LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it.  LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper place.  MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?  LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.  MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they?re not married?  LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a wife.  It's perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry within twelve months.  LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they?re in love with some one who, perhaps, is tied to another?  LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to meddle with other people's property.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I don?t think that we should ever be spoken of as other people's property.  All men are married women's property.  That is the only true definition of what married women's property really is.  But we don?t belong to any one.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays, all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely changed since my young days, but I?m bound to state that poor dear Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I?m tired of meeting him.  LADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don?t you?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet. I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.  LADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.  MRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well. She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland's daughters.  LADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly fair-haired woman with no chin.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a square chin.  Ernest's chin is far too square.  LADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man's chin can be too square? I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be quite, quite square.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.  LADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn?t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he has got no conversation.  What he talks about I don?t know.  I haven?t listened to him for years.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems! But all life is very, very sad, is it not?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d?heure_ made up of exquisite moments.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and say anything that was unkind or true?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as calmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men's good temper shows they are not so sensitive as we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between husband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell everybody else.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating it.  MRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course of his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn?t believe him, I needn?t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any kind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found out then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!  MRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman's first love.  That is their clumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What we like is to be a man's last romance.  LADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It's very, very beautiful.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don?t mean to tell me that you won?t forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever hear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.  LADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They apparently are getting remarkably rare.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they?re quite out of date.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.  MRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes?is it not??very, very like them.  LADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true, Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to be.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don?t think the frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!  MRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can?t help himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very different.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most, most trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think it would be so very, very helpful.  MRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn?t be such a thing.  The institution is wrong.  LADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.  LADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.  MRS. CAROLINE.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?  MRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don?t attract him.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about other women.  MRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven?t got.  But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of useful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us everything we don?t want.  LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments.  MRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved real|2
97|ly badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with variations.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single word you say.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite entrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of details that are so very, very important.  LADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal Man is to be.  MRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite enough for him.  LADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they not?  MRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to grow tired of him.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful. Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are there more than one?  MRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!  MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.  LADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the American young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn?t understand much.  I think I had better go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER WORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose you have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the library.  HESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn?t believe everything that was said, you know, dear.  HESTER.  I didn?t believe any of it  LADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.  HESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn?t believe that any women could really hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your guests.  [_An awkward pause_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America. Quite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.  HESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But true American society consists simply of all the good women and good men we have in our country.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant too.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers. We don?t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.  HESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!  MRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?  LADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?  LADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven?t got in America, I am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.  MRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their mothers and their manners.  HESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady Caroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the steamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or stone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it not, at that place that has the curious name?  HESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here. This sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than strange?  You rich people in England, you don?t know how you are living. How could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the good.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on others and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your pomp and wealth and art you don?t know how to live?you don?t even know that.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have lost life's secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow, selfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It lies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with gold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.  LADY STUTFIELD.  I don?t think one should know of these things.  It is not very, very nice, is it?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English society so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much admired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said of you?but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he is on beauty.  HESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with a hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No dinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to him?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the street you would turn your head away.  I don?t complain of their punishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil over her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!  HESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don?t let them be the only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them both be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don?t punish the one and let the other go free.  Don?t have one law for men and another for women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what is a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be unjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud, will be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not regarded.  LADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask you for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come up.  But I didn?t hear you announced.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton, just as I was.  You didn?t tell me you had a party.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the house, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings bell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends. Lady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young American friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how wicked we are.  HESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton. But there are some things in England?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline's brother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.  [_Enter Footman_.]  Take Mrs. Arbuthnot's things.  [_Exit Footman with wraps_.]  HESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry for the pain I must have caused you?I?  LADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little speech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part about my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad for him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am bound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent company, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one's own relations.  LADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends with Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you told us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot comes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.  MRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I expect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.  LADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?  MRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.  LADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the terrace?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the dowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are only going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But don?t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so much, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald his secretary?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has the highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don?t know Lord Illingworth, I believe, dear.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don?t.  I live so much out of the world, and see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was a very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn?t, I believe.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth is quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does?well, he does nothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don?t know that he cares much for the subjects in which you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think, Caroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?  LADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But Lord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he couldn?t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a young man still, and he has only come to his title within?how long exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?  LADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago. Of course, there were a great many people between the present Lord Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was?who was there, Caroline?  LADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret's baby.  You remember how anxious she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband died shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord Ascot's sons, who, I am told, beats her.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family. And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic, or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite sane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead's with straws in his hair, or something very odd about him.  I can?t recall what.  I often regret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son get the title.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth's mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one of the Duchess of Jerningham's pretty daughters, and she married Sir Thomas Harford, who wasn?t considered a very good match for her at the time, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them all quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady Hunstanton?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was it fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has had.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once. Might I see him?  Can he be sent for?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into the dining-room to fetch him.  I don?t know what keeps the gentlemen so long.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She was quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms with his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It doesn?t matter.  [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY STUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]  THE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have never enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs. Arbuthnot to come to me at last.  THE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny will be quite jealous of you.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you to-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.  THE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is happiest alone.  She is happiest alone.  LADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his wife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed across the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who with LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?  MRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been in the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole time.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.  MRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a lecture.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose it is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you give me?  MRS. ALLONBY.  A week.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.  [_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]  GERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don?t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald. I shouldn?t have come.  GERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord Illingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.  GERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.] I?ll be back in a moment.  People's mothers always bore me to death.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.  MRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns round and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees her_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_ GERALD.]  GERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as his private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a wonderful opening for me, isn?t it?  I hope he won?t be disappointed in me, that is all.  You?ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won?t you?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest himself in you for the moment.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD?S _shoulder_.]  Oh, Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son, Lord Illingworth.  GERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is awfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth doesn?t know.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!  GERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel an awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have had so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other chaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn?t seem to mind that.  He has been awfully good to me, mother.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really want you as his secretary.  GERALD.  Mother!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so few advantages.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do come over.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don?t let your charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is quite settled, isn?t it?  GERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black velvet.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room? Miss Worsley is going to play.  You?ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, won?t you?  You don?t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to the rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the violin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny's hearing is a little defective, is it not?  THE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can?t even hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many resources in herself, many resources.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?  THE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly going.  But she's never morbid, never morbid.  GERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord Illingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think, somehow, you don?t mean what you said to me.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Aren?t you coming?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join you later on.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate that, dear.  LADY CAROLINE.  John!  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don?t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord Illingworth.  We can?t spare her.  [_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from music-room_.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of him.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot, Rachel?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to any name.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so?but why Gerald?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke?after my father.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what in over is over.  All I have got to say now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be something very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my life seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something, it lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of him.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over twenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as much mine as yours.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the child who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of want?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was not I who left you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name. Before my son was born, I implored you to marry me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I wasn?t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was twenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father's garden.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for saying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly. My mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn?t take anything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn?t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father was different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that it was your duty to marry me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every man is when he is young.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly not go away with you.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]?to go away with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has tainted every moment of my days?  You don?t realise what my past has been in suffering and in shame.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think Gerald's future considerably more important than your past.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly what you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk sentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don?t let us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the common-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for our son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at present?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate English town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you are mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made him so.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with a mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming offer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And now, simply because it turns out that I am the boy's own father and he my own son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if I were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but as he is my own flesh and blood you won?t.  How utterly illogical you are!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to him for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won?t tell him in what relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren?t tell him.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated him to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust judge he will be to you.  Don?t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by loving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don?t take my son away from me.  I have had twenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only one thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and success.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There was no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have remembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible accident.  Forget it.  Don?t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have in the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the little vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of water; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that. George, don?t take Gerald from me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to Gerald's career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.  [_Enter_ GERALD.]  GERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord Illingworth?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for some reason.  GERALD.  Why, mother?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I didn?t know you were so anxious to leave me.  GERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite happy with you.  But a man can?t stay always with his mother.  No chap does.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth's secretary.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private secretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don?t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am the best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the qualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even thought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don?t wish your son to accept this post?  GERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We are quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not repeat it.  GERALD.  Mother?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will leave you.  You may have some other reason you don?t wish me to hear.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as settled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together. And Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted very, very wisely.  [_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands immobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]                                   SCENE      _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_.  _Door at back leading on to                                 terrace_.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _and_ GERALD, R.C.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _lolling on a sofa_.  GERALD _in a chair_.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I knew she would come round in the end.  GERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know she doesn?t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I couldn?t pass an examination now to save my life.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.  GERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don?t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you?ve got on your side the most wonderful thing in the world?youth!  There is nothing like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in life's lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom waiting for it.  Every|2
98| one is born a king, and most people die in exile, like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn?t do?except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community.  GERALD.  But you don?t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.  GERALD.  I don?t remember my father; he died years ago.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.  GERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father. I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts his hand on_ GERALD?S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald?  GERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such a mother as I have had.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that most mothers don?t quite understand their sons.  Don?t realise, I mean, that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name. After all, Gerald, you couldn?t be expected to pass all your life in such a hole as Wrockley, could you?  GERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother's love is very touching, of course, but it is often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in it.  GERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their interests are so petty, aren?t they?  GERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don?t care much about.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort of thing.  GERALD.  Oh, yes, she's always going to church.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays.  You want to be modern, don?t you, Gerald? You want to know life as it really is.  Not to be put of with any old-fashioned theories about life.  Well, what you have to do at present is simply to fit yourself for the best society.  A man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world.  The future belongs to the dandy.  It is the exquisites who are going to rule.  GERALD.  I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they don?t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  By the way, Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.  Sentiment is all very well for the button-hole.  But the essential thing for a necktie is style.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.  GERALD.  [_Laughing_.]  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don?t know how to talk.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.  GERALD.  But it is very difficult to get into society isn?t it?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people?that is all!  GERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of it simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule society.  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over.  You might just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once.  GERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women are pictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman really means?which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do?look at her, don?t listen to her.  GERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren?t they?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over mind?just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.  GERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they have?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak over the strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.  GERALD.  But haven?t women got a refining influence?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.  GERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren?t there?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.  GERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren?t there?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.  GERALD.  But do you think women shouldn?t be good?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they?d all become good at once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.  GERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious.  Both are disappointed.  GERALD.  But don?t you think one can be happy when one is married?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married man, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.  GERALD.  But if one is in love?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the reason one should never marry.  GERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn?t it?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself. And one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a romance.  But a really _grande passion_ is comparatively rare nowadays. It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.  That is the one use of the idle classes in a country, and the only possible explanation of us Harfords.  GERALD.  Harfords, Lord Illingworth?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is my family name.  You should study the Peerage, Gerald.  It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done.  And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectly new life with me, and I want you to know how to live.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _appears on terrace behind_.]  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live in it!  [_Enter_ L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ DR. DAUBENY.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  Well, I suppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what his new duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good advice over a pleasant cigarette.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, but I suppose I am too old now to learn.  Except from you, dear Archdeacon, when you are in your nice pulpit.  But then I always know what you are going to say, so I don?t feel alarmed.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah! dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.  Come, dear.  [_Enter_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned out for him.  Let us sit down.  [_They sit down_.]  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn?t she?  THE ARCHDEACON.  She was very deft with her needle once, quite a Dorcas. But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal.  She has not touched the tambour frame for nine or ten years.  But she has many other amusements.  She is very much interested in her own health.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?  Now, what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth?  Do tell us.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them.  And that, consequently, whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now I am quite out of my depth.  I usually am when Lord Illingworth says anything.  And the Humane Society is most careless. They never rescue me.  I am left to sink.  I have a dim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you are always on the side of the sinners, and I know I always try to be on the side of the saints, but that is as far as I get. And after all, it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! that quite does for me.  I haven?t a word to say. You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age.  We can?t follow Lord Illingworth.  Too much care was taken with our education, I am afraid. To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays.  It shuts one out from so much.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of his opinions.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are quite right, dear.  [GERALD _shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother_. _Enter_ LADY CAROLINE.]  LADY CAROLINE.  Jane, have you seen John anywhere?  LADY HUNSTANTON.  You needn?t be anxious about him, dear.  He is with Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the Yellow Drawing-room. They seem quite happy together.  You are not going, Caroline?  Pray sit down.  LADY CAROLINE.  I think I had better look after John.  [_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  It doesn?t do to pay men so much attention.  And Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about.  Lady Stutfield is very sympathetic.  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about another.  A beautiful nature.  [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  Ah! here is Sir John!  And with Mrs. Allonby too!  I suppose it was Mrs. Allonby I saw him with.  Sir John, Caroline has been looking everywhere for you.  MRS. ALLONBY.  We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dear Lady Hunstanton.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was the Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [_To the_ ARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn?t she?  THE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory, but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early childhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections, great pleasure.  [_Enter_ LADY STUTFIELD _and_ MR. KELVIL.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil been talking to you about?  LADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?  However, I know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.  What did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?  MRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very improving, I have no doubt.  MRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia. Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost all subjects.  They are excessively advanced.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is it not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one.?On the whole, the world is the same world, is it not?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes?those who believe the incredible, like the public?and those who do the improbable?  MRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the only thing that makes life worth living.  LADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful qualities in my own nature.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don?t become quite perfect all at once.  Do it gradually!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don?t intend to grow perfect at all.  At least, I hope I shan?t.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love us for our defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.  MRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We forgive adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from us.  [_Enter_ LORD ALFRED.  _He joins_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn?t we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many things women should never forgive.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman's life.  [_Moves slowly away to back of stage_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I believe there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very, very easily.  MRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.  LADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived.  KELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life's aim, if it has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are not nearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so nervous about the future.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Shakes her fan at him_.]  I don?t know how it is, dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to me excessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to you.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is destruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing survives being thought of.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don?t understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But I have no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don?t believe in women thinking too much.  Women should think in moderation, as they should do all things in moderation.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.  Nothing succeeds like excess.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an admirable maxim.  But I?m beginning to forget everything.  It's a great misfortune.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities, Lady Hunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman is the beginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman's bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You always find out that one's most glaring fault is one's most important virtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.  [_Enter_ FARQUHAR.]  FARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny's carriage!  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.  THE ARCHDEACON.  [_Rising_.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton. Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny's bad nights.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  Well, I won?t keep you from her.  [_Goes with him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.  THE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never touches solids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is wonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to complain of.  [_Exit with_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]  MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Goes over to_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a beautiful moon to-night.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything that is inconstant is charming nowadays.  MRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the truth.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.  [_Exeunt_ SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL _and_ LORD ALFRED.]  GERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [_Moves towards with_ MRS. ALLONBY _and_ GERALD.]  [LADY CAROLINE _enters_, _looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite direction to that taken by_ SIR JOHN _and_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!  GERALD.  What, mother!  [_Exit_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _with_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.  GERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a great surprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of this month.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.  GERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I?ll be back in five minutes. [_Exit_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him?not with him!  I couldn?t bear it.  [_Walks up and down_.]  [_Enter_ HESTER.]  HESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?  HESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You are so different from the other women here.  When you came into the Drawing-room this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are things that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss Worsley.  HESTER.  I didn?t know you had heard it.  But I knew you would agree with me.  A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn?t she?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.  HESTER.  She shouldn?t be allowed to come into the society of good men and women?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.  HESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are children, in the same way also?  HESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited on the children.  It is a just law.  It is God's law.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God's terrible laws.  [_Moves away to fireplace_.]  HESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.  HESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of course there is position, no doubt, and money, but position and money are not everything, are they?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.  HESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.  HESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.  HESTER.  He couldn?t refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.  Ask him to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace at this moment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing together as I passed through the Music-room.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don?t trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of no consequence.  HESTER.  No, I?ll tell him you want him.  Do?do ask him to stay.  [_Exit_ HESTER.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won?t come?I know he won?t come.  [Enter LADY CAROLINE.  _She looks round anxiously_.  _Enter_ GERALD.]  LADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the terrace?  GERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.  LADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.  [_Exit_ LADY CAROLINE.]  GERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all about it.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so happy.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?  GERALD.  Don?t put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to leave you.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in such a place as Wrockley.  You don?t mind it.  But I?m ambitions; I want something more than that.  I want to have a career.  I want to do something that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth is going to help me.  He is going to do everything for me.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don?t go away with Lord Illingworth.  I implore you not to.  Gerald, I beg you!  GERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don?t seem to know your own mind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the Drawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and make objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance in life.  Yes, my one chance. You don?t suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every day, do you, mother?  It is very strange that when I have had such a wonderful piece of good luck, the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my own mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley.  Who could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever told you, far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I could?I could ask her to?Don?t you understand now, mother, what it means to me to be Lord Illingworth's secretary?  To start like that is to find a career ready for one?before one?waiting for one.  If I were Lord Illingworth's secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.  As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I know her views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [_A pause_.]  GERALD.  Then I have my ambition left, at any rate.  That is something?I am glad I have that!  You have always tried to crush my ambition, mother?haven?t you?  You have told me that the world is a wicked place, that success is not worth having, that society is shallow, and all that sort of thing?well, I don?t believe it, mother.  I think the world must be delightful.  I think society must be exquisite.  I think success is a thing worth having.  You have been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite wrong.  Lord Illingworth is a successful man.  He is a fashionable man.  He is a man who lives in the world and for it.  Well, I would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I would sooner see you dead.  GERALD.  Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth?  Tell me?tell me right out.  What is it?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is a bad man.  GERALD.  In what way bad?  I don?t understand what you mean.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will tell you.  GERALD.  I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn?t believe the same things as you do.  Well, men are different from women, mother.  It is natural that they should have different views.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or what he does not believe, that makes him bad.  It is what he is.  GERALD.  Mother, is it something you know of him?  Something you actually know?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is something I know.  GERALD.  Something you are quite sure of?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Quite sure of.  GERALD.  How long have you known it?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For twenty years.  GERALD.  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man's career?  And what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth's early life?  What business is it of ours?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What this man has been, he is now, and will be always.  GERALD.  Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did?  If he did anything shameful, I will not go away with him.  Surely you know me well enough for that?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, come near to me.  Quite close to me, as you used to do when you were a little boy, when you were mother's own boy. [GERALD _sits down betide his mother_.  _She runs her fingers through his hair_, _and strokes his hands_.]  Gerald, there was a girl once, she was very young, she was little over eighteen at the time.  George Harford?that was Lord Illingworth's name then?George Harford met her. She knew nothing about life.  He?knew everything.  He made this girl love him.  He made her love him so much that she left her father's house with him one morning.  She loved him so much, and he had promised to marry her!  He had solemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him. She was very young, and?and ignorant of what life really is.  But he put the marriage off from week to week, and month to month.?She trusted in him all the while.  She loved him.?Before her child was born?for she had a child'she implored him for the child's sake to marry her, that the child might have a name, that her sin might not be visited on the child, who was innocent.  He refused.  After the child was born she left him, taking the child away, and her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good, and pure in her ruined also.  She suffered terribly'she suffers now.  She will always suffer.  For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement.  She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing.  She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing that is a leper.  The fire cannot purify her.  The waters cannot quench her anguish.  Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep! no poppies forgetfulness!  She is lost!  She is a lost soul!?That is why I call Lord Illingworth a bad man.  That is why I don?t want my boy to be with him.  GERALD.  My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course.  But I dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth was.?After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice feelings at all, go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married, and live with him as his wife?  No nice girl would.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_After a pause_.]  Gerald, I withdraw all my objections.  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth, when and where you choose.  GERALD.  Dear mother, I knew you wouldn?t stand in my way.  You are the best woman God ever made.  And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don?t believe he is capable of anything infamous or base.  I can?t believe it of him?I can?t.  HESTER.  [_Outside_.]  Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in terror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]  HESTER.  Oh! save me'save me from him!  GERALD.  From whom?  HESTER.  He has insulted me!  Horribly insulted me!  Save me!  GERALD.  Who?  Who has dared??  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters at back of stage_.  HESTER _breaks from_ GERALD?S _arms and points to him_.]  GERALD  [_He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation_.]  Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God's earth, a thing as pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the woman I love most in the world with my own mother.  As there is a God in Heaven, I will kill you!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rushing across and catching hold of him_]  No! no!  GERALD.  [_Thrusting her back_.]  Don?t hold me, mother.  Don?t hold me?I?ll kill him!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!  GERALD.  Let me go, I say!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!  [GERALD _clutches his mother's hands and looks into her face_.  _She sinks slowly on the ground in shame_.  HESTER _steals towards the door_. LORD ILLINGWORTH _frowns and bites his lip_.  _After a time_ GERALD _raises his mother up_, _puts his am round her_, _and leads her from the room_.]                                    SCENE  _Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot's_.  _Large open French window at back_, _looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.  [GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]  [_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]  ALICE.  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.  [_Exit_ L.C.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Good morning, Gerald.  GERALD.  [_Rising_.]  Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs. Allonby.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Sitting down_.]  We came to inquire for your dear mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?  GERALD.  My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic?at least it always gets on one's nerves.  MRS. ALLONBY.  It's the same thing, nowadays.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am so glad I don?t know what you mean, dear.  I am afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you?re examining Mrs. Arbuthnot's pretty room.  Isn?t it nice and old-fashioned?  MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Surveying the room thro|2
99|ugh her lorgnette_.]  It looks quite the happy English home.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  That's just the word, dear; that just describes it. One feels your mother's good influence in everything she has about her, Gerald.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that a good influence is the worst in the world.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English home.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don?t shock one, pictures that one can look at without blushing.  MRS. ALLONBY.  But I like blushing.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing, if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell me I didn?t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very particular.  He wouldn?t let me know any of his men friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn?t she? By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don?t you?  GERALD.  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth's secretary.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you. What reason can you have?  GERALD.  I don?t think I should be suitable for the post.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary. But he says I am not serious enough.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, you really mustn?t talk like that in this house.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn?t know anything about the wicked society in which we all live.  She won?t go into it.  She is far too good.  I consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in the air.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance between the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by not being suitable?  GERALD.  Lord Illingworth's views of life and mine are too different.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn?t have any views of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by others in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering offer, and travelling with him you would see the world?as much of it, at least, as one should look at?under the best auspices possible, and stay with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in your career.  GERALD.  I don?t want to see the world: I?ve seen enough of it.  MRS. ALLONBY.  I hope you don?t think you have exhausted life, Mr. Arbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.  GERALD.  I don?t wish to leave my mother.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.  Not leave your mother!  If I were your mother I would insist on your going.  [_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]  ALICE.  Mrs. Arbuthnot's compliments, my lady, but she has a bad headache, and cannot see any one this morning.  [_Exit_ R.C.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Rising_.]  A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps you?ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald.  GERALD.  I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.  LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, to-morrow, then.  Ah, if you had a father, Gerald, he wouldn?t let you waste your life here.  He would send you off with Lord Illingworth at once.  But mothers are so weak.  They give up to their sons in everything.  We are all heart, all heart.  Come, dear, I must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid, is far from well.  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite wonderful.  He is the most sympathetic of husbands.  Quite a model. Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother.  MRS. ALLONBY.  Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.  GERALD.  Good-bye.  [_Exit_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.  GERALD _sits down and reads over his letter_.]  GERALD.  What name can I sign?  I, who have no right to any name. [_Signs name_, _puts letter into envelope_, _addresses it_, _and is about to seal it_, _when door_ L.C. _opens and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters_. GERALD _lays down sealing-wax_.  _Mother and son look at each other_.]  LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_Through French window at the back_.]  Good-bye again, Gerald.  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden.  Now, remember my advice to you'start at once with Lord Illingworth.  MRS. ALLONBY.  _Au revoir_, Mr. Arbuthnot.  Mind you bring me back something nice from your travels?not an Indian shawl?on no account an Indian shawl.  [_Exeunt_.]  GERALD.  Mother, I have just written to him.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  To whom?  GERALD.  To my father.  I have written to tell him to come here at four o?clock this afternoon.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He shall not come here.  He shall not cross the threshold of my house.  GERALD.  He must come.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, if you are going away with Lord Illingworth, go at once.  Go before it kills me: but don?t ask me to meet him.  GERALD.  Mother, you don?t understand.  Nothing in the world would induce me to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.  Surely you know me well enough for that.  No: I have written to him to say?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What can you have to say to him?  GERALD.  Can?t you guess, mother, what I have written in this letter?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.  GERALD.  Mother, surely you can.  Think, think what must be done, now, at once, within the next few days.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is nothing to be done.  GERALD.  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must marry you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Marry me?  GERALD.  Mother, I will force him to do it.  The wrong that has been done you must be repaired.  Atonement must be made.  Justice may be slow, mother, but it comes in the end.  In a few days you shall be Lord Illingworth's lawful wife.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald?  GERALD.  I will insist upon his doing it.  I will make him do it: he will not dare to refuse.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But, Gerald, it is I who refuse.  I will not marry Lord Illingworth.  GERALD.  Not marry him?  Mother!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.  GERALD.  But you don?t understand: it is for your sake I am talking, not for mine.  This marriage, this necessary marriage, this marriage which for obvious reasons must inevitably take place, will not help me, will not give me a name that will be really, rightly mine to bear.  But surely it will be something for you, that you, my mother, should, however late, become the wife of the man who is my father.  Will not that be something?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not marry him.  GERALD.  Mother, you must.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not.  You talk of atonement for a wrong done. What atonement can be made to me?  There is no atonement possible.  I am disgraced: he is not.  That is all.  It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens.  And the ending is the ordinary ending.  The woman suffers.  The man goes free.  GERALD.  I don?t know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: I hope it is not.  But your life, at any rate, shall not end like that.  The man shall make whatever reparation is possible.  It is not enough.  It does not wipe out the past, I know that.  But at least it makes the future better, better for you, mother.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.  GERALD.  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would give him a different answer.  Remember, he is my father.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  If he came himself, which he will not do, my answer would be the same.  Remember I am your mother.  GERALD.  Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like that; and I can?t understand why you won?t look at this matter from the right, from the only proper standpoint.  It is to take away the bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow that lies on your name, that this marriage must take place.  There is no alternative: and after the marriage you and I can go away together.  But the marriage must take place first.  It is a duty that you owe, not merely to yourself, but to all other women?yes: to all the other women in the world, lest he betray more.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I owe nothing to other women.  There is not one of them to help me.  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for pity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win it.  Women are hard on each other.  That girl, last night, good though she is, fled from the room as though I were a tainted thing.  She was right.  I am a tainted thing.  But my wrongs are my own, and I will bear them alone.  I must bear them alone.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me, or I with them?  We do not understand each other.  [_Enter_ HESTER _behind_.]  GERALD.  I implore you to do what I ask you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous a sacrifice?  None.  GERALD.  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own child?  None.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let me be the first, then.  I will not do it.  GERALD.  Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up to believe in it also.  Well, surely your religion, the religion that you taught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right.  You know it, you feel it.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not know it.  I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before God's altar and ask God's blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford.  I will not say the words the Church bids us to say.  I will not say them.  I dare not.  How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?  No: marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other.  It is not for such as him, or such as me.  Gerald, to save you from the world's sneers and taunts I have lied to the world.  For twenty years I have lied to the world.  I could not tell the world the truth.  Who can, ever?  But not for my own sake will I lie to God, and in God's presence.  No, Gerald, no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford.  It may be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so.  GERALD.  I don?t understand you now.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Men don?t understand what mothers are.  I am no different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace.  And yet, to bear you I had to look on death.  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it. Death fought with me for you.  All women have to fight with death to keep their children.  Death, being childless, wants our children from us. Gerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food.  Night and day all that long winter I tended you.  No office is too mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love?and oh! how _I_ loved _you_.  Not Hannah, Samuel more.  And you needed love, for you were weakly, and only love could have kept you alive.  Only love can keep any one alive.  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always fancy that when they come to man's estate and know us better they will repay us.  But it is not so.  The world draws them from our side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in darkness.  What should I have done in honest households?  My past was ever with me. . . . And you thought I didn?t care for the pleasant things of life.  I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I had no right.  You thought I was happier working amongst the poor.  That was my mission, you imagined.  It was not, but where else was I to go?  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.  It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . . And you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in Church duties.  But where else could I turn?  God's house is the only house where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too much in my heart.  For, though day after day, at morn or evensong, I have knelt in God's house, I have never repented of my sin. How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit!  Even now that you are bitter to me I cannot repent.  I do not.  You are more to me than innocence.  I would rather be your mother?oh! much rather!?than have been always pure . . . Oh, don?t you see? don?t you understand?  It is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me.  It is my disgrace that has bound you so closely to me.  It is the price I paid for you?the price of soul and body?that makes me love you as I do.  Oh, don?t ask me to do this horrible thing.  Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!  GERALD.  Mother, I didn?t know you loved me so much as that.  And I will be a better son to you than I have been.  And you and I must never leave each other . . . but, mother . . . I can?t help it . . . you must become my father's wife.  You must marry him.  It is your duty.  HESTER.  [_Running forwards and embracing_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  No, no; you shall not.  That would be real dishonour, the first you have ever known. That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.  Leave him and come with me.  There are other countries than England . . . Oh! other countries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands.  The world is very wide and very big.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No, not for me.  For me the world is shrivelled to a palm's breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.  HESTER.  It shall not be so.  We shall somewhere find green valleys and fresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.  Have we not both loved him?  GERALD.  Hester!  HESTER.  [_Waving him back_.]  Don?t, don?t!  You cannot love me at all, unless you love her also.  You cannot honour me, unless she's holier to you.  In her all womanhood is martyred.  Not she alone, but all of us are stricken in her house.  GERALD.  Hester, Hester, what shall I do?  HESTER.  Do you respect the man who is your father?  GERALD.  Respect him?  I despise him!  He is infamous.  HESTER.  I thank you for saving me from him last night.  GERALD.  Ah, that is nothing.  I would die to save you.  But you don?t tell me what to do now!  HESTER.  Have I not thanked you for saving _me_?  GERALD.  But what should I do?  HESTER.  Ask your own heart, not mine.  I never had a mother to save, or shame.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He is hard?he is hard.  Let me go away.  GERALD.  [_Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother_.]  Mother, forgive me: I have been to blame.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don?t kiss my hands: they are cold.  My heart is cold: something has broken it.  HESTER.  Ah, don?t say that.  Hearts live by being wounded.  Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow?oh, sorrow cannot break it.  Besides, what sorrows have you now?  Why, at this moment you are more dear to him than ever, _dear_ though you have _been_, and oh! how dear you _have_ been always.  Ah! be kind to him.  GERALD.  You are my mother and my father all in one.  I need no second parent.  It was for you I spoke, for you alone.  Oh, say something, mother.  Have I but found one love to lose another?  Don?t tell me that. O mother, you are cruel.  [_Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a sofa_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_To_ HESTER.]  But has he found indeed another love?  HESTER.  You know I have loved him always.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are very poor.  HESTER.  Who, being loved, is poor?  Oh, no one.  I hate my riches.  They are a burden.  Let him share it with me.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts Gerald is nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children. It is God's law.  HESTER.  I was wrong.  God's law is only Love.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Rises_, _and taking_ HESTER _by the hand_, _goes slowly over to where_ GERALD _is lying on the sofa with his head buried in his hands_.  _She touches him and he looks up_.]  Gerald, I cannot give you a father, but I have brought you a wife.  GERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you are away, Gerald . . . with . . . her?oh, think of me sometimes.  Don?t forget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray when we are happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.  HESTER.  Oh, you don?t think of leaving us?  GERALD.  Mother, you won?t leave us?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!  GERALD.  Mother!  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you always.  HESTER.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [_Exeunt_ HESTER _and_ GERALD. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _goes towards door_ L.C.   _Stops at looking-glass over mantelpiece and looks into it_.  _Enter_ ALICE R.C.]  ALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma?am.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [_Takes card from salver and looks at it_.]  Say I will not see him.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _enters_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _sees him in the glass and starts_, _but does not turn round_.  _Exit_ ALICE.]  What can you have to say to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say to me. You must leave this house.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me now, so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three.  I assure you, he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you last night.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my dishonour strongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Sitting down_.]  Last night was excessively unfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I wanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  A kiss may ruin a human life, George Harford.  _I_ know that.  _I_ know that too well.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won?t discuss that at present.  What is of importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely fond of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I admired his conduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what I should have liked a son of mine to be.  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side of the Puritans: that is always an error.  Now, what I propose is this.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours interests me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I can?t legitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.  Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of a place.  He can have Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough, which has the best shooting in the north of England, and the house in St. James Square.  What more can a gentleman require in this world?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic days.  As George Harford I had everything I wanted.  Now I have merely everything that other people want, which isn?t nearly so pleasant.  Well, my proposal is this.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to go.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year, and with me for the other six.  That is perfectly fair, is it not?  You can have whatever allowance you like, and live where you choose.  As for your past, no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald. There is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan in white muslin, but she doesn?t count.  She couldn?t tell the story without explaining that she objected to being kissed, could she?  And all the women would think her a fool and the men think her a bore.  And you need not be afraid that Gerald won?t be my heir.  I needn?t tell you I have not the slightest intention of marrying.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You come too late.  My son has no need of you.  You are not necessary.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you mean, Rachel?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That you are not necessary to Gerald's career.  He does not require you.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do not understand you.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Look into the garden.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _rises and goes towards window_.]  You had better not let them see you: you bring unpleasant memories.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _looks out and starts_.]  She loves him.  They love each other.  We are safe from you, and we are going away.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Where?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  We will not tell you, and if you find us we will not know you.  You seem surprised.  What welcome would you get from the girl whose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have shamed, from the mother whose dishonour comes from you?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You have grown hard, Rachel.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I was too weak once.  It is well for me that I have changed.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was very young at the time.  We men know life too early.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  And we women know life too late.  That is the difference between men and women.  [_A pause_.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, I want my son.  My money may be of no use to him now.  I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.  Bring us together, Rachel.  You can do it if you choose.  [_Sees letter on table_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There is no room in my boy's life for you.  He is not interested in _you_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then why does he write to me?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  What do you mean?  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What letter is this?  [_Takes up letter_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  That?is nothing.  Give it to me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is addressed to _me_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are not to open it.  I forbid you to open it.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And in Gerald's handwriting.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not to have been sent.  It is a letter he wrote to you this morning, before he saw me.  But he is sorry now he wrote it, very sorry.  You are not to open it.  Give it to me.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It belongs to me.  [_Opens it_, _sits down and reads it slowly_. MRS. ARBUTHNOT _watches him all the time_.]  You have read this letter, I suppose, Rachel?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You know what is in it?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don?t admit for a moment that the boy is right in what he says.  I don?t admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you.  I deny it entirely.  But to get my son back I am ready?yes, I am ready to marry you, Rachel?and to treat you always with the deference and respect due to my wife.  I will marry you as soon as you choose.  I give you my word of honour.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You made that promise to me once before and broke it.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I will keep it now.  And that will show you that I love my son, at least as much as you love him.  For when I marry you, Rachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.  High ambitions, too, if any ambition is high.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you serious?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do tell me your reasons.  They would interest me enormously.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have already explained them to my son.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose they were intensely sentimental, weren?t they?  You women live by your emotions and for them.  You have no philosophy of life.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You are right.  We women live by our emotions and for them.  By our passions, and for them, if you will.  I have two passions, Lord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you.  You cannot kill those. They feed each other.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as its brother?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald.  Do you think that terrible?  Well it is terrible.  All love is terrible.  All love is a tragedy.  I loved you once, Lord Illingworth.  Oh, what a tragedy for a woman to have loved you!  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So you really refuse to marry me?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Because you hate me?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And does my son hate me as you do?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  No.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am glad of that, Rachel.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He merely despises you.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a pity!  What a pity for him, I mean.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don?t be deceived, George.  Children begin by loving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely if ever do they forgive them.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Reads letter over again_, _very slowly_.]  May I ask by what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, this beautiful, passionate letter, believe that you should not marry his father, the father of your own child?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was not I who made him see it.  It was another.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What _fin-de-si?cle_ person?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The Puritan, Lord Illingworth.  [_A pause_.]  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces_, _then rises slowly and goes over to table where his hat and gloves are_.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is standing close to the table_.  _He picks up one of the gloves, and begins pulling it on_.] There is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is good-bye, is it?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.  LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How curious!  At this moment you look exactly as you looked the night you left me twenty years ago.  You have just the same expression in your mouth.  Upon my word, Rachel, no woman ever loved me as you did.  Why, you gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything I liked with.  You were the prettiest of playthings, the most fascinating of small romances . . . [_Pulls out watch_.]  Quarter to two!  Must be strolling back to Hunstanton.  Don?t suppose I shall see you there again. I?m sorry, I am, really.  It's been an amusing experience to have met amongst people of one's own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one's mistress, and one's?  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _snatches up glove and strikes_ LORD ILLINGWORTH _across the face with it_.  LORD ILLINGWORTH _starts_.  _He is dazed by the insult of his punishment_.  _Then he controls himself_, _and goes to window and looks out at his son_.  _Sighs and leaves the room_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Falls sobbing on the sofa_.]  He would have said it. He would have said it.  [_Enter_ GERALD _and_ HESTER _from the garden_.]  GERALD.  Well, dear mother.  You never came out after all.  So we have come in to fetch you.  Mother, you have not been crying?  [_Kneels down beside her_.]  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My boy!  My boy!  My boy!  [_Running her fingers through his hair_.]  HESTER.  [_Coming over_.]  But you have two children now.  You?ll let me be your daughter?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Looking up_.]  Would you choose me for a mother?  HESTER.  You of all women I have ever known.  [_They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round each other's waists_.  GERALD _goes to table_ L.C. _for his hat_.  _On turning round he sees_ LORD ILLINGWORTH?S _glove lying on the floor_, _and picks it up_.]  GERALD.  Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?  You have had a visitor. Who was it|2
100|?  MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [_Turning round_.]  Oh! no one.  No one in particular. A man of no importance. |2
