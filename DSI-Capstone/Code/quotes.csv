The secret of life is in art.,??
Though one can dine in New York one could not dwell there.,??
When one is in love one always begins by deceiving one's self and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what world calls a romance.,??
In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast. That is so dreadful of them! Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.,??
You know more than you think you know just as you know less than you want to know.,??
Murder is always a mistake - one should never do anything one cannot talk about after dinner,??
People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.,??
To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.,??
The aim of the liar is simply to charm to delight to give pleasure. He is the very basis of civilized society.,??
It is only fair to state with regard to modern journalists that they always apologize to one in private for what they have written against one in public,??
Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes,??
Wordsworth went to the Lakes but he was never a lake poet. He found in stones the sermons he had already hidden there.,??
Children have a natural antipathy to books - handicraft should be the basis of education. Boys and girls should be taught to use their hands to make something and they would be less apt to destroy and be mischievous.,??
Where there is sorrow there is holy ground,??
But what is the good of friendship if one cannot say exactly what one means? Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter but a true friend always says unpleasant things and does not mind giving pain. Indeed if he is a really true friend he prefers it for he knows that then he is doing good.,??
If you meet at dinner a man who has spent his life in educating himself you rise from the table richer and conscious that a high ideal has for a moment touched and sanctified your days.,??
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.,??
After a good dinner one can forgive anybody even one's own relations,??
Tread lightly she is near/ Under the snow/ Speak gently she can hear/ The daisies grow.,??
Looking good and dressing well is a necessity. Having a purpose in life is not.,??
I don't like principles. I prefer prejudices.,??
Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern; one is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly,??
The Americans are certainly hero-worshippers and always take their heroes from the criminal classes.,??
Indeed so far from being humorous the male American is the most abnormally serious creature who ever existed.... It is only fair to admit that he can exaggerate but even his exaggeration has a rational basis. It is not founded on wit or fancy; it does not spring from any poetic imagination....,??
Those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob,??
Women are meant to be loved not to be understood.,??
She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm.,??
Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them,??

Men marry because they are tired women because they are curious; both are disappointed.,??
Either that wallpaper goes or I do.,??
No crime is vulgar but all vulgarity is crime,??
The mere mechanical technique of acting can be taught but the spirit that is to give life to lifeless forms must be born in a man. No dramatic college can teach its pupils to think or to feel. It is Nature who makes our artists for us though it may be Art who taught them their right mode of expression.,??
Questions are never indiscreet: answers sometimes are,??
Woman begins by resisting a man's advances and ends up blocking his retreat.,??
It is grossly selfish to require of one's neighbour that he should think in the same way and hold the same opinions. Why should he?  If he can think he will probably think differently. If he cannot think it is monstrous to require thought of any kind.,??
Nothing is so aggravating as calmness.,??
I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that if I allowed it to do so it would absorb my whole nature my whole soul my very art itself.,??
The fact is the public make use of the classics of a country as a means of checking the progress of Art. They degrade the classics into authorities. They use them as bludgeons for preventing the free expression of Beauty in new forms.,??
To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance,??
The strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us. Men can be analyzed women merely adored.,??
London is full of women who trust their husbands. One can always recognize them. They look so thoroughly unhappy.,??
Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attraction of others.,??
As a wicked man I am a complete failure. Why there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life. Of course they only say it behind my back.,??
Vulgarity is the conduct of other people just as falsehoods are the truths of other people.,??
Vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.,??

The worst form of tyranny the world has ever known the tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.,??
If one tells the truth one is sure sooner or later to be found out,??
I was disappointed in Niagara -- most people must be disappointed in Niagara. Every American bride is taken there and the sight of the stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest if not the keenest disappointments in American married life.,??
In this world there are two tragedies. One is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it. The last is much the worst.,??
It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want of meaning their entire lack of style.,??
Time is waste of money.,??
Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world and people die of it just as they die of any other disease. Fortunately in England at any rate thought is not catching. Our splendid physique as a people is entirely due to our national stupidity.,??
The stage is not merely the meeting place of all the arts but is also the return of art to life.,??
Rich bachelors should be heavily taxed. It is not fair that some men should be happier than others.,??
Good taste is the excuse I have given for leading such a bad life.,??
I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time and prevents arguments.,??
To have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you.,??
To become a spectator of one's own life is to escape the suffering of life.,??
I can sympathize with everything except suffering.,??
While one should always study the method of a great artist one should never imitate his manner. The manner of an artist is essentially individual the method of an artist is absolutely universal. The first is personality which no one should copy; the second is perfection which all should aim at.,??
The greatest of all sins is stupidity.,??
The State is to make what is useful. The individual is to make what is beautiful.,??
Talk to a woman as if you loved her and to a man as if he bored you.,??
Lots of people act well but few people talk well. This shows that talking is the more difficult of the two.,??
Where there is sorrow there is holy ground.,??
Skepticism is the beginning of Faith.,??
The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.,??

Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets.,??
Scandal: gossip made tedious by morality.,??
One should never make one's debut with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age.,??
It is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest.,??
Music makes one feel so romantic - at least it always gets on one's nerves -which is the same thing nowadays.,??
Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humor in the woman.,??
Men always want to be a woman's first love. Women have a more subtle instinct: What they like is to be a man's last romance.,??
He must have a truly romantic nature for he weeps when there is nothing at all to weep about.,??
The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.,??
Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. They a,??
He hadn't a single redeeming vice.,??
The sick do not ask if the hand that smoothes their pillow is pure nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin.,??
One is absolutely sickened not by the crimes that the wicked have committed but by the punishments that the good have inflicted; and a community is infinitely more brutalized by the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occasional occurrence of crime.,??
Punctuality is the thief of time. Wilde I never travel without my diary. One should always have Something sensational to read in the train.,??
The English public as a mass takes no interest in a work of art until it is told that the work in question is immoral.,??
The more one analyses people the more all reasons for analysis disappear. Sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universal thing called human nature.,??
If property had simply pleasures we could stand it; but its duties make it unbearable. In the interest of the rich we must get rid of it.,??
Only mediocrities progress. An artist revolves in a cycle of masterpieces the first of which is no less perfect than the last.,??
What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress. Without it the world would stagnate or grow old or become colorless. By its curiosity Sin increases the experience of the race. Through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from monotony of type. In its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics.,??
I know not whether Laws be right or whether Laws be wrong; all that we know who live in goal is that the wall is strong; and that each day is like a year a year whose days are long.,??
He was always late on principle his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.,??
One can only give an unbiased opinion about things that do not interest one which is no doubt the reason an unbiased opinion is always valueless. The man who sees both sides of a question is a man who sees absolutely nothing.,??
Most of our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion. They never paint what they see. They paint what the public sees and the public never sees anything.,??
Popularity is the only insult that has not yet been offered to Mr. Whistler.,??
Popularity is the crown of laurel which the world puts on bad art. Whatever is popular is wrong.,??
Popularity is the one insult I have never suffered.,??
The play was a great success but the audience was a disaster.,??
Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their distinguishing characteristic.,??
When one pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people's time not one's own.,??

No work of art ever puts forward views. Views belong to people who are not artists.,??
The sign of a Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art.,??
Disobedience in the eyes of any one who has read history is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made through disobedience and through rebellion.,??
The final mystery is oneself.,??
Music makes one feel so romantic - at least it always gets on one's nerves - which is the same thing nowadays.,??
If one hears bad music it is one's duty to drown it by one's conversation.,??
Music is the art which is most nigh to tears and memory.,??
There is no such thing as morality or immorality in thought. There is immoral emotion.,??
I never approve or disapprove of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say and I never interfere with what charming people do.,??
A man who moralizes is usually a hypocrite and a woman who moralizes is invariably plain.,??
For an artist to marry his model is as fatal as for a gourmet to marry his cook: the one gets no sittings and the other gets no dinners.,??
Life would be dull without them.,??
What is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?,??
The Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means and always mean much more than he says.,??
For his mourners will be outcast men and outcasts always mourn.,??
A misanthrope I can understand - a womanthrope never,??
The proper basis for marriage is mutual misunderstanding,??
I know of course how important it is not to keep a business engagement if one wants to retain any sense of the beauty of life.,??
In old days men had the rack. Now they have the Press.,??
When a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband. When a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.,??
Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building.,??
Marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree.,??
Marriage is the triumph of imagination over intelligence. Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience.,??
Ultimately the bond of all companionship whether in marriage or in friendship is conversation.,??
On the whole the great success of marriage in the States is due partly to the fact that no American man is ever idle and partly to the fact that no American wife is considered responsible for the quality of her husband's dinners.,??
Long engagements give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage which is never advisable.,??
They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face as if it were the most fascinating of sins.,??
Women represent the triumph of matter over mind just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.,??
We have little time and lots to do lets take time for everything we do.,??
Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it but moulds it to its purpose. The nineteenth century as we know it is largely an invention of Balzac.,??
The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation not instruction is the aim of conversation and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company.,??
As one knows the poet by his fine music so one can recognize the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance and in neither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice. Here as elsewhere practice must precede perfection.,??
When liberty comes with hands dabbled in blood it is hard to shake hands with her.,??
Cultivated leisure is the aim of man.,??
The mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop all monsters and dust with everything priced above its proper value.,??
A kiss may ruin a human life.,??
The way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test Reality we must see it on the tight-rope. When the Verities become acrobats we can judge them.,??
It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is a proper judge of it,??
Sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of sympathy in the world sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain.,??
The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable and literature is not read,??
It was a fatal day when the public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone and can be made as offensive as the brickbat. They at once sought for the journalist found him developed him and made him their industrious and well-paid servant. It is greatly to be regretted for both their sakes.,??
There is much to be said in favor of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life it shows us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture and what are not.,??
Bad manners make a journalist.,??
The best way to appreciate your job is to imagine yourself without one.,??
Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is far the best ending for one.,??
A man's face is his autobiography. A woman's face is her work of fiction.,??
Perhaps after all America never has been discovered. I myself would say that it had merely been detected.,??

Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching.,??
All that I desire to point out is the general principle that life imitates art far more than art imitates life.,??
There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.,??
Ordinary riches can be stolen; real riches cannot. In your soul are infinitely precious things that cannot be taken from you.,??
In America the President reigns for four years and Journalism governs forever and ever.,??

They are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they are not.,??
The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes.,??

In the old times men carried out their rights for themselves as they lived but nowadays every baby seems born with a social manifesto in its mouth much bigger than itself.,??
The only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes. Change is the one quality we can predicate of it. The systems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human nature and not on its growth and development. The error of Louis XIV was that he thought human nature would always be the same. The result of his error was the French Revolution. It was an admirable result.,??
It is because Humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way.,??

A true gentleman is one who is never unintentionally rude.,??
Put your talent into your work but your genius into your life,??
From the point of view of literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates. From the point of view of life he is a reporter who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it.,??
Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.,??

The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.,??
A chemist on each side will approach the frontier with a bottle,??

It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.,??
I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works.,??
When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers.,??
I love talking about nothing. It is the only thing I know anything about.,??

An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.,??
Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.,??

In examinations the foolish ask questions the wise cannot answer.,??
Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.,??
Flowers are as common in the country as people are in London.,??
The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.,??
Yet each man kills the thing he loves By each let this be heard Some do it with a bitter look Some with a flattering word. The coward does it with a kiss The brave man with a sword!,??
People who love only once in their lives are shallow people. What they call their loyalty and their fidelity I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect -- simply a confession of failures.,??
One should not be too severe on English novels; they are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed.,??
"When they reached the end of the room he stopped and muttered some words she could not understand.

I live in fear of not being misunderstood,??

There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.,??
None of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.,??
The American father is never seen in London. He passes his life entirely in Wall Street and communicates with his family once a month by means of a telegram in cipher.,??
Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern; one is apt to grow old fashioned quite suddenly.,??
Woman's first duty in life is to her dressmaker. What the second duty is no one has yet discovered.,??
Fashion by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment the universal.,??
It is only the modern that ever becomes old fashioned.,??
And now I am dying beyond my means. [Sipping champagne on his deathbed],??
I can believe anything provided it is incredible.,??
What a fuss people make about fidelity! Why even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful and are not; old men want to be faithless and cannot: that is all one can say.,??
Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.,??
Misfortunes one can endure -- they come from outside they are accidents. But to suffer for one's own faults -- Ah! there is the sting of life.,??
We Irish are too poetical to be poets; we are a nation of brilliant failures but we are the greatest talkers since the Greeks.,??
Newspapers. . . give us the bald sordid disgusting facts of life. They chronicle with degrading avidity the sins of the second-rate and with the conscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaic details. . .,??
Disobedience in the eyes of anyone who has read history is man's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made through disobedience and through rebellion.,??
Where there is no extravagance there is no love and where there is no love there is no understanding.,??
Extravagance is the luxury of the poor; penury is the luxury of the rich,??

An ordinary man away from home giving advice.,??
Experience is the name every one gives to their mistakes.,??
To get back to my youth I would do anything in the world except take exercise get up early or be respectable,??
The only possible form of exercise is to talk not to walk.,??
Good taste is the excuse I've always given for leading such a bad life,??
Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess.,??
Examinations sir are pure humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him.,??
The only difference between saints and sinners is that every saint has a past while every sinner has a future.,??
The great things in life are what they seem to be. And for that reason strange as it may sound to you often are very difficult to interpret (understand). Great passion are for the great of souls. Great events can only be seen by people who are on a level with them. We think we can have our visions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing visions have to paid for. Strangely enough that is what makes them fine.,??
Nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.,??
No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.,??
Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.,??
I love acting. It is so much more real than life.,??
There is something tragic about the enormous number of young men there are in England at the present moment who start life with perfect profiles and end by adopting some useful profession.,??
Pardon me you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged to some one I or your father should his health permit him will inform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise pleasant or unpleasant as the case may be. It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself.,??
In all matters of opinion our adversaries are insane.,??
In the wild struggle for existance we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place.,??
The modern sympathy with invalids is morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.,??
There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.,??
I am the only person in the world I should like to know thoroughly.,??
I have nothing to declare except my genius.,??
The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England at any rate education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes and probably lead to acts of violence.,??
Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.,??
The first duty of life is to be as artificial as possible. What the second duty is no one as yet discovered.,??
Mr. Henry James writes fiction as if it were a painful duty.,??
Oh duty is what one expects from others it is not what one does oneself.,??
The one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it.,??
Dullness is the coming of age of seriousness.,??
One should either be a work of art or wear a work of art.,??
Society often forgives the criminal; it never forgives the dreamer.,??
It is he who has broken the bond of marriage -- not I. I only break its bondage.,??
Never speak disrespectfully of Society. Only people who can't get into it do that.,??
She is absolutely inadmissible into society. Many a woman has a past but I am told that she has at least a dozen and that they all fit.,??
Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.,??
Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation,??
If the poor only had profiles there would be no difficulty in solving the problem of poverty,??
Of course the music is a great difficulty. You see if one plays good music people don't listen and if one plays bad music people don't talk.,??
Better the rule of One whom all obey than to let clamorous demagogues betray our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.,??
I have met a lot of hardboiled eggs in my time but you're twenty minutes.,??
There is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that.,??
Despotism is unjust to everybody including the despot who was probably made for better things.,??
Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her. Misery wakes us in the morning and Shame sits with us at night.,??
Why was I born with such contemporaries?,??
There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants and the other is getting it.,??
A sentimentalist is simply one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it,??
I don't want to earn my living; I want to live.,??
Life is never fair and perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.,??
It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist. It produced a false impression.,??
Democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.,??
I must decline your invitation owing to a subsequent engagement,??
Deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.,??
A man who pays his bills on time is soon forgotten,??
Relations are simply a tedious pack of people who haven't the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die,??
And the wild regrets and the bloody sweats none knew so well as I: for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die.,??
A thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it.,??
No man dies for what he knows to be true. Men die for what they want to be true for what some terror in their hearts tells them is not true.,??
People who love only once in their lives are. . . shallow people. What they call their loyalty and their fidelity I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.,??
Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.,??
It is a dangerous thing to reform anyone.,??
A little sincerity is a dangerous thing and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal.,??
All great ideas are dangerous.,??
An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.,??
What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.,??
The security of Society lies in custom and unconscious instinct and the basis of the stability of Society as a healthy organism is the complete absence of any intelligence amongst its members.,??
The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything.  Except what is worth knowing.  Journalism conscious of this and having tradesman-like habits supplies their demands.,??
The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything except what is worth knowing,??
It is a curious fact that people are never so trivial as when they take themselves seriously.,??
Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic -- a temperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty and to the various impressions that beauty gives us.,??
That is what the highest criticism really is the record of one's own soul. It is more fascinating than history as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is more delightful than philosophy as its subject is concrete and not abstract real and not vague. It is the only civilized form of autobiography.,??
On an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure.,??
No publisher should ever express an opinion on the value of what he publishes. That is a matter entirely for the literary critic to decide. I can quite understand how any ordinary critic would be strongly prejudiced against a work that was accompanied by a premature and unnecessary panegyric from the publisher. A publisher is simply a useful middle-man. It is not for him to anticipate the verdict of criticism.,??
The true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations and to whom no form of thought is alien no emotional impulse obscure.,??
Crying is the refuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones.,??
It (cricket) requires one to assume such indecent postures,??
To elope is cowardly; it is running away from danger; and danger has become so rare in modern life,??
We degenerate into hideous puppets haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were much afraid and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.,??
Do you really think it is weakness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there are terrible temptations which it requires strength strength and courage to yield to.,??
If a man needs an elaborate tombstone in order to remain in the memory of his country it is clear that his living at all was an act of absolute superfluity.,??
To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist -- the problem is entirely the same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's vinegar.,??
Talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.,??
When people talk to me about the weather I always feel they mean something else.,??
The liar at any rate recognizes that recreation not instruction is the aim of conversation and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company,??
Conversation about the weather is the last refuge of the unimaginative.,??
A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them to enjoy them and to dominate them.,??
Who is that man over there? I don't know him. What is he doing? Is he a conspirator? Have you searched him? Give him till tomorrow to confess then hang him! -- hang him!,??
Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative.,??
The consciousness of loving and being loved brings a warmth and richness to lifethat nothing else can bring.,??
The great events of life often leave one unmoved; they pass out of consciousness and when one thinks of them become unreal. Even the scarlet flowers of passion seem to grow in the same meadow as the poppies of oblivion.,??
Conscience makes egotists of us all.,??
There is nothing in the whole world so unbecoming to a woman as a Nonconformist conscience.,??
Conscience and cowardice are really the same things. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.,??
A red rose is not selfish because it wants to be a red rose. It would be horribly selfish if it wanted all the other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses.,??
A man's very highest moment is I have no doubt at all when he kneels in the dust and beats his breast and tells all the sins of his life.,??
Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect - simply a confession of failures,??
I don't at all like knowing what people say of me behind my back. It makes me far too conceited.,??
Ah nowadays we are all of us so hard up that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments. They're the only things we can pay.,??
I don't like compliments and I don't see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn't mean,??
Women are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference between the sexes.,??
Its failings notwithstanding there is much to be said in favor of journalism in that by giving us the opinion of the uneducated it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.,??
There is much to be said in favour of modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community.,??
Public Opinion... an attempt to organize the ignorance of the community and to elevate it to the dignity of physical force.,??
Mere color unspoiled by meaning and unallied with definite form can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.,??
Mere colour unspoiled by meaning and unallied with definite form can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.,??
He had that curious love of green which in individuals is always the sign of a subtle artistic temperament and in nations is said to denote a laxity if not a decadence of morals.,??
In spite of the roaring of the young lions at the Union and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisect in spite of Keble College and the tramways and the sporting prints Oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in England and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended so perfectly made one.,??
The exquisite art of idleness one of the most important things that any University can teach.,??
Society produces rogues and education makes one rogue cleverer than another.,??
How clever you are my dear! You never mean a single word you say.,??
Judges like the criminal classes have their lighter moments,??
There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating; people who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing.,??
There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else.,??
Agitators are a set of interfering meddling people who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them.  That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary.,??
Really if the lower orders don't set us a good example what on earth is the use of them? They seem as a class to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.,??
Each class preaches the importance of those virtues it need not exercise. The rich harp on the value of thrift the idle grow eloquent over the dignity of labor.,??
If one could only teach the English how to talk and the Irish how to listen society here would be quite civilized.,??
Civilisation is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured the other by being corrupt.,??
Comfort is the only thing our civilization can give us.,??
Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured the other by being corrupt.,??
A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want?,??
Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them. The old fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.,??
The best way to make children good is to make them happy,??
She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.,??
All charming people I fancy are spoiled. It is the secret of their attraction.,??
The one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.,??
Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the privilege of the rich not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating.,??
While to the claims of charity a man may yield and yet be free to the claims of conformity no man may yield and remain free at all,??
Charity creates a multitude of sins.,??
Charity dear Miss Prism charity! None of us are perfect. I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.,??
It is only the superficial qualities that last. Man's deeper nature is soon found out.,??
Women have a wonderful instinct about things. They can discover everything except the obvious.,??
Every woman is a rebel and usually in wild revolt against herself.,??
He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realise.,??
His style is chaos illumined by flashes of lightning. As a writer he has mastered everything except language.,??
The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.,??
The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.,??
The brotherhood of man is not a mere poet's dream: it is a most depressing and humiliating reality,??
To disagree with three-fourths of the British public is one of the first requisites of sanity,??
The books that the world calls immoral are the books that show the world its own shame.,??
Anybody can write a three-volume novel. It merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature.,??
The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.,??
If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again there is no use in reading it at all.,??
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all.,??
Sins of the flesh are nothing. Sins of the soul are shameful.,??
There are three kinds of despots. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the body. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul. There is the despot who tyrannizes over the soul and body alike. The first is called the Prince. The second is called the Pope. The third is called the People.,??
And the wild regrets and the bloody sweats None knew so well as I: That he who lives more lives than one More deaths than one shall die.,??
Hatred is blind as well as love.,??
What seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise,??
There is luxury in self reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel no one else has a right to blame us.,??
It's not whether you win or lose it's how you place the blame.,??
One should never trust a woman who tells her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell anything.,??
The well bred contradict other people. The wise contradict themselves.,??
Formerly we used to canonize our heroes. The modern method is to vulgarize them. Cheap editions of great books may be delightful but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable.,??
A true friend stabs you in the front.,??
Those who are faithless know the pleasures of love; it is the faithful who know love's tragedies,??
He would stab his best friend for the sake of writing an epigram on his tombstone.,??
Newspapers have degenerated. They may now be absolutely relied upon.,??
I can believe anything as long as it is incredible,??
People fashion their God after their own understanding. They make their God first and worship him afterwards.,??
To believe is very dull. To doubt is intensely engrossing.,??
Vulgarity is the conduct of other people just as falsehoods are the truths of other people,??
Scepticism is the beginning of Faith.,??
To love one's self is the beginning of a life-long romance,??
As for begging it is safer to beg than to take but it is finer to take than to beg.,??
Beauty is a form of genius -- is higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts in the world like sunlight or springtime or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon.,??
You are young. No hungry generations tread you down.... The past does not mock you with the ruins of a beauty the secret of whose creation you have lost...,??
Beauty is a form of genius - is higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation.  It is of the great facts in the world like sunlight or springtime or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon.,??
The only beautiful things are the things that do not concern us.,??
There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the color the beauty the joy of life. The less said about life's sores the better.,??
Hear no evil speak no evil - and you'll never be invited to a party,??
I have found that all ugly things are made by those who strive to make something beautiful and that all beautiful things are made by those who strive to make something useful.,??
It is absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.,??
The good ended happily and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means.,??
The fact is you have fallen lately Cecily into a bad habit of thinking for yourself. You should give it up. It is not quite womanly... men don't like it.,??
If one hears bad music it is one's duty to drown it by one's conversation,??
By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation. Men should be more careful.,??
Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married men.,??
Authority is quite degrading,??
There is no necessity to separate the monarch from the mob; all authority is equally bad.,??
The play was a great success but the audience was a disaster,??
One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.,??
Men always want to be a woman's first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We woman have a more subtle instinct about things. What we like is to be a man's last romance.,??
The world has grown suspicious of anything that looks like a happily married life.,??
Between the optimist and the pessimist the difference is droll. The optimist sees the doughnut; the pessimist the hole!,??
I can't help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.,??
By persistently remaining single a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.,??
One should always play fairly when one has the winning cards.,??
Married men are horribly tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they are not,??
We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars.,??
I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning and took out a comma. In the afternoon I put it back again.,??
You should study the Peerage Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done.,??
Argument are to be avoided; they are always vulgar and often convincing.,??
I dislike arguments of any kind. They are always vulgar and often convincing.,??
I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound. Fortunately in England at any rate education produces no effect whatsoever. If it did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.,??
Pleasure is Nature's test her sign of approval. When man is happy he is in harmony with himself and his environment.,??
I never approve or disapprove of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say and I never interfere with what charming pe,??
The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly deceived,??
A mask tells us more than a face.,??
A mans face is his autobiography. A women's face is her work of fiction.,??
It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances,2
I never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky.,??
It is better to be beautiful than to be good but it is better to be good than to be ugly.,??
All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.,??
A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on,2
Plain women are always jealous of their husbands. Beautiful women never are. They are always so occupied with being jealous of other women's husbands.,??
Fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.,??
It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible.,??
The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her if she is pretty and to someone else if she is plain.,??
No object is so beautiful that under certain conditions it will not look ugly.,??
To get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people amuse people or shock people,2
It is very vulgar to talk about one's business. Only people like stockbrokers do that and then merely at dinner parties.,2
There is no country in the world where machinery is so lovely as in America.,??
And by the way one of the most delightful things I find in America is meeting a people without prejudice -- everywhere open to the truth.,??
The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It has been going on now for three hundred years.,??
In America the young are always ready to give to those older than themselves the full benefit of their inexperience,??
In going to America one learns that poverty is not a necessary accompaniment to civilization.,??
America had often been discovered before Columbus but it had always been hushed up.,??
Perhaps after all America never has been discovered. I myself would say that it has merely been detected.,??
America has never quite forgiven Europe for having been discovered somewhat earlier in history than itself.,??
We have really everything in common with America nowadays except of course language.,??
In America the President reigns for four years and Journalism governs for ever and ever,??
Of course America had often been discovered before Columbus but it had always been hushed up.,??
America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between.,??
Thirty-five is a very attractive age. London society is full of women of the highest birth who have of their own free choice remained thirty-five for years.,??
The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young.,??
How sad it is! I shall grow old and horrid and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June. . . . If it was only the other way! If it was I who were to be always young and the picture that were to grow old! For this--for this--I would give everything! Yes there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!,??
My experience is that as soon as people are old enough to know better they don't know anything at all.,??
He to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives.,??
Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons. What this century worships is wealth. The God of this century is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all costs one must have wealth.,??
I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime.,??
The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.,??
Young men want to be faithful and are not; old men want to be faithless and cannot.,??

In America the young are always ready to give to those who are older than themselves the full benefits of their inexperience.,??
We live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities.,??
The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life. And the body is born young and grows old. That is life's tragedy.,??
The old believe everything; the middle aged suspect everything: the young know everything.,??
The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young,??
An inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining young,??
One should never make one's debut in a scandal. One should reserve that to give interest to one's old age.,??
The man had killed the thing he loved And so he had to die,??
The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.,??
There is no sin except stupidity.,??
Don't give a woman advice:  one should never give a woman anything she can't wear in the evening,??
It is always a silly thing to give advice but to give good advice is absolutely fatal,??
